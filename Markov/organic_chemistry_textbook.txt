PREFACE TO FIFTH EDITION 



This is the second time that we have prepared a new edition of Vogel's Textbook 
of Organic Chemistry and it is important to reaffirm the aims set out by the late 
Dr A. I. Vogel in the preface to the first edition. Thus in this new edition every 
endeavour is made to retain the comprehensive character of the book, and to 
ensure that it continues to be a one-volume reference text which is of value to 
practising organic chemists throughout their undergraduate, postgraduate and 
subsequent careers. 

During the preparation of the previous (fourth) edition considerable reorgan- 
isation and rewriting ol the text was necessary. This arose from the many 
changes which had taken place in the practice and theory of organic chemistry 
during the preceding twenty years. Among these changes were the ready avail- 
ability of a much wider range of substrates and reagents; the development of a 
whole host of new synthetic reagents; a greater awareness of the hazards asso- 
ciated with handling of organic chemicals; the routine use of chromatographic 
and spectroscopic techniques; and the use of mechanistic concepts to rationalise 
and predict the outcome of organic reactions. That revision included a modified 
chapter on experimental techniques, which was arranged under the headings 
'Apparatus and reaction procedures', 'Isolation and purification processes', and 
'Determination of physical constants'. New sections were introduced on safe 
working in organic laboratories, chromatography, and spectroscopic methods. 
The interpretation of spectroscopic data was discussed in the reorganised 
chapter entitled Qualitative Organic Analysis. The preparative chapters were 
reorganised on the basis of aliphatic compounds, aromatic compounds, alicyclic 
compounds, and heterocyclic compounds, and within these chapters a selection 
of new synthetic methods was introduced. Following the practice adopted in 
previous editions these new preparations were checked in the laboratories of the 
School of Chemistry, Thames Polytechnic. 

In this new (fifth) edition, in order to ensure that the book retains its rele- 
vance to current teaching of organic chemistry, we have adopted the same struc- 
ture of the book since we are of the opinion that it provides a bridge between the 
treatment of organic chemistry theory provided by current standard under- 
graduate textbooks, and the wider specialist fields of the research literature. 
Furthermore, in addition to the introduction of new reagents and techniques, 
the last decade has seen the development of a philosophy of organic synthesis 
(the strategy of synthesis) which was just beginning to emerge during the writing 
of the previous edition. It is our intention to reflect this development, since we 
consider that the teaching of organic chemistry must closely integrate mechanis- 
tic theory with the strategy and methodology of synthesis. 

xvii 



PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION 



The book now commences with Chapter 1, Organic Synthesis, which reviews 
the important concepts which need to be borne in mind when considering the 
problem: 'how may compound X be synthesised?' The chapter discusses the 
structural and stereoisomeric features of molecules, the importance of control, 
selectivity and protection in organic reaction sequences, and the increasing im- 
portance of asymmetric synthesis. These topics are developed further in the sub- 
sequent text. The use of computers in organic synthesis is reviewed, and this 
topic leads to a short summary of the most significant contribution to the teach- 
ing of organic synthesis of the recent decade, namely the disconnection (or syn- 
thon) approach developed by Dr S. Warren and based upon the original 
concept of Professor E. J. Corey. This approach has been integrated with the 
theoretical discussions on preparative procedures which precede the preparative 
examples in the aliphatic and aromatic chapters. In particular the retrosynthetic 
analysis of target molecules has provided a framework around which the later 
alicyclic and heterocyclic chapters have been rewritten. By using this approach 
we hope that undergraduates and others, who become acquainted with this 
philosophy in lectures and tutorials, may find this text a useful further source of 
information. 

The first three sections of Chapter 2 deal with Codes of Practice and respons- 
ibility, and a summary of hazards which may be encountered in the organic 
chemistry laboratory. These are intended to acquaint the student with the essen- 
tial features of safe working practice, and to advise strongly on the importance 
of consulting with senior members of the laboratory or the appointed safety 
officer, and of consulting comprehensive specialist texts which should be readily 
accessible to laboratory users. In particular the advice of safety officers should 
be sought, since by virtue of their office they have available the latest informa- 
tion. Hazards associated with particular chemicals and procedures are noted in 
the text as far as information is available. The remainder of Chapter 2, Experi- 
mental Techniques, has been up-dated on the availability of new equipment and 
the applicability of new techniques. An important section on reactions involving 
air-sensitive compounds has been introduced. The chromatography section now 
includes the important preparative techniques of flash chromatography, dry 
column flash chromatography and the 'Chromatotron', together with a fuller 
discussion on high-performance liquid chromatography. 

Spectroscopic methods and the interpretation of spectra are now treated to- 
gether in Chapter 3. The most significant addition to this chapter is a more 
detailed coverage, with examples of spectra, of 13 C-n.m.r. spectroscopy which is 
considered alongside ' H-n.m.r. spectroscopy. The inclusion of detailed spectro- 
scopic data in the preparative chapters has vastly increased the opportunities for 
practise by the reader in problems relating to elucidation of structure. Thus each 
functional group section in the aliphatic and aromatic chapters includes a 
summarising statement of the important spectroscopic features, and many of the 
preparations conclude with a description of key data. These spectroscopic data 
are only quoted if they provide information for the student from which a definit- 
ive structural assignment may be deduced. The information is quoted in several 
styles. If the spectrum (i.r., n.m.r., m.s., or u.v.-visible) is simple and straight- 
forward the style is of the type 'record and interpret (assign)'. If the spectrum has 
interesting interpretative features, the spectroscopic details are quoted and some 
guidance is provided to assist in the elucidation of structure. If, and this is par-

ticularly appropriate with aromatic compounds, regioisomers may be com- 
pared, these features are noted. 

Chapter 4, Solvents and Reagents, has been extended to include important 
new reagents including alkyllithiums, boranes and new oxidants and reductants, 
which are used in subsequent chapters. 

Approximately 100 new experiments have been introduced into the prepara- 
tive chapters [Aliphatic (Ch. 5), Aromatic (Ch. 6), Alicyclic (Ch. 7), and Hetero- 
cyclic (Ch. 8)]. Of particular interest is the introduction of some illustrative 
asymmetric syntheses, important protection methods, the use of air- and 
moisture-sensitive reagents, the wider use of phase transfer reactions, silicon, 
phosphorus, boron, and titanium reagents, as well as examples of important 
named reactions. The procedures for these new reactions have been quoted 
directly from the literature but not checked in the laboratory. The examples 
have been selected on the basis of their interest, generality and importance. The 
style of presentation of these new experiments is sometimes somewhat briefer 
than that of those experiments retained from previous editions, but we believe 
that they provide a useful introduction for the advanced student to research 
methods. Many further examples of reagents and techniques have been noted in 
the theoretical discussions. They have been included since they provide possible 
project ideas for further investigation by advanced students. It is hoped that all 
these experiments will provide suitable material for the design of a full range of 
practical courses. Finally, as noted above, the theoretical discussions have been 
rewritten to provide an integrated and balanced coverage of mechanisms, metho- 
dology and strategy in synthesis. 

Chapter 9, Investigation and Characterisation of Organic Compounds, con- 
tains much of the chemical information and preparative methods from the 
chapter previously entitled Qualitative Analysis. The emphasis of this chapter is 
now on achieving an understanding of chemical behaviour in association with 
spectroscopic features, and correlating this information to provide a definitive 
structural elucidation. In this way we hope that the material fulfils the require- 
ments of a range of courses which deal in this topic. The tables of physical con- 
stants (Ch. 10) remain unchanged, and the appendices have been up-dated. , 

We wish to thank Professor B. R. Currell, Ph.D., C.Chem, F.R.S.C, and Dr 
J. R. Parsonage, C.Chem., F.R.S.C, former and current Heads of School of 
Chemistry at Thames Polytechnic, for their interest in this project and for grant- 
ing permission for the use of various facilities. We are indebted to Dr E. Vidgeon 
for recording the majority of the 13 C-n.m.r. spectra, and to Mr V. Kyte and Mr 
J. Williams for providing information on the availability and usage of labora- 
tory equipment. The assistance of the company representatives of very many 
manufacturers of chemicals and of laboratory, spectroscopic and chromato- 
graphic equipment has been invaluable; general and specific help is noted in the 
acknowledgements. We are indebted to the referees who made valuable com- 
ments on the manuscript which undoubtedly helped to improve the final text.

PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION 



The present volume is an attempt to give to students of practical organic 
chemistry the benefit of some twenty years' experience in research and teaching 
of the subject. The real foundations of the author's knowledge of the subject 
were laid in 1925-1929 when, as a research student at the Imperial College under 
the late Professor J. F. Thorpe, F.R.S., he was introduced to the methods and 
experimental technique employed in a large and flourishing school of research in 
organic chemistry. Since that period the author and his students have been en- 
gaged inter alia in researches on Physical Properties and Chemical Constitution 
(published in the Journal of the Chemical Society) and this has involved the pre- 
paration of over a thousand pure compounds of very varied type. Many of the 
new procedures and much of the specialised technique developed and employed 
in these researches are incorporated in this book. Furthermore, new experiments 
for the elementary student have emanated from these researches; these have 
been tried out with large classes of undergraduate students over several sessions 
with gratifying success and have now been included in the present textbook. 

In compiling this book, the author has drawn freely from all sources of in- 
formation available to him - research notes, original memoirs in scientific 
journals, reference works on organic chemistry, the numerous textbooks on 
practical organic chemistry, and pamphlets of manufacturers of specialised 
apparatus. Whilst individual acknowledgement cannot obviously be made - in 
many cases the original source has been lost track of- it is a duty and a pleasure 
to place on record the debt the writer owes to all these sources. Mention must, 
however, be made of Organic Syntheses, to which the reader is referred for 
further details of many of the preparations described in the text. 

The book opens with a chapter on the theory underlying the technique of the 
chief operations of practical organic chemistry: it is considered that a proper 
understanding of these operations cannot be achieved without a knowledge of 
the appropriate theoretical principles. Chapter II is devoted to a detailed discus- 
sion of experimental technique; the inclusion of this subject in one chapter leads 
to economy of space, particularly in the description of advanced preparations. It 
is not expected that the student will employ even the major proportion of the 
operations described, but a knowledge of their existence is thought desirable for 
the advanced student so that he may apply them when occasion demands. 

Chapters III and IV are confined to the preparation and properties of 
Aliphatic Compounds and Aromatic Compounds respectively. This division, 
although perhaps artificial, falls into line with the treatment in many of the exist- 
ing theoretical textbooks and also with the author's own lecture courses. A short 
theoretical introduction precedes the detailed preparations of the various classes 



PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 



of organic compounds: it is recommended that these be read concurrently with 
the student's lecture course and, it is hoped, that with such reading the subject 
will become alive and possess real meaning. The partition of the chapters in this 
manner provides the opportunity of introducing the reactions and the methods 
of characterisation of the various classes of organic compounds; the foundations 
of qualitative organic analysis are thus laid gradually, but many teachers may 
prefer to postpone the study of this subject until a representative number of ele- 
mentary preparations has been carried out by the student. The division into sec- 
tions will facilitate the introduction of any scheme of instruction which the 
teacher considers desirable. 

Chapters V-X deal respectively with Heterocyclic and Alicyclic Compounds; 
Miscellaneous Reactions; Organic Reagents in Inorganic and Organic Chemistry; 
Dyestuffs, Indicators and Related Compounds; Some Physiologically-Active 
Compounds; and Synthetic Polymers. Many of these preparations are of course 
intended for advanced students, but a mere perusal of the experimental details of 
selected preparations by those whose time for experimental-work is limited may 
assist to impress them on the memory. Attention is particularly directed to the 
chapter on Organic Reagents in Inorganic and Organic Chemistry. It is always a 
good plan to set advanced students or adequately-trained laboratory assistants 
on the preparation of those compounds which are required in the laboratory for 
organic and inorganic analysis; the resulting cost is comparatively low (for 
o-phenanthroline, for example, it is less than one-tenth of the commercial price) 
and will serve to promote the use of these, otherwise relatively expensive, 
organic reagents in the laboratory. 

Chapter XI is devoted to Qualitative Organic Analysis. The subject is 
dicussed in moderate detail and this, coupled with the various Sections and 
Tables of Physical Constants of Organic Compounds and their Derivatives in 
Chapters III and IV, will provide a satisfactory course of study in this important 
branch of chemistry. No attempt that has been made to deal with Quantitative 
Organic Analysis in this volume. 

The textbook is intended to meet the requirements of the student of chemistry 
throughout the whole of his training. Considerable detail is given in those sec- 
tions of particular interest to the elementary student; in the author's opinion it is 
the duty of a writer of a practical textbook to lay a secure foundation of sound 
experimental technique for the beginner. The subject matter of the book is suffi- 
ciently comprehensive to permit the teacher to cover any reasonable course of 
instruction. It will be observed that the scale of the preparations varies consider- 
ably; the instructor can easily adapt the preparation to a smaller scale when such 
a step is necessary from considerations of cost and time or for other reasons. 
Quantities of liquid reagents are generally expressed as weights and volumes: the 
latter refer to a temperature of 20 °. The book will be suitable for students pre- 
paring for the Pass and Honours (General and Special) B.Sc. of the Universities, 
the A.R.I.C. and the F.R.I.C. (Organic Chemistry). It will also provide an intro- 
duction to research methods in organic chemistry and, it is hoped, may serve as 
an intermediate reference book for practising organic chemists. 

Attention is directed to the numerous references, particularly in Chapter II 
on Experimental Technique, to firms supplying specialised apparatus. The 
author has usually had first-hand experience with this apparatus and he feels 
that some readers may wish to know the present source of supply and also from 
whom to obtain additional information. It must be mentioned that most of the

specialised apparatus has been introduced to the market for the first time by the 
respective firms after much development research and exhaustive tests in their 
laboratories. A reference to such a firm is, in the writer's opinion, equivalent to 
an original literature reference or to a book. During the last decade or two much 
development work has been carried out in the laboratories of the manufacturers 
of chemical apparatus (and also of industrial chemicals) and some acknowledge- 
ment of the great help rendered to practical organic chemists by these industrial 
organisations is long overdue; it is certainly no exaggeration to state that they 
have materially assisted the advancement of the science. A short list of the vari- 
ous firms is given on the next page.*

CHAPTER 1 

ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 



1.1 INTRODUCTION 

This book aims to reflect comprehensively the many and varied aspects of prac- 
tical organic chemistry with which the student will need to become familiar. The 
synthesis of organic compounds is traditionally an important part of the train- 
ing of an organic chemist. By undertaking the preparation of a varied range of 
compounds, and using a representative selection of reaction processes and tech- 
niques, the prospective organic chemist becomes familiar with the chemical and 
physical properties of organic substances and begins to understand more clearly 
the factors which govern their reactivity. The discussion sections which are sited 
before the relevant experimental procedures provide a bridge between labora- 
tory work and lecture material. Thus while the synthesis of quite simple com- 
pounds is of considerable educational value, particularly if the reactions 
involved are of a general nature, wider reading of a selection of the excellent 
review articles that are cited at the ends of chapters, should enable the advanced 
student of organic chemistry to appreciate the wider implications of the reac- 
tions under consideration. 

The student will become increasingly aware, during the early years of train- 
ing, of the very great range of concepts and techniques with which the practising 
organic chemist has to be familiar. Some of these may be summarised as follows: 

1. The preparative, isolation and purification techniques (including the use of a 
varied range of chromatographic procedures), which are applicable to quan- 
tities of reactants and products from milligram to kilogram amounts. 

2. The chemical procedures which are used for the structural characterisation of 
pure compounds, together with the routine application of the various 
spectroscopic methods. 

3. The ever-increasing range of new reagents and reaction procedures which may 

replace older methods by reason of their greater specificity or increased safety 
in use. 

4. The enormous body of theoretical ideas which enable the manner in which 
compounds interact to be understood in terms of the reaction mechanism 
and, if appropriate, stereochemical factors. 

5. The applications of computer techniques, initially in the area of literature 
searching, educational aids, and interfacing with many instrumental tech- 
niques, but more recently as an invaluable aid to the design of synthetic 
routes to complex organic molecules. 

1 



1.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The attainment of a comprehensive appreciation in each of these overlapping 
and interrelated areas is a formidable objective for the new student. The integ- 
ration of the theory of organic chemistry which has been acquired in lectures 
and tutorials with the practical experience gained in the preparative, chromato- 
graphic and spectroscopic laboratories is a challenging prospect. 

The key question, 'how may compound X be synthesised?', has been at some 
time or another applied to the countless numbers of compounds prepared in re- 
search and industrial laboratories over a period of the last 1 50 years. It is there- 
fore an interesting reflection that it is only in the last twenty years or so that 
consideration has been given to formalising a philosophy and logic of design in 
organic synthesis. The many brilliant and novel synthetic schemes, often of com- 
pounds of great structural complexity, which have been accomplished in the 
past are attributable largely to the intuitive skills of the research chemist. These 
skills derived from: (a) a sound understanding of an increasing volume of struc- 
tural and stereochemical information; and (b) the ability to apply developing 
mechanistic theory to the transformation of functional groups and to the forma- 
tion of new carbon-carbon skeletal bonds, to select and devise new reagents to 
effect these transformations, and to visualise the 'backward' routes from the 
required target molecule and 'forward' routes from possible starting materials. 
Rarely, however, in the publication of the final synthesis was space devoted to a 
description of how the scheme emerged. A notable recent publication 1 has now 
done much to rectify this omission, by collecting together a series of excellent 
articles, written by research chemists involved in the work, on the strategy and 
tactics of the synthesis of some important and complex structures. 

Today's synthetic organic chemist now has the opportunity to devise syn- 
theses of graded complexity in a more formalised sense, and to recognise the 
potential problems associated with such schemes using developing experience in 
theoretical knowledge and practical expertise. The following sections of this 
chapter provide an overview of these facets of organic synthesis. The references 
to this chapter list some of the valuable texts in general organic chemistry, 2 
organic reaction mechanism, 3 stereoisomerism, 4 and design (methodology and 
strategy) in organic synthesis, 5 together with references to original papers which 
provide some further coverage of the field. 

1.2 STRUCTURE OF THE TARGET MOLECULE 

Following the postulation of the question 'how may compound X be synthe- 
sised?', the first step is to examine the structure of the target molecule. Clearly the 
effectiveness of this examination will depend on the level of structural under- 
standing to which the student has progressed. Compounds (1) to (17) represent 
a selection of structures of varying (and broadly increasing) complexity. First- 
year undergraduate students should be able to recognise readily and to name the 
functional groups in all structures, noting for example that both (1) and (14) 
have a carbon-carbon double bond and a hydroxyl group, and further that the 
hydro xyl group in (1) is primary, whereas in (14) it is secondary; that in (12) the 
functional groups that are present are three carbon-carbon double bonds, a 
keto group, a hydroxyl group and an ester group, etc. The recognition of skeletal 
structures in compounds (1) to (17) by first-year undergraduates may begin to 
falter after (10); thus no difficulty should be experienced with (1) to (4) (open 



ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 1.2 



carbon chain, or aliphatic), (5) and (6) (aromatic), (7) and (8) (carbocyclic, or 
alicyclic), (9) and (10) (heteroaromatic). However, structures (11) to (17) are 
more complex cyclic and polycyclic systems which are not so simply described, 
although the more advanced student should be able to recognise these latter 
structures as representative of the important groups of natural products. These 
are: the terpenes (1 1); the prostanoids (12); the carbohydrates (13); the steroids 
(14); the penicillins (15) and cephalosporins; the alkaloids (16); and macrocyclic 
antibiotics (17).

The recognition of functional and skeletal features leads to a modification of 
the question, 'how may compound X be synthesised?', to a more specific ques- 
tion, say for (9), 'how may the acetyl derivative of 4-aminopyridine be synthe- 
sised?' or for (13), 'what synthetic methods are applied in carbohydrate 
chemistry to effect acetal formation starting from the readily available parent 
monosaccharides?' The examination of structure is not yet complete however. 
The stereoisomeric (optical and geometric) features and the possibility of con- 
formational equilibration, arising from rotation of groups and atoms around 
single bonds, must also be taken into account. Before considering these features, 
it is worth pointing out the advisability of model construction using the Dreid- 
ing and related molecular models, and in certain instances space-filling models. 
These are invaluable, from the earliest stages of study, for acquiring an appreci- 
ation of the shapes of molecules, their stereoisomeric features, their flexibility, 
the 'interaction' of groups within the molecule, and the feasibility and the 
manner of the interaction of the specified compound with a reagent. Computer 
simulations of molecular structures are also increasingly useful tools for this 
purpose. 



OPTICAL ISOMERISM 

A molecule may be defined as achiral or chiral. Whereas an achiral molecule is 
one which is identical with and can be superimposed upon its mirror image, a 
chiral molecule and its mirror image are not superimposable. Each of the pair of 
non-superimposable mirror image isomers (termed enantiomers) rotates the 
plane of polarised light in equal and opposite (dextrorotatory and laevo- 
rotatory) directions. The enantiomers are thus optically active, and a 50:50 
mixture is termed a racemate. The mirror image related structures (2a and 2b) of 
the alkyl halide (2) illustrate the usual way of representation of the directional 
(spatial) arrangement of the four er-bonds of the saturated (s/? 3 -hybridised) 
carbon atom, i.e. two bonds in the plane of the paper, and one pointing forward 
(wedge shaped) and one pointing back (dotted).

The term diastereoisomeric refers to those molecules having the same structure

related. Thus tartaric acid (4) exists as two optically active non-superimposable 
mirror image structures (4a and 4b), each of which is diastereoisomeric with the 
optically inactive meso-tartaric acid (4c).

Whereas enantiomers (e.g. Aa and 4b) have indentical chemical and physical 
properties (except their effect on plane polarised light), diastereoisomers (e.g. 4a, 
or 4b and 4c) frequently differ in their chemical properties, and have different 
physical properties. 

One simple practical method of assessing the possibility of the existence of 
non-superimposable mirror images, particularly with complex structures, is to 
construct models of the two molecules. The property of chirality may alternat- 
ively be described in terms of the symmetry elements of the molecule. If there is a 
lack of all elements of symmetry (i.e. a simple axis, a centre, a plane, or an n-fold 
alternating axis) the chiral molecule is asymmetric, and will possess two non- 
superimposable mirror image structures (e.g. 2a and 2b). If, however, the mole- 
cule possesses a simple axis of symmetry (usually a C 2 axis) but no other sym- 
metry elements, the chiral molecule is dissymmetric. Thus 4a and 4b are 
dissymmetric and the simple C 2 axis of symmetry, of for example 4a, is shown 
below. If the molecule possesses a centre of symmetry (C,) or a plane of sym- 
metry (&lt;r), or an n-fold alternating axis of symmetry (S„), the mirror images of the 
molecule are superimposable and the molecule is optically inactive. These latter 
three symmetry elements are illustrated in the case of the molecule 4c.

Optical activity was first observed with organic compounds having one or 
more chiral carbon atoms (or centres) (i.e. a carbon substituted with four differ- 
ent groups). In the structures (1) to (17) the chiral carbons are specified with an 
asterisk. Subsequently compounds having chiral centres at suitably substituted 
heteroatoms (e.g. silicon, germanium, nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, sulphur, 
etc.) were also synthesised. Molecular dissymmetry, and hence chirality, also 



1.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



arises in molecules which have a chiral axis [e.g. substituted biphenyls such as 
(18), or substituted allenes such as (19)], or a chiral plane [e.g. hexahelicenes 
such as (20), or substituted paracyclophanes such as (21)].

One of the early major problems in the development of an understanding of 
the molecular geometry of optical isomers was the formal representation of the 
individual isomers. It was necessary to show unambiguously the relative spatial 
arrangements of the groups and of the bonding system (the configuration), and 
to relate these representations to the isolated, purified and characterised com- 
pounds (the configurational assignment). One important and long-serving con- 
vention for specifying the configuration of a chiral compound is attributed to 
M. A. Rosanoff (1906). 6 In this notation, dextrorotatory glyceraldehyde (3) was 
arbitrarily specified as having the space arrangement (22). This configuration 
was denoted by the prefix D (i.e. d-( -I- )-glyceraldehyde) thereby specifying that 
the hydroxyl group in this space arrangement lay on the right. The enantiomer 
was designated l-( — )-glyceraldehyde.

It was then possible, by unambiguous chemical interconversion procedures or 
by physical property comparisons, to relate many compounds having one or 
more chiral carbons to either of the enantiomers of glyceraldehyde. This enabled 
a number of chiral compounds to be designated as belonging to the d- or l- 
series; such assignments were thus made on the basis of relative configurations. 
The X-ray analysis of the sodium rubidium salt of optically pure ( + )-tartaric 
acid in 1951 established its absolute configuration as (23). 7 Since this configura- 
tion had been previously related to that of d-( + )-glyceraldehyde, all relative 
configurations of chiral compounds thus assigned were correct in the absolute 
sense. X-ray analysis is now established as the only method that gives directly 



ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 1.2 



the absolute configuration of a chiral compound (i.e. the configurational assign- 
ment does not depend upon any reference standard). 

The d/l convention, though invaluable in the first half of this century, had 
considerable drawbacks since it was inapplicable to compounds having hetero- 
atoms as chiral centres, and could not be used for compounds having chiral axes 
or planes [e.g. structures ( 18) to (21)]; furthermore, it was difficult to apply to all 
centres in molecules having numerous chiral carbons. Such difficulties were 
overcome by the Cahn-lngold-Prelog [(K/S)] notation. 8 Here, a designated set 
of rules for assigning priorities to groups attached to chiral centres, chiral axes 
and chiral planes was proposed, together with a specified way of looking at such 
centres, axes and planes. Finally, if the circular sequence in moving from groups 
of high priority to lower priority was clockwise the notation was (R) (rectus, 
right), or if anticlockwise it was (S) (sinister, left). This is illustrated for ( + )- and 
( — )-glyceraldehyde, which are (R) and (S) respectively, where the priority 
sequence of groups is OH &gt;CHO&gt;CH 2 OH&gt;H.

The convention has over the last three decades proved to be adaptable, ver- 
satile and universal. 9 It should be pointed out, however, that with amino acids 
(Section 5.14.4, p. 746), and hence in peptide and protein chemistry, and with 
carbohydrates (Section 5.10), the d/l convention is still the more convenient, 
mainly because it is used specifically to designate generic relationships between 
an enormous number of compounds of closely related structure. 

Compounds isolated from natural sources are frequently optically pure. Thus 
camphor (11), cholesterol (14), morphine (16), for example, are isolated in the 
optically pure state. The parent molecule of (13) is D-glucose, and like camphor 
and cholesterol is readily available in very large quantities. These, and compar- 
able compounds, form what is now described as a chiral pool, i.e. low-cost, read- 
ily available, chiral compounds which provide starting materials for conversion 
into other compounds, of simplified skeletal and functional structure, in which 
some or all of the chiral features have been retained. 

Compounds synthesised in the laboratory without the use of chiral reagents 
(see asymmetric synthesis p. 15) are always obtained as the racemate. In order to 
separate the individual enantiomers, a resolution process needs to be adopted. 
This aspect is considered in more detail in Section 5.19. 

GEOMETRIC ISOMERISM 

The target molecule also has to be examined for structural features broadly 
known as cis/ trans or geometric isomerism. These isomers differ in all their phys- 
ical properties and in some, but not all, of their chemical properties (they are in 
fact diastereoisomers). The structural features leading to this isomerism are the 
presence of a suitably substituted double bond (carbon-carbon, carbon- 
nitrogen, nitrogen-nitrogen), or the presence of a suitably substituted cyclic 
structure [e.g. substituted cyclopropanes such as (8)]. The cis/ trans notation 
continues to be used for designating the configuration in carbocyclic structures. 



1.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



For example, (7) is £rans-2-methylcyclohexanol; in addition the chirality of C-l 
and C-2 should be designated by the (R/S) notation, and the correct systematic 
name is therefore (lR,2/?)-2-methylcyclohexanol (7a), since the mirror image 
molecule, (lS,2S)-2-methylcyclohexanol {lb) is also the trans isomer. The cis 
isomer is also chiral, and diastereoisomeric with the trans isomer; the two 
enantiomers would be (lS,2R)-2-methylcyclohexanol (24a) and {\R,2S)-2- 
methylcyclohexanol (24b). 






(la) (lb) (24a) (246) 

In the case of ring-fused systems the cis/ trans notation is used to designate the 
geometric nature of the ring junction. Structures (25) and (26) represent partial 
structures of the ring-fused compounds (13) and (14) respectively, which empha- 
sise that the ring junctions utilise cis- or frans-orientated bonds.

In the case of compounds having double bond systems, the configuration is 
best specified by the (E/Z) notation. Here the isomer is designated as (£) 
(entgegen, opposite) if the highest priority groups (as denned by the Cahn- 
Ingold-Prelog rules) attached to each sp 2 -hybridised carbon lie on opposite 
sides of the double bond; the (Z)-isomer (zusammen, together) is that in which 
the groups of highest priority lie on the same side of the double bond. Thus com- 
pound (1) is (£)-but-2-en-l-ol; similarly the configurations of the double bond in 
the side chains of (12) are (£) and (Z); that in (14) is (Z) owing to the constraints 
of the ring system. 

The interconversion of isomers in the case of optical or geometric pairs, if 
structurally feasible, may only take place by the breaking of &lt;r- or 7c-bonds. How- 
ever, there is a further area of stereoisomerism wherein the isomers are inter- 
convertible by rotation about a single (&lt;r) bond, and in general the pure 
stereoisomers are not isolable. These isomers are termed conformational isomers 
or conformers. 

CONFORMATIONAL ISOMERISM 

The term conformation is used to denote any one of the infinite number of 
momentary arrangements of the atoms in space which result from the rotation 
about single bonds. Each of these arrangements will differ in the degree of intra- 
molecular interactions and will thus have differing free energies. The term con- 
former is applied to those discrete spatial arrangements which are at energy 
minima in the continuous potential energy curve resulting from such rotations 



ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 1.2 



in the molecule. Where several minima may be expected, the preferred conformer 
is that with the lowest free energy (i.e. the most stable). The ratio of preferred to 
other conformers, in an equilibrium aggregate of molecules, may be calculated 
from their free energy differences. Molecules are often referred to as conforma- 
tionally^xed, biased, or mobile according to the proportion of the preferred con- 
former and the energy barrier which needs to be surmounted for mutual 
interconversion. 

The concept of conformational preference is widely applied to open-chain 
systems and to substituent groups attached to aromatic rings, to explain differ- 
ences in physical properties (e.g. acidity, basicity, spectroscopic features, etc.), 
and differences in chemical reactivity (both in terms of reaction rates, and of 
reaction course leading to alternative products). Its application to alicyclic 
systems was firstly to cyclohexanes, and to cis and trans decalins, but it is now 
applied to all ring systems (except aromatic and heteroaromatic) regardless of 
structure, size, fusion and bridging. The appreciation of conformational prefer- 
ences marked the beginning of an important area of study in recent decades, 
known as conformational analysis. 10 Here chemical equilibria, and the rates of 
chemical reactions, are considered in relation to the possible conformations of 
reactants and reagents (where appropriate), their mode of approach and the 
favourable mechanistic pathways to transition states and intermediates, and 
finally to the conformational and other stereoisomeric features of the products. 

To elaborate a little on these general principles, four of the structures from 
the (1) to (17) group are re-examined. Thus in (5), AT,./V-dimethyl-/?-nitroaniline, 
rotation of the substituted amino and nitro groups around the bonds linking 
them to the benzene ring could be considered. The energy minimum, and hence 
the most stable arrangement, is that in which the n- and p-electrons of the sub- 
stituent groups overlap with those of the aromatic ring, so that mesomeric inter- 
action is at a maximum (27). The lower basicity of this compound (owing to the 
electron withdrawing effect of the nitro group) in comparison to aniline may 
thus be rationalised. If, however, very bulky groups were sited in the ortho posi- 
tions [e.g. a t-butyl group ortho to the dimethylamino group (28)], which 
impose conformational restriction and thereby reduced mesomeric interaction, 
an increase in basicity results.

1.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Although this is a conformationally mobile system, conformation (29) is 
favoured (more stable) over (30) owing to the 1,3-diaxial interactions arising 
from both the methyl and hydroxyl groups. Note that the change of conforma- 
tions does not affect the configurations at the chiral sites since no bonds are 
cleaved. In the case of cis-2-t-butylcyclohexanol (31), the large t-butyl group 
imposes a favourable bias on the conformation shown even though the hydroxyl 
group is in an axial position. 

Camphor (11), and cholesterol (14), are conformationally rigid, in the former 
case because of the bridged-ring structure, and in the latter because of the all- 
trans ring fusions.

Hence the reactivity of the carbonyl group and of the endo- and exo-hydrogens 
in (11), and the stereochemical consequences of such reactions (i.e. the stereo- 
isomeric nature of the product) are crucially dependent upon the conformation- 
ally fixed environment. Likewise the reactivity of the /^-orientated hydroxyl 
group and of the olefinic bond in cholesterol (14) is determined by the fixed con- 
formational environment. 

It is perhaps only too obvious that the reactivity of one compound offers the 
means of the synthesis of another. In essence, a scheme of synthesis evolves from 
a consideration of structural features, aided by an understanding of reaction 
mechanism, which are applied in the strategy and the methodology of synthesis. 
The strategy of synthesis requires the development of a sequence of ideas as to 
what needs to be done in functional group modification and skeletal structure 
assembly or rearrangement, whereas methodology of synthesis refers to the pro- 
cedures, reagents and conditions which are required to bring about efficient 
reactions in all the intermediate stages of the synthesis. Although current prac- 
tice is to decide on a strategy and then proceed to a consideration of the meth- 
odology to be adopted, the development of ideas in these two areas has 
historically been the reverse, since methodology has contributed to, and been 
vastly extended by, the early development of organic reaction mechanisms. In 
the following discussion the role of methodology is considered first, followed by 
the important contribution of ideas on the strategy of synthesis. 

1.3 REACTION MECHANISM AND THE METHODOLOGY OF 
SYNTHESIS 

Organic reaction mechanisms may be classified into three main groups depend- 
ing on the manner in which the covalent bonds are cleaved, namely: (a) ionic 
mechanisms; (b) radical mechanisms; and (c) pericyclic mechanisms. 

In an ionic mechanism, the bond breaking process (i) in the organic reactant 
is in an overall sense heterolytic. 

10 



ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 1.3 



A— B &gt; A e +:B (i) 

If the rate determining step of the reaction is that in which the reactant donates 
an electron pair to a reagent, the reagent is an electrophile and the overall reac- 
tion is electrophilic. Similarly if the reactant, in the rate determining step of the 
reaction, accepts an electron pair from the reagent, the reagent is a nucleophile 
and the reaction nucleophilic. 

In a radical mechanism, the bond breaking process (ii) in the organic reactant 
is in an overall sense homolytic. 

A— B &gt; A- + -B (ii) 

The reagents in this case are themselves radicals and the subsequent reaction 
sequence frequently involves a chain mechanism. 

In the third group, pericyclic reactions, there are no intermediate ions or 
radicals, but the reactant and reagent orientate themselves so as to form a cyclic 
transition state (usually, but not necessarily, six-membered in type) around 
which there is an 'electron flow' leading to the formation of the new bonding 
arrangement [e.g. (iii)].

(iii) 



These mechanistic possibilities may be sub-classified into the following reac- 
tion types, and since all the reactions described in the text may be assigned a 
mechanism, the forward cross-references are to typical illustrative examples 
only. 

1. Substitution: nucleophilic (e.g. Section 5.5.1, p. 555 and Section 6.8.2, p. 959), 
electrophilic (e.g. Section 6.2.1, p. 851), or radical (e.g. Section 6.3.1, p. 861). 

2. Addition to multiple bonds: nucleophilic (e.g. Section 5.4.2, p. 532), electrophi- 

lic (e.g. Section 5.5.7, p. 574), radical (e.g. Section 5.5.7, p. 575) and pericyclic 
(e.g. Section 7.6). 

3. Elimination: usually nucleophilic (Section 5.2.1, p. 488), but also pericyclic. 

4. Rearrangement: this may be either intra- or inter-molecular, commonly involv- 
ing the migration of a carbon species to a carbon (e.g. Section 5.2.1, p. 487), 
nitrogen (e.g. Section 6.12.6, p. 1047), or oxygen (Section 5.4.3, p. 543) centre. 
The migrating species may be a nucleophile or a radical, or the reaction may 
proceed in a pericyclic fashion. The rearrangement of hydrogen (as a proton 
in prototropy, or in a pericyclic sense) is a widely recognised special case. 

5. Oxidation and reduction. These reactions are mechanistically complementary 
to each other; oxidising reagents (e.g. Section 5.7.1, p. 587) are electrophilic 
and reducing reagents (e.g. Section 5.4.1, p. 519) are nucleophilic. 

Over the past fifty years or more, archetypal cases within each of these reac- 
tion types have been studied in great detail. These extensive studies have enabled 
ideas on the nature and stabilisation of transition states and on the timing of 
bond-breaking and bond-forming processes to be formulated. Many of the re- 
sults have led to modifications in techniques, and to the discovery and design of 
new reactions and reagents, i.e. to the development of the methodology of syn- 
thesis. 

11 



1.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



In this developing framework involving mechanisms and methodology, 
control and selectivity were recognised as playing a crucial and integral role in 
reaction pathways. 

CONTROL AND SELECTIVITY IN ORGANIC REACTIONS 

Most of the reactions described in the synthetic sections of this book give rise to 
only one major product (ignoring the all too frequent presence of by-products 
arising from a variety of spurious reactions; see Section 2.2, calculation of chem- 
ical yield). However, there are many instances where a compound, under a speci- 
fied set of reaction conditions, gives rise to two or more different products. In 
such cases the reaction may proceed under either kinetic or thermodynamic 
control. 

In a reaction under kinetic control, the product composition via transition 
states T.S.I and T.S.2 is determined by the relative rates of the alternative reac- 
tions, which are of course governed by the relative free energies of activation 
(AG*) of the rate determining step of each reaction (Fig. 1.1). Analysis of prod- 
uct composition over the whole time of the reaction will show a constant ratio. 

In some reactions, however, product composition does not remain constant, 
and the ratio of products is significantly different in the early (incomplete) stages 
of the reaction, from that which is found when all the starting material has 
reacted. In this case the reaction is said to be under thermodynamic control, 
where the final ratio of products is determined by their relative thermodynamic 
stabilities (i.e. their free energy differences, AG). Here the products are in equilib- 
rium with either the starting material, or with a common intermediate (as illus- 
trated in Fig. 1.2), so that although the initial product ratio is determined by the 
relative rates of the reactions, the final ratio reflects the relative stabilities of the 
products. Sometimes of course the kinetically controlled product is also the 
more stable, but clearly if this is not the case, attention to detail in specifying 
reaction conditions may enable the preparative isolation of either of the different 
products (see for example Section 5.5.7, p. 574, Section 5.10.1, p. 643 and Section 
6.4.1, p. 874).

ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 1.3 



Aspects of selectivity in reaction pathways may be considered under the 
following topic areas: chemoselectivity, regioselectivity, protection and, finally, 
stereoselectivity. 

In a Afunctional compound, if a reagent reacts with one functional group 
preferentially, even though the other is apparently susceptible to the reaction 
conditions, the reaction is said to be chemoselective. Two illustrative examples 
are: the reduction of a carbonyl group in the presence of a cyano, nitro or 
alkoxycarbonyl group (Section 5.4.1, p. 519; see also Metal hydrides, Section 
4.2.49, p. 445); and the acylation of an aromatic amino group in the presence of a 
phenolic group (Section 6.9.3, p. 984). 

Regioselectivity in a reaction, proceeding without skeletal rearrangements, is 
observed when a molecule possesses two or more sites of reactivity arising from 
the presence of one functional group, each of which the reagent may attack, 
resulting in the formation of constitutional isomers. Preferential formation of 
one of these isomers shows that selection has taken place. In many cases the 
reactivity of the alternative sites may be enhanced by modification of the experi- 
mental conditions. The classical examples are the addition reactions of alkenes 
(Section 5.4.3, p. 542, Section 5.4.4, p. 545 and Section 5.5.7, p. 574), the addition 
reactions of a,/?-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (e.g. direct carbonyl addition 
versus conjugate addition), and the aromatic electrophilic substitution reactions 
leading to either mainly meta products, or ortho/para products (see Section 6.2.1, 
p. 852); it should be noted in the latter case that the ortho/para ratio may also be 
subject to regioselective control. 

Protection could be regarded as a special instance of a combined chemo- and 
regio-selectivity, since it embraces aspects of both. 5g It is implicated when it is 
necessary to carry out a reaction selectively at one functional group, in the pres- 
ence of other functional groups, but where the principles of chemoselectivity are 
not applicable. The accompanying functional groups must therefore be rendered 
inert to the reaction conditions, i.e. they must be protected. The selective intro- 
duction of the protective group must be achieved in good yield, preferably under

mild conditions, the protected compound must be readily purified, and inert to 
the subsequent reaction conditions, and finally the protecting group must be 
easily removed to regenerate the original functionality. The early chemistry of 
carbohydrates (Section 5.10) and amino acids (Section 5.14.4, p. 746) provided a 
sound and substantial foundation from which the application of the principles of 
protection has permeated into all areas of synthesis. 

The term stereoselective is often confused with the term stereospecific, and 
the literature abounds with views as to the most satisfactory definition. To offer 
some clarification, it is perhaps timely to recall a frequently used term, intro- 
duced a decade or so ago, namely the stereoelectronic requirements of a reaction. 
All concerted reactions (i.e. those taking place in a synchronised process of bond 
breaking and bond forming) are considered to have precise spatial requirements 
with regard to the orientation of the reactant and reagent. Common examples 
are Sjv2 displacement reactions (e.g. Section 5.10.4, p. 659), E2 (anti) elimination 
reactions of alkyl halides (e.g. Section 5.2.1, p. 488), syn (pyrolytic) elimination 
reactions (Section 5.2.1, p. 489), trans and cis additions to alkenes (e.g. Section 
5.4.5, p. 547), and many rearrangement reactions. In the case of chiral or geo- 
metric reactants, the stereoisomeric nature of the product is entirely dependent 
on the unique stereoelectronic requirement of the reaction; such reactions are 
stereospecific. 

A stereoselective reaction on the other hand is one in which the stereo- 
electronic requirement of the reaction mechanism is such that two equally valid 
alternative pathways are available for the same mechanistic interaction between 
reactant and reagent. However, either the free energies of activation of the 
alternative reactions or the thermodynamic stabilities of the products differ, so 
that one isomer is formed in preference to the other; selection has occurred. An 
example is provided by the reduction of cholestan-3-one (32). Equatorial attack 
(i) or axial attack (ii) of the hydride ion is mechanistically equally feasible and 
stereoelectronically defined. However, steric interactions between the hydride 
ion source and the conformationally fixed steroid molecule, together with con- 
siderations as to whether the reaction was under kinetic or thermodynamic con- 
trol, would determine that the reaction is proceeding in a stereoselective 
manner. 




A recognition of the concept of stereoselectivity has led the way to a better 
understanding of the selection of reactants and reagents in order to introduce 
chirality into a symmetrical molecule, i.e. an asymmetric synthesis.

ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 1.3 



ASYMMETRIC SYNTHESIS 

This area of synthetic organic chemistry has seen some of the most interesting 
developments over the last decade. The progress may be appreciated from the 
Nobel Symposium 60 on Asymmetric Organic Synthesis 1 ' which highlights the 
(then) current state of the art. Other texts survey the field in general and specific 
areas. 4 "' b - c ' 12 

Before 1940 optically active compounds could only be obtained in stereo- 
isomerically pure form by isolation from natural sources, by resolution of 
racemic mixtures, or by a few laboratory controlled enzymic reactions. Many of 
the chemical reactions described in this book lead to products which contain 
chiral centres, axes, or planes, but in which the isolated material is the optically 
inactive (racemic) form. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the reac- 
tants, reagents, or solvents are achiral or are themselves racemic. The following 
selection of reactions drawn from the text illustrate this statement; they may be 
cross-referenced to the relevant discussion sections, namely: (a) Section 5.4.1, 
p. 519, (b) Section 5.4.3, p. 542, (c) Section 5.11.7, p. 687, (d) Section 8.1.3, 
p. 1133, (e) Section 5.2.4, p. 504 and (/) Section 5.4.2, p. 531.

In order to effect the preferential formation of one stereoisomer (either enan- 
tiomer or diastereoisomer) over the other, either the reactant, or the reagent, or 
the solvent must be the pure enantiomeric form. Three principal categories may 
be recognised and they may be related to the illustrative examples noted above. 

In the first category the reactant is achiral, but either the reagent or the 
solvent is optically pure; the reaction is then said to be enantioselective since one 
enantiomer is formed in preference to the other [e.g. in the reactions (a), (b) and 
(d)l 

In the second category, a functional site adjacent to that at which an asym- 
metric reaction is to be effected is reacted with an optically pure reagent (the 
chiral auxiliary or chiral adjuvant) to give an optically pure modified reactant. In 
the subsequent reaction to form the new chiral site, two diastereoisomers would 
be formed in unequal proportions (the reaction is then said to be diastereo- 
selective). When the chiral auxiliary is then subsequently removed, one of the 
enantiomers would be present in a greater proportion [e.g. (c), where the optic- 
ally pure auxiliary reacts with the carboxyl group, and the subsequent reaction 
is controlled by the chirality of the auxiliary]. A further point to note is that fre- 
quently the mixture of diastereoisomers may be separated readily by one of the 
latest chromatographic techniques (Section 2.31), in which case removal of the 
auxiliary leads to the isolation of the pure enantiomers. 

15 



1.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



In the third category the reactant is itself optically pure, and the site of chiral- 
ity is adjacent to the site of the reaction. It is the chirality of this site which in- 
fluences the stereoisomeric course of the reaction (diastereoselection) which 
then gives rise to two diastereoisomers in unequal proportions. For example in 
if), if the aldehyde was (/?)-Ph(Me)CH-CHO and the Grignard reagent 
MeMgX, the diastereoisomeric product pair, in unequal proportions, would be 
(2/?,3/?)-3-phenylbutan-2-ol and (2S,3/?)-3-phenylbutan-2-ol as illustrated 
below. If the (S)-aldehyde had been used the diastereoisomeric pair would be 
(2S,3S) and (2/?,3S).

Case (e) is interesting because the chirality of the site, coupled with the stereo- 
specific nature of the reaction (Section 5.2.4, p. 504) determines the chirality of 
the allene which has of course a chiral axis (i.e. the chirality of the chiral site has 
determined the chirality of the chiral axis). 

In all these cases, provided that the reaction is under kinetic control, the pro- 
portion of predominant isomer found in the product (whether enantiomeric or 
diastereoisomeric) is determined by the difference in the free energies of activa- 
tion of the irreversible steps leading to the alternative diastereoisomeric transi- 
tion states. In each of the cases noted above, the text gives some amplification of 
the factors which determine these differences in free energy of activation and, it is 
hoped, should provide an introduction to the philosophy of asymmetric syn- 
thesis. However, a few further general comments may be helpful. 

1. It is often helpful to construct models of the reactant and the reagent as a 
pointer to the stability of the different conformations resulting from intramo- 
lecular non-bonded interactions. In particular any internal chelation effects 
existing in the reagent or reactant, or which might develop during the course 
of the reaction need to be identified. 

2. As detailed a knowledge as possible should be acquired of the mechanism of 
the reaction, particularly in relation to the direction of approach of the 
reagent to the reactant. For example, in an addition reaction to a carbonyl 
group, the most (energetically) favourable line of attack of the nucleophilic 
species (Nu) is at right angles to the plane of the er-bond structure, and at 
angle of approximately 109° to the axis of the C — O er-bond as illustrated 
below; the enantiotopic faces (i.e. the re-face or the si-face in R'-CO-R 2 ) or 
the diastereotopic faces (i.e. the re-face or the si-face in the carbonyl group of 
R'R 2 CHCOR 3 ) should be recognised.

In the case of a methylene group, in for example the ketone Ph-COCH 2 *Me,

3. All the mechanistically acceptable alternative modes of approach of the 
reactant (or some reactive intermediate derived from it by a preliminary 
reaction) and the reagent should be considered, with a qualitative assess- 
ment of the interactions that would develop. In the case of steric inter- 
actions, it is convenient to remember that in the case of a reactant having a 
large (L) and a small (S) group, coming into close proximity to a reagent 
which also has a large (L') and a small (S') group, the more effective 'pack- 
ing', i.e. more stable transition state, is (L to S') + (S to L') rather than (L to 
L') + (S to S'). (An analogy which has been used here is the instance of the 
packing of a mixture of large and small balls into a box; more effective pack- 
ing results from alternate size layers.) Another factor worth noting is 
whether, in one diastereoisomeric transition state, there is a substituent 
group in either reactant or reagent which fits into a vacant space in the 
other, whereas in the alternative diastereoisomeric transition state, severe 
interactions are present. 

4. In some cases, and this is particularly noticeable in reactions involving sites in 
cyclic systems, the stereoisomeric result appears not to be controlled by the 
steric interactions discussed under (3) (i.e. steric -approach control), but by 
the stability of the product (product -development control). In these cases the 
ratio of products enables an assessment to be made of the timing of the bond- 
breaking and bond-forming processes. Thus in steric -approach control, the 
transition state (i.e. the energy maximum in the energy profile of the reaction) 
is reactant-like, and bond-breaking and bond-forming processes are only in 
their initial stages. In product-development control the transition state is now 
at an advanced state of bond breaking and bond forming (i.e. the transition 
state is product-like). 

There is now an extensive methodology of asymmetric synthesis intended 
to achieve the ultimate aim, so effectively realised in nature, of 100 per cent 
enantiomeric or diastereoisomeric excess. Indeed any new method or new 
reagent which does not achieve at least 50 per cent excess is now rarely re- 
ported. It might be confidently anticipated that many more elegant reactions 
and reagents will emerge in the coming decade, illustrating the manner in 
which mechanism and methodology are intimately interwoven. 

1.4 REACTION MECHANISM AND THE STRATEGY OF SYNTHESIS 

It has been pointed out already that the early design of synthetic routes for the 
vast number of simple and complex molecules was a largely intuitive operation. 
Indeed even the most eminent of synthetic chemists rarely recorded in the litera- 
ture the thought processes which led to the realisation of the successful synthesis 
of a complex structure. One notable exception was that of the Robinson tropi- 
none synthesis. 13 In this case the molecule was submitted to an 'imaginary 
hydrolysis' at the points indicated by the dotted line and 'resolved' into succin- 
dialdehyde, methylamine and acetone. These reagents were then mixed together 

17 



1.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



under conditions which could reasonably mimic those pertaining to a bio- 
chemical synthesis, resulting in a low yield of product; the yield was improved to 
an acceptable level by using acetone dicarboxylate in place of acetone. This was 
probably the first example of a target molecule (TM) being transformed into syn- 
thetic precursors by a retrosynthetic strategy (designated by the symbol =&gt;), 
although not described in these terms.

The possibility of using computers in the derivation of synthetic routes 
was first explored by E. J. Corey 14 following his review of the general phil- 
osophy and the methods which were then currently adopted in the synthesis of 
both simple and complex molecules. 15 Since that time, major computer 
programs have been devised to assist organic chemists in analysing the 
strategy of synthesis and selecting the most viable synthetic route to a target 
molecule. 

A review on recent developments classifies these programs into two main 
categories, the 'passive' programs and the 'active' programs. 16 

The passive programs are in effect computerised libraries, one group of which 
can locate all compounds that contain a specified sub-structure or a stereo- 
isomeric arrangement in a given database. 17 A second group relates to 
reaction-type retrieval programs from databases compiled from Organic Syn- 
theses, from Theilheimers Synthetic Methods of Organic Chemistry, or from ex- 
tensive chemical literature sources. 18 

The major active programs have some similarity between themselves in that 
most are retrosynthetic and each breaks the target molecule down into synthetic 
precursor units. These in turn are similarly 'degraded', via retrosynthetic steps, 
to readily available starting materials. In achieving these aims two different 
approaches have been adopted, and useful summaries have been published. 19 A 
third approach has a rather different philosophy since the program operates in a 
synthetic rather than a retrosynthetic mode. 

In the first approach 20 the programs are highly interactive with the user, and 
intercommunication is achieved via graphical input (stylus and magnetic tablet) 
and graphical display. In this way the user draws the target molecule and the 
computer then identifies the structural features, for example the functional 
groups, the presence of isolated saturated or aromatic rings, fused- and bridged- 
ring systems, the nature of stereoisomeric and conformational features, etc. A 
menu is then displayed of the three major strategies, namely: (a) group-oriented, 
(b) bond-oriented, or (c) long-range strategies, from which a selection is made by 
the user. 

(a) The group-oriented strategy involves functional group interconversion 
(FGI), functional group addition (FGA), functional group removal (FGR), 
and the unmasking of (latent) functional groups by deprotection or other 
conversions. 

(b) The bond-oriented strategy centres attention on the disconnection of bonds 
in ring systems (bridged or fused), and bonds joining ring atoms to func- 
tional groups or other residues. 



ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 1.4 



(c) The long-range strategies encompass those retrosynthetic reactions which 
result in significant simplification of structure, for example, the Robinson 
annelation reaction, the Birch reduction, the Diels-Alder reaction, etc. 

The selection from this menu is satisfying to the user as it uses intuitive chem- 
ical knowledge, but with the option of rejection should the first level of simplifi- 
cation in the retrosynthetic sequence suggested prove to be unpromising. 
Having selected the first level precursors, each precursor is then treated as a 
'target molecule' and processed appropriately. The program then evaluates the 
overall route selected and recommends reagents, reaction conditions, and sug- 
gests possible reaction mechanisms. 

The second approach 21 is different in that the programs are not interactive, 
and are based more upon theoretical considerations. Here the skeletal structure 
of the target molecule is cleaved into the smallest number of skeletal fragments 
which can then be related to the c. 5000 readily available starting materials. The 
program then generates functionality in the skeletal fragments which can lead to 
consecutive connective constructions from such starting materials based on 
broad mechanistic principles. Although the programs are capable of suggesting 
new chemistry and previously unrealised synthetic routes, they do tend to pro- 
vide a great number of potential precursors and being non-interactive, they re- 
quire the use of self-limiting guides to ensure chemical viability of the selected 
synthetic routes. 

In the third approach, 22 the programs operate in the synthetic, rather than 
the retrosynthetic, mode from a database of reaction mechanisms. As such they 
usefully complement the programs of the previous two groups, offering an 
answer to the hypothetical question 'if compound Y is subjected to the reaction 
conditions Z would X, or some other alternative structure, be formed?'. 

All of the major chemical companies involved in organic chemical synthesis 
have access to these programs, and many academic organic research groups util- 
ise these facilities. For undergraduates, the value of the use of computers in 
organic synthesis is that, for the first time, it is possible to acquire experience in 
the logic of organic synthetic design. Thus the principles of a retrosynthetic anal- 
ysis of a target molecule, and the selection (based on sound mechanistic ideas) of 
the most appropriate synthetic route generated, may be applied without the use 
of a computer. Hence when the graduate becomes exposed to the computer syn- 
thetic programs, familiarity with the concept of logic in synthesis, coupled with a 
better understanding of the factors which are important in deciding between 
alternative routes, will enable a transition into new and unfamiliar synthetic 
problems to be possible. 

The principal exponent of the non-computerised approach to retrosynthetic 
analysis in organic synthesis, and which finds its origin in the early work of E. J. 
Corey, is S. Warren. 5cd A useful shorter account is to be found in the writings of 
J. Fuhrhop and G. Penzlin. 5e The non-computerised retrosynthetic analysis has 
also been termed the synthon approach, a term which was first introduced and 
denned by E. J. Corey. ' 5 

A synthon may be denned as a structural unit which becomes an idealised 
fragment as a result of disconnection of a carbon-carbon or carbon heteroatom 
bond in a retrosynthetic step (transform). Thus it may be envisaged in general 
terms, that an open-chain structure in a single disconnection step would give rise 
to two synthons; two synthons would also arise in a similar disconnection of a 

19 



1.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



bond joining a group to a cyclic structure. The disconnection of a bond within a 
monocylcic system would be a retrosynthetic ring-opening process; the discon- 
nection of a bond in a bridged structure would give rise to a mono- or disubsti- 
tuted monocyclic structure. Simultaneous two-bond disconnections may also be 
possible. 

Synthons resulting from single bond disconnections may be ions (cationic or 
anionic) or radicals according to whether the bond cleavage is heterolytic or 
homolytic. Usually they are not in themselves reagents, but have to be related to 
suitable reactants which under appropriate conditions will interact to effect the 
reverse, synthetic, step. Synthons which are neutral molecules can result from 
two simultaneous single bond disconnections occurring in a pericyclic manner. 
The examples which follow are a few illustrative carbon-carbon and carbon- 
heteroatom disconnections which produce either charged or radical species, or 
neutral molecules. For a more extensive range of examples the reader's attention 
is directed to the summaries of retrosynthetic strategies included in the introduc- 
tion to most of the aliphatic and aromatic functional compounds.

The reagents corresponding to the charged species may be deduced by con- 
sulting Tables A6.1 and A6.2 in Appendix 6. These tables give lists of commonly 
encountered synthons generated by heterolytic fission and their most important 
reagent equivalents, together with a cross-reference to those sections of the text 
which discuss the process in a little more detail. 

It should be noted that the nature of the charge on the various synthons 
shown above corresponds to what would have been expected on the basis of 
electronegativity, or of inductive or mesomeric stabilisation effects. Not infre- 
quently, however, a disconnection generates a synthon in which the polarity is 

not what would have been expected on the above grounds; some examples are 

e © 

R e , R-C=0, CH 2 -C0 2 R. These synthons have 'unnatural', or 'reversed' polar- 
ity (originally called 'umpolung'). 23 However, they are perfectly valid though 
their reagent equivalents are sometimes not immediately obvious. Some illus- 
trative examples are noted below. 

1. The alkyl anion (R e ) is the simplest example, and it has long been known as 

6- d + 

the reactive species generated from a Grignard reagent (R — MgX), and other 

related organometallic compounds (see Section 5.4.2, p. 531). 
e 

2. The acyl anion (R-C=0) is not stable as such, but when an aldehyde is con- 
verted into a 1,3-dithiane by reaction with propane- 1,3-dithiol and then 
treated with base, it forms an acyl anion equivalent, and hence is susceptible to 
attack by electrophilic reagents (see Section 5.9). Two extensive compilations 
of formyl and acyl anion synthons together with references to their reactions 

with electrophiles have been published. 24 
© 

3. The cation (CH 2 -COR) would arise from an a-halo ketone owing to the good 

leaving properties of the halogen. In a similar way the a-halo ester, 

© 
BrCH 2 -C0 2 Et, is a reagent equivalent for the cation, CH 2 'C0 2 Et, but in the 

presence of zinc dust it forms the organometallic reagent, BrZnCH 2 -C0 2 Et, 

e 
which is the reagent equivalent for the anion, CH 2 -C0 2 Et (see Section 5.14.2, 
p. 727). 

4. The carbon-carbon double bond is attacked by electrophilic reagents; how- 
ever after conversion to the epoxide the carbons are susceptible to nucleo- 
philic attack, i.e. the donor qualities of the carbons are changed to acceptor 
qualities (Section 5.4.5, p. 547 and Section 5.18.1, p. 795). 

Having considered the broad principles of bond disconnection, and the 
charged nature of the derived synthons, attention must now be turned to a con- 

21 



1.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



sideration of the selection of the bond to be cleaved. The forward references 
noted below enable appropriate examples to be found in the text. 

If the target molecule is monofunctional, the disconnection process is classi- 
fied as a one-group disconnection. The bond initially considered for cleavage 
would be, if present, the a-carbon-heteroatom single bond (i.e. the C — O, C — X, 
C — N, C — S bonds) as would be found in, for example, alcohols (Section 5.4), 
alkyl halides (Section 5.5), ethers (Section 5.6), nitroalkanes (Section 5.15), 
amines (Section 5.16), thiols and thioethers (Section 5.17). 

If the functional group is a carbon species [i.e. — C=C — , — CsN, — CHO, 
— COR, — C0 2 H(R)], then a possible disconnection point would be the bond 
uniting the a-carbon to the functional group carbon, as is found with alkynes 
(Section 5.3), aldehydes (Section 5.7), ketones (Section 5.8), carboxylic acids 
(Section 5.11) or their derived esters (Section 5.12.3, p. 695). Alternative discon- 
nection points which would be worth considering are the a, /?- and /?, y-carbon 
bonds, in for example aldehydes or ketones. 

If the target molecule is an acyclic or an alicyclic bifunctional compound in 
which the functional groups are in a 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-, 1,5-, etc., relationship, then 
the disconnection is termed a two-group disconnection and specifically refers to a 
cleavage of any of the carbon-carbon single bonds which lie between the two 
functional groups. The examples given in dicarbonyl compounds (Section 5.9), 
dicarboxylic acids (Section 5.11), keto acids and esters (Section 5.14.3, p. 735), 
some of the alicyclic (Ch. 7) and heterocyclic (Ch. 8) compounds, all illustrate 
the value of retrosynthetic analysis, and the derivation of reagent equivalents. 
The problem of protection of functional groups in either or both of the synthon 
entities may well need to be considered in the strategy of synthesis of poly- 
functional compounds. 

If the target molecule is an aromatic or heteroaromatic compound, in which 
the ring system is found in readily available starting materials (e.g. benzene, 
pyridine, etc.), disconnection at the bond uniting the ring with the substituent is 
the most obvious point of cleavage [see for example aromatic nitro compounds 
(Section 6.2), or aromatic aldehydes (Section 6.10)]. Here of course, with poly- 
functional compounds, it would be the order in which the substituents were 
introduced that would be crucial to the synthetic strategy, owing to the directive 
effects of groups (i.e. the regioselectivity of the individual synthetic steps). 

Target molecules which contain a carbon-carbon double bond, in the pres- 
ence of other functionality or not, may be treated as in a one- or two-group dis- 
connection strategy, as noted above. However, disconnection at the double 
bond may be a valuable retrosynthetic transform, since the synthons may then 
be related to reagent equivalents for a Wittig-type (Section 5.2.3, p. 495 and 
Section 5.18) or aldol-type (Section 5.18) synthesis. 

It should be pointed out that S. Warren 5cd has introduced a 'nomenclature' 
system for one- and two-group disconnections and for fission at a carbon- 
carbon double bond. These are valuable when communicating the essence of a 
retrosynthetic strategy in the analysis of complex target structures. 

Pericyclic disconnections and sigmatropic and other rearrangements give rise 
to synthons which are themselves reagents. Such disconnections greatly simplify 
the target molecule (e.g. the refro-Diels-Alder reaction). These disconnections 
are most commonly applied in alicyclic and heterocyclic systems. 

Finally, the target molecule should be inspected for the possibility of effecting 
a reconnection transform. A common example is where a target molecule has 



22 



ORGANIC SYNTHESIS 1.5 



two carbonyl groups (aldehydic or ketonic) sited in a 1,5- (or higher) relation- 
ship. In such a case the retrosynthetic step is the formation of a carbon-carbon 
double bond between the carbonyl carbons; the synthetic step would be the 
cleavage of the double bond by ozonolysis or related methods (e.g. Section 5.7.3, 
p. 593). 

For the undergraduate student, an introduction to the synthon approach is 
most conveniently explored with acyclic, simple alicyclic and heterocyclic, and 
aromatic compounds. In each of these groups the presence of polyfunctionality 
provides increasing experience in the recognition of the way in which a target 
molecule may be transformed into synthons. Such explorations provide greater 
knowledge of functional group manipulation, a realisation of the methods of 
protection which may be necessary, the ordering of operations in the forward 
synthetic direction, the problems associated with chemoselectivity, regio- 
selectivity and stereoselectivity, and the mechanistic principles upon which the 
integration of the methodology and strategy of synthesis depends. 



1.5 CONCLUSION 

This chapter commenced with a review of the numerous theoretical and prac- 
tical aspects with which the prospective organic chemist would need to become 
familiar. The major preparative sections of the book, in amplifying the topics 
which have been covered briefly in this chapter, will serve to stimulate further 
thought and provide useful, reliable, and interesting syntheses in which experi- 
ence in preparative techniques, purification procedures, and spectroscopic 
characterisation may be acquired. The question which was posed at an early 
stage in this chapter was 'how may compound X be synthesised?'. It is hoped 
that undergraduates will apply this question to most of the compounds that they 
encounter, for the solution of these separate riddles, which with many com- 
pounds may be checked in the literature, should provide confidence in the 
approach to the more 'difficult' syntheses encountered in later career.

CHAPTER 2 

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 



2.1 GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR SAFE WORKING IN ORGANIC 
CHEMICAL LABORATORIES 

INTRODUCTION 

Chemistry laboratories need not be dangerous places in which to work, despite 
the many potential hazards associated with them, provided that certain element- 
ary precautions are taken and that all workers conduct themselves with 
common sense and alertness. 

There will almost invariably be a senior person assigned to be in charge of a 
chemical laboratory, irrespective of the nature of the work to be done there. 
However, it must be emphasised that the exercise of care and the adoption of 
safe working procedures is the responsibility of each and every person in that 
laboratory. If there is any doubt as to the safety of a proposed experiment, 
advice should be sought from an experienced person rather than just hoping for 
the best. 

All workers must adopt a responsible attitude to their work and avoid any 
thoughtless, ignorant or hurried behaviour which may lead to an accident and 
possible harm to themselves or to others. They should always pay attention to 
what is going on around them and be aware of the possible dangers arising from 
the work of others as well as from their own experiments. 

Laboratory accidents are often caused by attempts to obtain results in too 
great a hurry. Laboratory workers must therefore adopt a thoughtful, careful 
and methodical approach to what they are doing. In particular, concentration 
on the job in hand and not allowing the attention to be distracted must be par- 
ticularly commended. Similarly the unnecessary distraction of others is to be de- 
plored. In routine experiments and operations, it is important to remember the 
truth of the old adage 'familiarity breeds contempt' and to be on one's guard 
against the feeling that 'it cannot happen to me'. 

PERSONAL PROTECTION 

No worker should be allowed in a laboratory without a full-length protective 
coat, preferably white, since spillages and stains are then more readily detected. 
Furthermore, all personnel, including visitors, must wear safety spectacles or 
goggles at all times. There are several good lightweight goggles and spectacles 
available from laboratory suppliers which provide, in routine use, good cover- 
age of the eyes and upper face; many designs are suitable for use over prescrip- 

26 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.1 



tion glasses. Prescription safety glasses are of course readily available through 
specialised sources, and although more expensive, would be appropriate to the 
full-time laboratory worker. Although contact lenses give some protection 
against mechanical damage to the eye, the wearing of protective spectacles is still 
essential. It should be noted however that in the event of an accident, these con- 
ventional safety spectacles provide varying degrees of protection against flying 
fragments, but often very little protection against the splashing or spraying of 
hot, corrosive or toxic liquids and gases. In the event of chemical splashes, first- 
aid should be confined to thorough irrigation of the eyes with clean water. Con- 
tact lenses may restrict effective irrigation and their removal should be 
undertaken only by qualified medical staff. Close-fitting safety goggles or, 
preferably, a visor covering the whole face afford a much greater measure of pro- 
tection in these circumstances. Whenever experiments or operations that are 
suspected as being hazardous are being carried out, the additional protection of 
safety screens is strongly advised. In any case all experiments involving toxic 
reagents or solvents must be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard, and dis- 
posable plastic gloves should be carefully inspected to ensure that they are free 
from pinholes. 

CONDUCT IN THE LABORATORY 

Except in an emergency, running, or any over-hurried activity, should be forbid- 
den in and around the laboratories, as should be practical jokes or other irres- 
ponsible behaviour. Eating, drinking and smoking in the laboratory should also 
be forbidden; these constitute a further, avoidable, risk of the ingestion of toxic 
substances, and in the case of smoking an obvious fire hazard. 

TIDINESS AND CLEANLINESS 

Coupled with a general consideration for the safety of others, tidiness is a major 
factor in laboratory safety; the laboratory must be kept clean and tidy at all 
times. Passageways between and around the benches and near exits must not be 
blocked with equipment or furniture. Floors must be kept in good condition to 
prevent slipping or tripping, i.e. they must be kept free from oil or water, and 
from any protrusion. Any spillage on a floor or bench should be cleaned up im- 
mediately. 

Some indication of a chemist's practical ability is apparent from the appear- 
ance of the working bench. This should always be kept clean and dry; this is 
easily done if suitable wet and dry rags are kept at hand. Apparatus not immedi- 
ately required should be kept as far as possible in a cupboard beneath the bench; 
if it must be placed on the bench, it should be arranged in a neat and orderly 
manner. Dirty apparatus can be placed in a plastic bowl away from the working 
area until it can be cleaned and put away. Solid waste and filter papers must not 
be thrown in the sink. 

All glassware should be scrupulously clean and, for most purposes, dry before 
being employed in preparative work in the laboratory. The use of rigorously 
dried apparatus for reactions involving highly moisture-sensitive compounds is 
described in Section 2.17.8, p. 126. It is advisable to develop the habit of cleaning 
all glass apparatus immediately after use as the nature of the contaminant will, 
in general, be known. Furthermore, the cleaning process becomes more difficult 
if the dirty apparatus is allowed to stand for a considerable period, particularly if 
volatile solvents have evaporated in the meantime. 

27 



2.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



It must be emphasised that there is no universal cleaning mixture. The 
chemist must take into account the nature of the substance to be removed and 
the amount of deposit, and act accordingly. Thus if the residue in the flask is 
known to be basic in character, dilute hydrochloric or sulphuric acid may dis- 
solve it completely; similarly, dilute sodium hydroxide solution may be 
employed for acidic residues. In these instances the acidic or basic aqueous solu- 
tion may be washed down the drain with liberal quantities of water. If the 
residue is known to dissolve in an inexpensive organic solvent, this should be 
employed; in such a case the solution must be poured into the appropriate 
'residues' bottle, not down the sink. Solvent suitable specifically for cleaning use 
may be recovered by distilling accumulated residues. Remaining heavily con- 
taminated material should be suitably disposed of (Section 2.1, p. 30). 

The simplest method for gross deposits, when access by a test-tube brush is 
possible, is to employ a commercial household washing powder containing an 
abrasive which does not scratch glass (e.g. 'Vim', 'Ajax', etc.). The washing 
powder is either introduced directly into the apparatus and moistened with a 
little water or else it may be applied to the dirty surface with a test-tube brush 
which has been dipped into the powder; the glass surface is then scrubbed until 
the dirt has been removed. The operation should be repeated if necessary. 
Finally, the apparatus is thoroughly rinsed with distilled water. If scrubbing 
with the water-washing powder mixture is not entirely satisfactory, the powder 
may be moistened with an organic solvent, such as acetone. 

Three alternative cleaning solutions are worth a trial if the above methods 
fail: 

1. A warm 15 per cent trisodium phosphate solution to which a little abrasive 
powder, such as pumice, has been added; this reagent is not suitable for the 
removal of tarry residues. 

2. The highly effective surface active agent, Decon 90, which is claimed to be suit- 

able for virtually all laboratory cleaning applications. It is totally rinsable, 
phosphate free, biodegradable and non-toxic. It is particularly suitable for 
silicone oils, greases, polymeric residues and tars. 

3. The 'chromic acid' cleaning mixture. This is essentially a mixture of chromium 

trioxide (for precautions in its use see Section 2.3.2, p. 37) and concentrated 
sulphuric acid, and possesses powerful oxidising and solvent properties. A 
convenient method of preparation is as follows. Five grams of sodium dichro- 
mate are dissolved in 5 ml of water in a 250 ml beaker; 1 00 ml of concentrated 
sulphuric acid are then added slowly with constant stirring. The temperature 
will rise to 70-80 °C. The mixture is allowed to cool to about 40 °C and then 
transferred to a dry, glass-stoppered, clearly labelled, bottle. Before using this 
mixture for cleaning purposes, the vessel to be cleaned should be rinsed with 
water to remove water-soluble organic matter, and particularly reducing 
agents, as far as possible. After draining away as much of the water as is prac- 
ticable, a quantity of the cleaning mixture is introduced into the vessel, the 
soiled surface thoroughly wetted with the mixture, and the main quantity of 
the cleaning mixture returned to the stock bottle. After standing for a short 
time with occasional rotation of the vessel to spread the liquid over the sur- 
face, the vessel is thoroughly rinsed successively with tap and distilled water. 

The use of any of the above methods, as detailed, may be regarded as safe and 
satisfactory for the removal of gross residues; no other chemical treatment should 

28 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.1 



be attempted owing to the possibility of explosion hazard. The final removal of 
trace residues is most effectively accomplished by the ultrasonic bath. The tanks 
for laboratory use have capacities from 2.7 to 85 litres; the tank fluid is usually 
Decon 90. Vessels containing gross residues should not be cleaned in these baths 
as the fluid will rapidly become greatly contaminated and its efficiency will be 
diminished. A further advantage of these baths is their ability to free ground- 
glass joints when these have become 'fused' by degraded chemical contaminants. 
After cleaning and rinsing with distilled water, small glass apparatus may be 
dried by leaving it in an electrically heated oven maintained at 100-120°C for 
about 1 hour. However, much organic apparatus is too bulky for oven drying 
and, moreover, is generally required soon after washing; other methods of dry- 
ing are therefore used. If the apparatus is wet with water, the latter is drained as 
completely as possible, then rinsed with a little industrial spirit or acetone. For 
reasons of economy, the wet industrial spirit or acetone should be collected in 
suitably labelled Winchester bottles for future recovery by distillation and 
re-use. After rinsing with the organic solvent, the subsequent drying is more con- 
veniently done by means of a warm air blower (available, for example, from 
Gallenkamp). It consists of a power driven blower which draws air through a 
filter, passes it through a heater, and forces it through upward pointing tubes 
which support the apparatus, and which are specially constructed to accom- 
modate flasks and cylinders having narrow necks which make other means of 
drying difficult; each apparatus support tube has a number of holes at its end to 
ensure good distribution of heated air. Cold air may be circulated if required. 

ACCIDENT PROCEDURE 

Every person working in a laboratory should ensure that he or she knows where 
the exits and fire escapes are situated and that there is free access to them. All 
workers should also note the positions of fire extinguishers, fire blankets and 
drench showers, and make sure that they know how to use them. The checking 
of such equipment should be carried out by the proper authorities at regular in- 
tervals. The worker should also be familiar with the location of the first-aid 
equipment provided for emergency use, and the position of the nearest tele- 
phone; the numbers of the appropriate medical teams, hospitals and fire 
brigades should be displayed in a prominent position. In addition to the above 
general common-sense approach to accidents, individual industrial, research, 
and teaching establishments publish accident procedure regulations to meet 
their own specific requirements; every worker must be fully conversant with 
such regulations. 

AFTER-HOURS WORKING 

No person should ever work alone in a laboratory. Experiments which must be 
left running overnight are best sited in a specially constructed overnight room 
(see Section 2.16), but if this is not possible, the precautions recommended in 
Section 2.16 should be adopted and the apparatus labelled clearly as to the 
nature of the reaction and the likely hazards. Clear instructions must be left so 
that an unqualified person can terminate the experiment in an emergency. 
'Please leave on' notices should be left alongside any service which is to be left 
running (water, electricity). Here again individual establishments publish spe- 
cific regulations relating to after-hours working and overnight experiments, and 
these must be strictly adhered to.

2.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



STORAGE OF CHEMICALS IN LABORATORY AREAS 

Chemicals should never be allowed to accumulate on benches or in fume cup- 
boards, but should always be returned to their proper places on robust storage 
shelves; incompatible chemicals should be separated from one another. Heavy 
containers and bottles of dangerous chemicals should be returned as soon as 
possible to the main chemical store where specific regulations for safe storage 
apply. Strict regulations also apply to the quantity of solvents that may be 
stored in a specific laboratory; furthermore such solvents must be stored in a 
fire-proof steel cabinet fitted with a vapour-seal door, and an area must be 
assigned and properly equipped for the safe dispensing of flammable and toxic 
solvents. Any Winchester bottle, whether containing dangerous or innocuous 
chemicals, that needs to be carried a short distance, should be supported at the 
base and at the neck - never at only one of these points. For longer distances the 
special carriers which are available should be used. 

Fume cupboards must be kept free from surplus chemicals and discarded 
apparatus. If stocks of noxious chemicals which are in frequent use have to be 
stored in a fume cupboard they should all be assigned to one which is set aside 
for this purpose and is properly fitted with shelving. Chemicals which are 
carcinogenic, but the use of which is permitted, are always retained in a main 
store in specially provided sealed cabinets; definitive authorisation is required 
for their use. 

All containers (bottles, ampoules, vials, etc.) of chemicals purchased commer- 
cially bear a clear label indicating the nature of the contents, and a hazard sym- 
bol, together with risk and safety summaries specifying the possible danger 
associated with the contents. Appendix 5 gives a list of the more important regu- 
latory European Economic Community (EEC) hazard symbols. Charts sum- 
marising the meaning of these symbols should be placed prominently in every 
laboratory. When chemicals are transferred to another container the same 
hazard code must be placed on the new container. In the case of vessels which 
have lost their labels, the contents should be positively identified and the con- 
tainer relabelled; should there be any doubt, the material should be disposed of 
safely. Since gummed labels readily dry out and drop off, it is a good idea to seal 
them to the vessel with transparent adhesive tape. Since many chemicals deteri- 
orate with age, it is also a good idea to write the date on the label when the bottle 
arrives from the distributor. 

GLASSWARE 

Glass apparatus should be carefully examined before use and any which is 
cracked, chipped, flawed or dirty should be rejected. Minute cracks in glassware 
for use in evacuated systems are particularly dangerous. 

Many apparently simple manipulations such as the cutting of glass tubing or 
rod, the insertion of glass tubing or thermometers into rubber bungs or bark 
corks, or the removal of tight stoppers from bottles, can lead to serious cuts. 
Care should be taken to adopt the correct procedures (Sections 2.9 and 2. 10). All 
apparatus and clean glassware not in use should be stored away and not allowed 
to accumulate on benches. 

WASTE DISPOSAL 

This is one of the most important but difficult aspects of laboratory use and 
management. Waste material must never be allowed to accumulate in the 

30 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.2 



laboratory; it should be removed regularly from the laboratory area for storage 
in suitable containers so that it can be disposed of appropriately. There should 
be separate bins with properly fitting lids for broken glassware and for flam- 
mable materials such as paper or cloths which may have been used to mop up 
flammable liquids. Innocuous waste solids should be placed in bins provided, 
toxic solids should be sealed in a plastic bag and placed in a separate bin; both 
bins should be clearly labelled. Waste solvents should be placed in suitable con- 
tainers and appropriately labelled, but indiscriminate mixing of solvents must be 
avoided. Halogenated solvents in particular should be kept apart from other sol- 
vents. 

Most large laboratory complexes will have arrangements by which the accu- 
mulated waste material is disposed of appropriately; they may for example have 
facilities for the combustion of quantities of flammable organic material. Smaller 
establishments however may have to rely on the services of specialised contrac- 
tors. The problems associated with the disposal of small quantities of toxic or 
hazardous unwanted chemicals can be lessened by the individual laboratory 
worker taking intelligent action. Guidelines for suitable disposal methods have 
been comprehensively dealt with in, for example, the Aldrich Catalogue of Fine 
Chemicals. Local regulations relating to the disposal of chemicals down the 
main drains are stringent: under no circumstances should untreated wastes and 
water-insoluble organic solvents be thrown down the sink. 



2.2 PLANNING OF EXPERIMENTS AND RECORDING OF RESULTS 

LEVELS OF RESPONSIBILITY IN EXPERIMENT PLANNING 

Before commencing work in the laboratory, sound planning of the experiment 
to be undertaken is essential. The detail of such planning, and the level of per- 
sonal responsibility involved by the laboratory worker, depends on the degree of 
expertise that has been previously acquired. Three levels of experience may be 
recognised for the user of this book, although it should be realised that the tran- 
sition between them is a continuous process. 

Junior technical staff and students in sub-degree and first-year undergraduate 
courses need considerable guidance, for their own safety, and for that of other 
users of the laboratory. Experiments are selected in a sequence by supervisory 
staff to ensure increasing experimental competence and confidence. Glassware 
and other apparatus for the specific experiment are usually provided from a cen- 
tral source, the authenticity of reagents and solvents is checked by technical 
staff, hazards (which should be minimal at this stage) are clearly delineated, and 
the instruction sheets or experimental details by means of a book page reference 
should be clear, detailed and unambiguous. Frequently a short list of questions 
relating to the experiment is provided to reinforce the understanding of the prac- 
tical and theoretical aspects of the experiment. In these circumstances experi- 
ment planning requires that the worker should carefully study the complete 
details and advice provided, and form a clear idea of what is to be done and pre- 
cisely how it is proposed to do it. 

At a second stage the student or technician accepts more responsibility in the 
experiment planning. Thus although instruction sheets (or book references) are 
suitably detailed, a level of technical competence in routine operations acquired 
from earlier work is now expected. Furthermore, the assembly of apparatus, the 

31 



2.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



verification of starting material authenticity [by spectroscopic or chromato- 
graphic methods, or by physical means (m.p., [a]' A , etc.)], the assessment of 
hazards from the instruction sheets and from other sources, the safe disposal of 
reaction residues, the decision as to which techniques are required for the verifi- 
cation of product purity, and finally the timing of the operations within the 
period(s) available (including if necessary the planning of overnight operations), 
all require decision by the worker. Usually senior staff, in discussion with the 
junior worker, assess the soundness of the proposed plan before it is put into 
operation. The student should regard the verification of starting material auth- 
enticity as most valuable experience; time and effort will not then be wasted in 
the not unknown event of mistaken identity, and also it provides an opportunity 
to acquire a personal 'library' of spectroscopic, chromatographic and other 
reference data. 

The third (but not of course the last) stage of increasing expertise, usually re- 
quires the planning of experiments which involve the use of advanced techniques 
or equipment, and the planning of 'open-ended' experiments and undergraduate 
projects leading to postgraduate-type work. In addition to the responsibilities 
outlined at the two earlier stages, it now becomes necessary for the worker to 
check the availability and cost of reagents and solvents, to relate this knowledge 
to alternative synthetic procedures, to ensure that adequate advice is available 
for the operation of advanced equipment and techniques, and to accept respons- 
ibility for the assessment of hazards to themselves, to other laboratory users, and 
particularly to junior personal assistants. 

All major chemical companies, and most teaching establishments, now have a 
computerised stock-control system which enables information about 'on-site' 
availability and cost of chemicals to be rapidly obtained. Many companies are 
now linked to a central database (e.g. 'Chemquest', Pergabase Inc.), which pro- 
vides information (via text or graphics) on the world-wide commercial availabil- 
ity (from over fifty chemical catalogues) and on relative costs, etc., of fine 
chemicals. The hazards in use and disposal of all chemicals (see Section 2.3) may 
be readily checked from the catalogues of major chemical suppliers and other 
important sources. 

RECORDING OF RESULTS 

This is an important part of any chemical experiment, since careful observation, 
allied to accurate reporting, is the very essence of any scientific exercise. 

The guiding principle in writing up an experiment is to record all the details 
which would enable another person to understand what was done and to repeat 
the entire experiment exactly without prior knowledge. Thus, in addition to a 
written account of the work done, including notes on any special apparatus 
used, details of all volumes, weights, temperatures, times, chromatographic pro- 
cedures (e.g. t.l.c, g.l.c.) and conditions and results, etc., must all be recorded. 
The writing up of all laboratory work must be done at the time of the work, in a 
stiff-covered notebook of adequate size; a loose-leaved notebook is not suitable. 
It is important that numerical results such as yields, titration volumes, melting 
points and boiling points, etc., are entered directly into the notebook and not on 
scraps of paper. The latter are liable to be lost and their use encourages untidy 
practical habits. 

The recommended format is to use a fresh double-sided page for each new ex- 
periment or part of an experiment. The right-hand page should be used for a de- 

32 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.2 



scriptive account of what was done and what was observed at the time - the 
page must be dated. This account may be continued, if necesary, overleaf on the 
next right-hand (dated) page. The left-hand page should be reserved for 
equations, calculations of yields, melting points, reaction mechanisms, etc., and 
possibly a later commentary. A properly written experimental account should 
be generously spaced out so that the different sections are discernible at a glance. 
It is not a good idea to stick spectra and g.l.c. traces into the notebook, since it 
will rapidly become very bulky and the binding will be damaged. Rather they 
should be kept in a separate folder and cross-referenced with the numbered and 
dated pages of the notebook. 

During a reaction, all unexpected happenings and anything not understood 
should be carefully recorded at the time. Experiments sometimes go wrong, even 
with well-known procedures. (Note that there are often mistakes in the instruc- 
tions published in the chemical literature, e.g. decimal points in the wrong 
places, leading to the use of incorrect weights or volumes.) In such a case, the 
worker should always try to unravel the reason for failure of the reaction and to 
make suitable changes in the procedure, rather than just hurrying to repeat the 
experiment without modification. Indeed a properly conducted 'post-mortem' of 
an experimental result, leading, for example, to explanations of failure, planning 
to improve yields, or planning for further experimental development, can only 
be effective if the full details are available so that decisions can be made on the 
basis of reliable observation. 

It should be borne in mind in the case of project and postgraduate students, 
when embarking on their programme of work, that their experimental record 
may be the source material for subsequent publication in the chemical literature, 
the basis upon which the project report or thesis will be written, and the frame- 
work from which further studies may develop. 

CALCULATION OF YIELDS AND THE MONITORING OF 
REACTIONS 

The theoretical yield in an organic reaction is the weight of product which would 
be obtained if the reaction had proceeded to completion according to the chem- 
ical equation. The yield is the weight of pure product which is isolated from the 
reaction. The percentage yield may be expressed thus: 

weight of product 

theoretical yield 

All the reactions in this book, and most that are published in the chemical 
literature, give not only the quantities of reactants and reagents (weights in 
grams or milligrams, volumes/densities), but also their molar proportion (in 
moles, or millimoles, or the molar concentration of a reagent in solution). This 
allows a ready means for the calculation of the theoretical yield which is ex- 
pected on the basis of the chemical reaction, and also an assessment as to which 
reagents are being used in excess. If molar proportions are not quoted, these 
must always be calculated. Note of course that the calculation of the theoretical 
yield is based upon the molar quantity of the reactant or reagent in least 
amount. 

The success of a reagent is judged from the percentage yield, being excellent 
( &gt; 90%), very good ( &gt; 80%), good ( &gt; 70%), fair ( &gt; 50%) and poor ( &lt; 40%). The 
aim of the organic chemist when working on a reaction is to improve the yield, 

33 



2.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



and this requires judgement as to which of the following factors are in operation 
which may lead to a reduction in the amount of product formed. These include: 
(a) the fact that the reaction may be reversible and the position of equilibrium 
unfavourable to the product; (b) the incursion of side reactions leading to the 
formation of by-products; (c) the premature work-up of the reaction before its 
completion; (d) the volatilisation of products during reaction or during work- 
up; (e) the loss of product due to incomplete extraction, inefficient recrystallisa- 
tion or distillation operations, or other work-up procedures; and (/) the presence 
of contaminants in the reactants or reagents leading to a less efficient reaction. 

In order to assess the contribution of each of these factors, and hence to 
optimise yields (i.e. thereby to specify the quantities, reaction conditions and 
isolation sequence to achieve the highest feasible yield), all stages in the reaction 
and isolation operations need to be monitored. The qualitative monitoring of a 
reaction, usually by t.l.c. or g.l.c. analytical procedures (Section 2.31), and less 
frequently by n.m.r. spectroscopic analysis (see, for example, Expt 5.165), is a 
valuable means of establishing the complete disappearance of starting material, 
the number and significance of by-products, and the effectiveness of purification 
procedures. Frequently, however, it is desired to carry out the same reaction 
under a graded series of conditions (i.e. using different times, temperatures, 
solvent mixtures, molar ratios of reactants, etc.), or to survey the effectiveness of 
a reagent with a range of substrates, or of a range of reagents with the same 
substrate. To simplify the workload of such surveys, and to avoid numerous 
work-up sequences which may introduce mechanical variables, quantitative g.l.c. 
analysis is used if appropriate to give an accurate yield of product (g.l.c. % yield). 
(see Section 2.31). It should be pointed out that g.l.c. yields when quoted in the 
literature are always greater than isolated yields, often by a very significant 
amount. Therefore, while g.l.c. yields provide valuable information on the 
optimisation of conditions, the skill of the organic chemist lies in the technical 
ability to isolate pure products in high yields. 

Finally, when working in the field of asymmetric synthesis, the organic 
chemist needs to quote both the chemical yield and the optical yield. The per- 
centage optical yield or optical purity [enantiomeric excess (ee) %], is calculated 
thus: 

M^L_. /ol(1 o 

ix]\ of pure enantiomer 

It is essential that the specific rotation of the product and the pure enantiomer 
be measured in the same solvent, at the same wavelength and temperature, and 
at a similar concentration; if possible both measurements should be made at the 
same time. Optical yields in enzymic reactions carried out under laboratory con- 
ditions approach 100 per cent; an asymmetric chemical synthesis may be 
regarded as promising if the optical yield ranges upwards from 20 per cent. 

2.3 HAZARDS IN ORGANIC CHEMISTRY LABORATORIES 

2.3.1 INTRODUCTION 

It is emphasised in Sections 2. 1 and 2.2 that all workers in a laboratory must act 
responsibly in the interests of their own safety and that of their colleagues. These 

34 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.3 



sections include general guidelines on safe practice for common laboratory 
operations, and should be seen to supplement the individual safety information 
booklets which should be provided to all new members of a laboratory by the 
Safety Committee of the appropriate organisation.* In addition, members of a 
laboratory should have ready access to appropriate books dealing with com- 
monly encountered hazards. Two important publications are Hazards in the 
Chemical Laboratory, and Guide to Safe Practices in Chemical Laboratories, 
both of which are published by The Royal Society of Chemistry. 1 ' 2 Other im- 
portant texts which should be consulted are noted in the list of references. 3 " 5 

In teaching laboratories, and in laboratories concerned with routine work, 
the practical courses and operations will have been assessed for inherent 
hazards, appropriate cautionary advice provided, and periodic checks on the 
effectiveness of such advice made. In research and other laboratories, workers 
should always consult senior staff and the Safety Officer responsible for the 
laboratory or laboratory complex in those cases involving chemicals or opera- 
tions that represent a departure from previous experience. 

Each laboratory must be equipped with a first-aid box of a size and content 
appropriate to the number of members of the laboratory and the nature of the 
work being carried out. The HSE publishes guidelines on the contents of such 
boxes. 6 A wall chart of emergency treatment should be located adjacent to the 
first-aid box and all members of the laboratory should be familiar with this in- 
formation. Furthermore, the members of the laboratory should be aware of the 
name or names of the nominated trained first-aiders and where they may be con- 
tacted. A trained first-aider should be summoned in all cases of personal injury. 

2.3.2 EXPLOSION AND FIRE HAZARDS 

GENERAL ASPECTS 

Explosive and highly flammable substances or mixtures of substances quite 
commonly have to be used in organic chemistry laboratories. Ignorance of the 
hazards which are likely to be encountered all too frequently leads to explosions 
and fires, but these may usually be avoided and the experiment conducted with a 
reasonable measure of safety if, in addition to the general rules for laboratory 
practice mentioned under Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the following guidelines are fol- 
lowed. 

1. The use of a substance known to be explosive should be avoided if a safer 
alternative can be used. 

2. If an explosive or dangerously reactive substance has to be used, then it 
should be used in the smallest possible quantity and with all the appropriate 
precautions which are indicated below. 

3. Workers should try to foresee and avoid the situation where a dangerously 
reactive chemical is likely to come into contact with combustible material, or 
where an explosive substance is likely to be subjected to the stimulus of shock 
or excess heat. 

4. Reactions known or likely to involve explosion or fire hazards should always 
be tried out on a small scale first, and only then carefully scaled up in stages if 

* Regulations for the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) come into force in the 
UK in October 1989; those with responsibility for laboratory management should be familiar with 
these regulations. 

35 



2.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



no warning signs of danger are apparent (e.g. no undue rise in temperature or 
evolution of gas, etc.). Since for a reaction vessel the surface area per unit 
volume decreases with increasing volume, scaled-up reactions may exhibit 
unexpectedly large and possibly dangerous temperature rises. If a small-scale 
reaction procedure is known to be safe, it is better to repeat it several times to 
acquire the required stock of product, rather than to attempt to scale-up the 
process to achieve this in one step. 
5. For notably exothermic reactions involving dangerously active reagents, the 
safest procedure is to add the reagent dropwise, with rapid stirring, at the 
same rate as it is used up. Overcooling must be avoided since this may inhibit 
the reaction sufficiently to allow a dangerous accumulation of the reagents; if 
the temperature is then allowed to rise, a violent reaction may occur. It may 
actually be safer to heat such a reaction to ensure complete consumption of 
each drop of reagent as it is being added. 

EXPLOSIVE COMPOUNDS 

The following compounds or groups of compounds are likely to be dangerously 
explosive in their own right. They may explode under the stimulus of heat, 
impact or friction, or apparently spontaneously. 

1 . Acetylene gas and the acetylide salts of heavy metals; silver and copper acetyl- 
ides are extremely shock-sensitive. Polyacetylenes and some halogenated 
acetylenes. 

2. Hydrazoic acid and all azides, both organic and inorganic (only sodium azide 
is safe); aryl azides and silver azide may be inadvertently formed during some 
reactions (see below, p. 37). 

3. Diazonium salts (when solid) and diazo compounds. 

4. Inorganic nitrates, especially ammonium nitrate. The nitrate esters of poly- 
hydric alcohols. 

5. Polynitro compounds, e.g. picric acid (and heavy metal picrates), trinitro- 
benzene (TNB), trinitrotoluene (TNT); all these substances are safe when 
damp with water. 

6. Metal salts of nitrophenols. 

7. Peroxides; these are a common cause of explosions due to their formation in 
ether solvents (see below, p. 404). Concentrated aqueous hydrogen peroxide 
solution, see Section 4.2.41, p. 439. 

8. Nitrogen tribromide, trichloride and triiodide; these are all highly sensitive 
and violently explosive, and should never be prepared or used unless abso- 
lutely necessary. 

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS MIXTURES 

Powerful oxidants are particularly dangerous when mixed with easily oxidised 
organic substances such as simple alcohols, polyhydric alcohols, carbohydrates 
and cellulose-containing materials such as paper, cloth or wood. They are also 
dangerous when mixed with elements such as sulphur and phosphorus, and with 
finely divided metals such as magnesium powder. The following are common 
examples: 

1. Perchloric acid, chlorates and perchlorates. 

2. Chromium trioxide ('chromic anhydride'), chromates and dichromates. Con- 
centrated nitric acid and nitrates. 

36 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.3 



3. Permanganates. 

4. Concentrated hydrogen peroxide. 

5. Liquid oxygen and liquid air. 

SOME SPECIFIC DANGERS OF EXPLOSION 

Peroxides in ether solvents. This is one of the commonest causes of explosions in 
organic chemistry laboratories. Simple dialkyl ethers such as diethyl ether and 
di-isopropyl ether, and cyclic ethers such as 1,4-dioxane and tetrahydrofuran, 
form less volatile peroxides on exposure to air and light. If therefore one of these 
solvents is purified by distillation, the peroxide content in the residue is pro- 
gressively increased and eventually a violent explosion may occur. In view of 
this: (i) such solvents should not be stored for long periods or in half empty 
bottles; containers should be of dark glass; (ii) before the solvents are distilled a 
peroxide test should be carried out, and, if positive, the peroxide must be 
removed (Section 4.1.77, p. 402 and Section 4.1.75, p. 404); and (iii) since purified 
ethers in contact with air rapidly peroxidise again (10 minutes in the case of 
tetrahydrofuran) they should be retested for peroxides and purified if necessary 
immediately before use. 

Solid sodamide and potassium metal. Both of these substances undergo surface 
oxidation to give oxide films which may initiate explosions when the samples are 
handled. In the case of potassium, surface oxidation occurs even when the metal 
is stored under oil, and the act of paring off the oxide film with a knife may 
initiate an explosion. Samples of potassium which are heavily encrusted with 
oxide should not be used but should be carefully destroyed by adding the lumps 
to a large excess of propan-2-ol. Similarly, old or obviously encrusted (yellow) 
lumps of sodamide (Section 4.2.67) should not be ground in a pestle and mortar, 
but should be destroyed by mixing with solid ammonium chloride. 

Alkali metals with chlorinated solvents. The alkali metals sodium, potassium and 
lithium (and also other metals, e.g. aluminium and magnesium, especially when 
finely divided), are all violently reactive towards halogenated organic com- 
pounds, notably the common chlorinated solvents such as carbon tetrachloride. 
Lumps or chips of these metals should never be washed with halogenated sol- 
vents - a violent explosion can result. 

Perchloric acid. This can react violently with organic material such as cork, 
cloth, rubber or wood. In addition the fumes which are readily evolved from the 
liquid acid are easily absorbed by these substances which are thus rendered vio- 
lently flammable or explosive. For this reason, perchloric acid should not be 
stored in a wood-framed fume cupboard or near to any organic material. 

Chromic acid and nitric acid as cleaning agents. Violent explosions have ensued 
when attempts have been made to remove tarry residues from reaction flasks by 
adding chromic acid mixtures, or concentrated nitric acid, and heating. If such 
residues are not removed by chromic acid mixtures in the cold (even after pro- 
longed treatment with several changes of acid) followed by scrubbing with 
scouring powder, then the only safe course is to throw the flask away. 

Azides. Explosive aryl azides may be formed inadvertently during the Sand- 
meyer and other diazonium reactions. 

Explosive silver azide forms when solutions of ammoniacal silver nitrate 

37 



2.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(Tollen's reagent) are allowed to stand before use. This is extremely dangerous; 
Tollen's reagent should always be freshly prepared following the procedure 
given on p. 1219, taking care not to exceed the recommended concentrations. 
Unused reagent should be destroyed by the addition of aqueous sodium 
chloride. 

Liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen (b.p. — 196°C) contains some liquid oxygen 
(b.p. — 183 ' C) as an impurity and therefore evaporation leads to an increasing 
proportion of liquid oxygen, so that before complete evaporation occurs the 
residual liquid may contain up to 80 per cent of liquid oxygen. Contact of this 
residue with organic or combustible material of almost any sort is likely to cause 
an explosion. If Dewar flasks containing liquid nitrogen have been used as cool- 
ing baths, great care must be taken to ensure that all liquid nitrogen and oxygen 
has evaporated completely before the Dewar flask is used for another purpose 
(e.g. as an acetone -solid carbon dioxide cooling bath). 

Glass vacuum assemblies. Before using any glass apparatus for vacuum distilla- 
tion or sublimation it should be examined to ensure that, (i) it is of the correct 
thickness and type (thin-walled glassware and conical shaped flasks are not suit- 
able), and (ii) that it is free from cracks and flaws. Vacuum desiccators should 
always be used in the smallest suitable size and should be encased in wire safety 
cages. Dewar flasks can cause considerable damage since they may collapse vio- 
lently ('implode') if they are maltreated. All Dewar flasks should therefore be 
bound, over their entire length, with adhesive tape to contain flying fragments of 
glass in the event of an implosion. 

Opening glass ampoules. Ampoules of volatile chemicals must be thoroughly 
cooled before opening. Cooling must be effected with care, particularly if the 
contents are highly reactive (e.g. boron trichloride). If cooling is mishandled the 
glass may crack and the release of the contents into the cooling bath may lead to 
a violent explosion. Ampoules should not be cooled to a low temperature too 
quickly. Cooling in ice-water initially, followed by ice-salt, will usually be satis- 
factory; cooling to solid carbon dioxide temperatures is not necessary. 

If the contents have a tendency to decompose, considerable pressure may de- 
velop in the sealed ampoule on storage, and great care should be taken during 
opening. The cooled ampoule should be removed from the cooling bath and 
wrapped in strong cloth behind a safety screen. A clean scratch should be 
made in the neck of the ampoule with a sharp file or glass knife and the neck 
cracked off by touching the scratch with the molten end of a thin red-hot glass 
rod. 

Ampoules should be well cooled before resealing. Resealing should be 
avoided if possible however; it is best to obtain a smaller size of ampoule and use 
the whole of the contents for one experiment. 

Compressed gas cylinders. Under certain circumstances, cylinders of com- 
pressed gas may constitute major explosion and fire hazards and, despite their 
apparent robust construction, they should always be handled with care. 7 

In view of the high pressures involved, any possibility of slow leakage from a 
cylinder of a flammable or toxic gas should be carefully guarded against. Thus, 
gas should never be drawn from a cylinder unless the appropriate reduction 
valve has been correctly fitted. The main cylinder valve should never be opened 
more than is necessary to provide the required gas flow (two full turns of the 

38 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.3 



spindle at the most *); when the cylinder is not in use the gas should be shut off 
at the main valve and not at the regulator, which should then be bled of surplus 
pressure and closed. A suspected leak may be tested for by brushing with the 
approved leak detection solution, usually 1 per cent aqueous Teepol. 

The valves and screw threads of cylinders and regulators should never be 
greased since this may lead to an explosion. If a cylinder has a very stiff spindle 
valve or if the screw threads are damaged, it should be returned to the suppliers 
for replacement. Similarly, defective regulators and pressure gauges should 
never be used. 

The possibility of the sudden release of the entire contents of a cylinder must 
be guarded against. Apart from obvious dangers in the release of flammable or 
toxic gases, the sudden release of any gas can transform a cylinder into a lethal 
jet-propelled missile. Thus any weakening of a cylinder by damage, particularly 
to the valve, must be prevented. Cylinders must never be allowed to stand free in 
an upright position where they might be knocked over. They should be sup- 
ported either by strapping to a bench or wall, or kept in one of the special mobile 
trolleys available for the purpose. Cylinders should only be moved by the use of 
these trolleys. 

Gas cylinders should be stored upright in specially designated areas of 
moderate temperature which are adequately ventilated and entirely weather- 
proof. These areas should not be used to store any other chemicals and should 
be kept free from water, oils, or any corrosive liquids or vapours. The appropri- 
ate regulations should be consulted for the approved segregation of cylinders of 
different gases. Large notices labelled FULL and EMPTY should be promi- 
nently displayed on cylinders to prevent confusion and mistakes. A cylinder 
colour code data sheet should be permanently fixed to the wall of the cylinder 
store. All cylinders now carry a label which is designed to give appropriate safety 
information. 

As a general point, the regulations strongly recommend that no cylinder 
should be used in a laboratory, although small nitrogen cylinders for vacuum 
distillations, or small cylinders (lecture bottle size) of laboratory gases (e.g. 
chlorine, ethylene, etc.) may be acceptable exceptions providing appropriate 
precautions are taken in their use (see for example the BDH catalogue). Com- 
pressed gas supplies, for example for g.l.c. equipment, should be piped into the 
laboratory from cylinders located in a specially constructed area outside the 
laboratory. In the case of ammonia, when used in organic synthesis, the recom- 
mendations of Section 2.17.7, p. 1 16 should be noted. Acetylene cylinders should 
also be located in a specially constructed area adjacent to the dangerous opera- 
tions laboratory while in use, but then immediately returned to the main 
cylinder store. Academic and research institutions have their own specific regu- 
lations which should be complied with. 

FIRE HAZARDS 

Fire hazards in organic chemistry laboratories are often considerable due to the 
quantities of volatile and flammable chemicals, particularly solvents, which are 
commonly used. Specific methods for dealing with the more notable hazards are 
given below. 

* Spindles should never be fully unscrewed since some are not captive and will be blown out by the 
full gas pressure if they are unscrewed completely.

2.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Flammable solvents. Particular care should be taken when handling flammable 
solvents (and other chemicals) which are also highly volatile. The vapour may 
drift to a distant ignition source and burn back to ignite the main bulk of the 
liquid. An important rule is never to allow any vapour of a volatile chemical to 
escape into the open laboratory (in addition to fire hazards many vapours are 
toxic; see Section 2.3.4, p. 44). Strict regulations apply to the total quantity of 
solvents which may be stored in a laboratory, and with the exception of small 
bench reagent bottles, storage must be in approved cabinets. Bulk dispensing 
should take place in a designated area. Large quantities of solvent should not be 
allowed to accumulate on the work bench but returned to the storage area. If 
spillage of solvent or accidental release of flammable vapour occurs, the whole 
laboratory should be ventilated as soon as possible. The design and location of 
the main solvent store is subject to strict regulation. 

A measure of the flammability of a compound is given by the flash point (the 
temperature at which the liquid gives rise to ignitable vapour). Any liquid with a 
flash point of less than 15 °C should be regarded as dangerously flammable and 
treated accordingly. If a solvent also has a low autoignition temperature (the tem- 
perature at which the vapour will spontaneously ignite in air), it should be 
treated with particular care. 

Some highly flammable common solvents are given in Table 2.1 in order of 
increasing flash point. This does not include other dangerously flammable sub- 
stances not commonly used as solvents.

* Carbon disulphide has the very low autoignition temperature of 100°C. The vapour 
may therefore ignite on contact with steam pipes or with boiling water baths. 

Ignition sources. Naked flames should rarely be used in organic chemistry 
laboratories. The heating of reaction mixtures is much more safely accomplished 
by means of a steam bath, an electric heating mantle or an oil bath heated by 
means of a small electric immersion heater (or, less safely, by a hot plate). If Bun- 
sen flames have to be used, they should be lit only after a careful survey of neigh- 
bouring apparatus and chemicals has revealed no fire hazard. The flame should 
be turned out whenever it is not actually in use; a gas-air Bunsen flame may be 
invisible in bright sunlight and thus the cause of a fire or burning accident. 
If flammable vapour is allowed to accumulate in the vicinity of electrical 

40 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.3 



devices such as thermostats, stirrer motors, vacuum pumps, drying ovens, etc., it 
may be ignited by sparking from electrical contacts; this may be minimised by 
good laboratory ventilation and the prevention of the local build-up of solvent 
vapours. It should be noted that stirrers are available which are 'spark-free'; air- 
driven stirrers are also manufactured. 

Sparking of contacts has caused serious explosions and fires when domestic- 
type refrigerators have been used to store volatile substances, even in small 
quantities. There is now available an excellent range of specially designed labora- 
tory refrigerators. Since a volatile compound can have an appreciable vapour 
pressure at 0°C a dangerous concentration of vapour (which may be toxic) can 
accumulate within the cabinet of the refrigerator; volatile compounds should 
therefore be stored in clearly labelled glass containers, with well-fitting stoppers. 

Leaking oxygen cylinders. If a cylinder containing oxygen is allowed to leak 
over a period when normal ventilation is turned off, the concentration of oxygen 
in the air may become great enough to cause a very fierce fire in the event of an 
ignition source being present and of there being flammable materials in the 
vicinity. All compressed oxygen cylinders should be tested for leaks by brushing 
the valve joints with the approved leak detection solution. Leaking cylinders 
should be suitably labelled and returned to the suppliers. 

Sodium residues. Bottles containing sodium wire previously used for solvent 
drying constitute a fire and explosion hazard. The sodium, sometimes heavily 
coated with hydroxide or oxide film, should be covered with propan-2-ol and set 
aside with occasional swirling until all the sodium particles are destroyed (at 
least 2 hours). The contents of the bottle should then be poured into a large 
excess of water (water should not be added to the bottle) and the bottle washed 
out several times with industrial spirit. Only then can the bottle be safely rinsed 
with water. 

Fires involving sodium metal are very hot and localised and are best dealt 
with by smothering with sand or by using a dry powder extinguisher, not a car- 
bon tetrachloride or carbon dioxide extinguisher. 

Metal hydrides. Lithium hydride, sodium hydride, potassium hydride and lith- 
ium aluminium hydride all react violently with water liberating hydrogen; the 
heat of reaction may cause explosive ignition. Excess metal hydride from a reac- 
tion must be destroyed by the careful addition of ethyl acetate or acetone. 

Partially or fully alkylated metal hydrides (e.g. diethylaluminium hydride), 
are also pyrophoric and precautions in their use are noted under specific com- 
pounds in Section 4.2; handling techniques are discussed in Section 2.17.8, p. 120. 

THE DANGEROUS OPERATIONS LABORATORY 

It is strongly recommended that all reactions involving any possible hazard 
from explosive, flammable, dangerously reactive or highly toxic substances 
should be carried out in a special laboratory solely designed for the purpose. 
Such a laboratory should not be used for any routine teaching or research pur- 
poses, or for the storage of chemicals or apparatus apart from those required for 
specific hazardous reactions (e.g. autoclaves, furnaces, etc.). Ideally the labora- 
tory should be purpose-built and should incorporate the following safety 
features: 

1. Water-proof and vapour-proof electric lamps, switches and power points. 

41 



2.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



2. Fume cupboards fitted with powerful extractor fans capable of rapidly chang- 
ing all the air in the laboratory. 

3. Fire-resistant doors and walls. 

4. An adequate supply of protective clothing including safety visors and goggles, 
protective gloves, rubber aprons and boots. 

5. Good quality safety shields and screens for guarding potentially violent reac- 
tions. 

6. An automatic carbon dioxide fire-extinguishing system. 

7. The following should also be provided immediately outside the laboratory: 
storage facilities for gas masks and self-contained breathing apparatus; fire 
blankets, and buckets of sand for spilled liquids and for smothering fires; 
large carbon dioxide and dry powder extinguishers if no automatic fire 
extinguishing system is installed; a telephone with a clear notice beside it list- 
ing procedures and numbers to be dialled in an emergency. 

If no laboratory or other room is available for conversion to a dangerous 
operations laboratory, then a semi-permanent structure of adequate design sited 
at a safe distance from regularly occupied laboratories and offices may be con- 
structed from lightweight and fire-proof building materials (cf unattended 
operations, Section 2.16). 

THE CONDUCT OF EXPLOSIVE OR VIOLENT REACTIONS 

There is a common tendency to regard fume cupboards as the proper sites for 
potentially explosive or violently reactive processes. This is not to be recom- 
mended since the glass windows of fume cupboards may not be of sufficient 
quality and thickness to withstand an explosion, and the confinement of gaseous 
reaction products by the sides and top of the fume cupboard increases the sever- 
ity of the blast. All potentially violent reactions should therefore be conducted 
on an open bench, with the apparatus surrounded by safety shielding on all sides 
but open at the top. It has been shown that even flimsy protection at the top 
dramatically reduces the efficiency of such side screens to contain an explosion. 
The best design of safety shield is a flat plate of polycarbonate (minimum thick- 
ness 3 mm) suspended in a vertical plane from above, and heavily weighted 
along the bottom edge. The performance of conventional curved free-standing 
shields may be considerably improved by heavily weighting the bottom edge to 
prevent the whole shield being blown over in an explosion. 

2.3.3 REACTIVE INORGANIC REAGENTS 

Many inorganic reagents used in organic chemistry laboratories are highly reac- 
tive (and hence have 'corrosive' properties), causing immediate and severe 
damage if they are splashed or spilled on to the skin, or when they are inhaled as 
vapours, dusts or mists. In addition, their high reactivity may cause a rapid 
evolution of heat when they are mixed with other chemicals, including water, 
resulting in a corrosive and possibly toxic mixture being sprayed and splashed 
about; sometimes fires or explosions follow. When using such chemicals suitable 
protective clothing including gloves should be worn. Adequate protection of the 
eyes is absolutely essential and safety spectacles, or preferably goggles or a visor, 
must always be worn. When there is any possibility of inhalation of reactive 
vapours or dusts, all operations should normally be conducted in a fume cup- 

42 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.3 



board. Additonal protection may be provided by a gas mask or well-fitting dust 
mask. 

If any corrosive liquid or solid is spilled on to the skin it should be immedi- 
ately washed off with copious quantities of water; in cases of splashes in the eyes, 
every second counts. Any spillages should be cleaned up without delay, prefer- 
ably with the aid of sand. Flooding a spillage on a floor or bench with water is 
not always advisable if this is likely to spread the corrosive material and cause it 
to lodge in crevices and between floorboards. In cleaning up extensive spillage 
where noxious fumes are involved, full protective clothing including respirators 
should be used. 

Some highly reactive chemicals and their dangerous properties are listed 
below. Those which give off highly corrosive irritant and/or toxic vapours or, if 
solids, are similarly hazardous in the form of dusts, are marked with an asterisk 
(*) and should only be used in fume cupboards. More details concerning the 
properties of many of these are given in Section 4.2. Specific information on the 
hazardous properties of individual chemicals is collected in several comprehen- 
sive works. 8- " 

STRONG ACIDS 

All of the following react violently with bases and most give off very harmful 
vapours. 

* Hydrobromic acid and hydrogen bromide. 

* Hydrochloric acid and hydrogen chloride. 

* Hydrofluoric acid and hydrogen fluoride - both react readily with glass 
and quickly destroy organic tissue. New thick rubber or plastic gloves should be 
worn after carefuly checking that no holes are present. Skin burns must receive 
immediate and specialised medical attention. 

* Nitric acid (concentrated and fuming). 

* Perchloric acid (explosion danger, see Section 2.3.2, p. 37. 

Sulphuric acid (concentrated and 'oleum') - should always be mixed with 
water very carefully, by pouring into cold water as a thin stream to prevent acid 
splashes or spray. 'Chromic acid' cleaning mixtures have the corrosive proper- 
ties of concentrated sulphuric acid as well as the dangerous oxidising properties 
of the chromic acid. 

* Chlorosulphonic acid - this is a highly corrosive liquid which reacts 
violently with water. 

STRONG BASES 

Calcium oxide, potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide - these react 
violently with acids, generate heat on contact with water, and have a powerful 
corrosive action on the skin, particularly the corneal tissue of the eye. 

* Ammonia (gas and concentrated aqueous solution, d 0.880). Concentrated 
hydrazine solutions (and hydrazine salts); * hydrazine vapour is harmful. 

* Sodamide - usually obtained in a granular form which reacts violently with 
water; it is irritant and corrosive in a finely divided form. Old and highly coated 
samples should not be crushed for use but should be destroyed (see Section 2.3.2, 
p. 37). 



* Highly corrosive, irritant and/or toxic vapours or dusts. 

43 



2.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



HALOGENS 

All are toxic and corrosive. Great care should be exercised when working with 
fluorine, which is violently reactive towards a wide range of substances. The 
interhalogen compounds are also powerfully reactive. 

REACTIVE HALIDES 

All of the following are highly reactive, particularly towards water; ampoules of 
liquids should be opened in a fume cupboard after cooling, observing the pre- 
cautions detailed in Section 2.3.2, p. 38. 

* Boron trichloride; * phosphorus tribromide; * trichloride and * penta- 
chloride; * silicon tetrachloride. * Aluminium chloride and * titanium(iv) chlor- 
ide are rather less reactive. 

CHROMIUM TRIOXIDE, CHROMATES AND DICHROMATES 

All these form corrosive dusts; those from water-soluble chromates are particu- 
larly dangerous since they dissolve in nasal fluid and in perspiration. Long-term 
exposure can lead to ulceration and cancer. Chromium trioxide may cause 
sensitisation by skin contact. 

2.3.4 HAZARDS DUE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS 

A very large number of compounds encountered in organic chemistry laborator- 
ies are poisonous, i.e. 'toxic'. Indeed, nearly all substances are toxic to some 
extent and the adoption of safe and careful working procedures which prevent 
the entry of foreign substances into the body is therefore of paramount import- 
ance, and should become second nature to all laboratory workers. Toxic sub- 
stances can enter the body by the following routes: 

Ingestion (through the mouth). This is fortunately not common in laboratories, 
but can occur through the accidental contamination of food, drink or tobacco, 
and by misuse of mouth pipettes. It is strongly recommended that no one should 
ever eat, drink or smoke in a laboratory. The practice of storing bottles of milk 
or beer in laboratory refrigerators is to be strongly condemned. 

Workers should always wash their hands thoroughly on leaving a laboratory 
and before eating. All pipetting by mouth should be avoided since there are 
excellent rubber bulb and piston-type pipette fillers available commercially. 

In addition to the ingestion hazard associated with smoking, the vapours of 
many volatile compounds yield toxic products on pyrolysis when drawn 
through a lighted cigarette or pipe (e.g. carbon tetrachloride yields phosgene). 

Inhalation (into the lungs). This is a more common pathway for the absorption of 
toxic chemicals; these may be in the form of gases, vapours, dusts or mists. All 
toxic powders, volatile liquids and gases should only be handled in efficient fume 
cupboards. The practice of sniffing the vapours of unknown compounds for 
identification purposes should be conducted with caution. 

Direct absorption (through the skin into the bloodstream). This is also a common 
route for the absorption of a toxic substance whether liquid, solid or gaseous. 
The danger may be reduced by wearing rubber or plastic gloves, in addition to 
the usual laboratory white coat. However, clean and careful working procedures 
are still necessary despite these precautions. Protective gloves are often per- 

44 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.3 



meable to organic solvents and are easily punctured; they should therefore be 
frequently inspected and replaced when necessary. If a toxic substance is acci- 
dentally spilled on the skin, it should be washed off with copious quantities of 
cold water with the aid of a little soap where necessary. The use of solvents for 
washing spilled chemicals off the skin is best avoided since this may hasten the 
process of absorption through the skin. 

Repeated contact of solvents and many other chemicals with the skin may 
lead to dermatitis, an unsightly and irritating skin disease which is often very 
hard to cure. In addition, sensitisation to further contact or exposure may occur. 

The toxic effects of chemical compounds can be classified as either 'acute' 
(short term) or 'chronic' (long term). Acute effects, as exemplified by powerful 
and well-known poisons such as hydrogen cyanide and chlorine, are immedi- 
ately obvious, well appreciated by most laboratory workers, and are therefore 
fairly easily avoided. However, many chemicals exhibit chronic toxic effects 
which may only come to light after long-term exposure to small quantities. This 
type of insidious poisoning is harder to detect (and therefore prevent) since the 
results may only manifest themselves after months or even years of exposure (or 
even long after exposure has ceased). Chronic poisoning may also cause symp- 
toms which are not easily recognisable as such, e.g. sleeplessness, irritability, 
memory lapses and minor personality changes. It must be stressed, however, 
that the final results of chronic poisoning may be very serious and can lead to 
premature death. Every effort should be made by the laboratory worker to 
guard against these possibilities by adopting a rigorous approach to the avoid- 
ance of breathing all vapours and dusts, and of any contact between the skin and 
liquids or powders. 

There are available several designs of atmosphere-monitoring equipment. 
These employ an extremely wide range of individual detector tubes, which are 
specifically sensitive to commonly encountered gas and vapour contaminants 
that may be present in laboratory and industrial sites. The equipment is appro- 
priately designed for short-term (instantaneous) and long-term monitoring; per- 
sonal monitoring equipment for solvent vapour is also available (further 
information from Drager Ltd, or from Vinten Instruments Ltd). 

The guiding principle for all workers should be to treat all chemicals as 
potentially harmful. The following discussion (pp. 46-48) centres on compounds 
with acute toxic properties which are likely in organic laboratories; those which 
give rise to particularly severe chronic effects are noted on pp. 48-51. Substances 
marked C are also known to be carcinogenic, but the discussion of their avail- 
ability or control is noted. 

An indication of the hazard associated with the use of a toxic material in the 
form of a vapour or dispersed dust is given by a limit value. The threshold limit 
value (TLV, expressed as p.p.m. or mg m" 3 ) represents a level under which it is 
believed nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed to on a day-to-day basis 
without adverse effect. These values are up-dated annually and recommended 
by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists 
(ACGIH). 12 Since 1984, in the UK, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has 
adopted two types of limits, but only for those compounds which are available 
and used in the UK. 13 These are the recommended limit (RL, as p.p.m. or mg 
m " 3 ) which represents good practice and realistic levels for the degree of ex- 
posure, and the control limit (CL, as p.p.m. or mg m" 3 ) which is applied to the 
relatively smaller number of substances having unusually serious toxic effects. 



45 



2.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The control limits should not be exceeded and wherever possible reduced, and in 
any case these substances are subject to specific Regulations or Codes of Prac- 
tice. The RL values are annually reviewed, but the CL values may be altered at 
shorter time intervals. The TLV value is used in the UK if a RL or CL value is 
not available. With some substances, long-term or short-term exposure limit 
values (LTEL or STEL) are published. Finally it should be noted that the Coun- 
cil of Europe is proposing to introduce a harmonised list of exposure standards 
for adoption by the EEC countries. 

For detailed information on the toxicological properties of individual sub- 
stances reference should be made to the specialist monographs on the sub- 
ject, 14, 15 and to the comprehensive works already noted. 

HIGHLY TOXIC SOLIDS 

Even small quantities of these substances are likely to rapidly cause serious ill- 
ness or even death. Particular care should be taken to avoid inhalation of dusts 
and absorption through the skin as well as the more obvious hazards of direct 
ingestion.

OTHER HARMFUL SUBSTANCES 

The following compounds and groups of compounds have generally harmful 
effects when inhaled as vapours or dusts, or absorbed through the skin, or both; 
some are also corrosive. All should be regarded as potentially harmful by long- 
term exposure to small quantities. 

Alkyl bromides and chlorides. Many simple alkyl bromides and chlorides, and 
poly-halogenated methanes and ethanes fall into this category, including some 
common solvents. All should be treated as potentially harmful, but in addition 
to those already listed above the following may be regarded as some of the more 
dangerous.

Likewise many aromatic amines are extremely harmful as vapours and by 
skin absorption. The following list includes some representative examples, but 
all aromatic amines, including alkoxy-, halogeno- and nitro-amines should be 
treated as potentially harmful. In addition, many aromatic amines are known to 
be powerful cancer-causing agents (carcinogens; see below) and the use of some 
of these is legally controlled.

Phenols and aromatic nitro compounds. As with aromatic amines, very many 
phenolic compounds and aromatic nitro compounds exhibit toxic properties. 
They give off harmful vapours, are readily absorbed through the skin and, par- 
ticularly the phenols, have corrosive properties. All phenols and aromatic nitro 
compounds should therefore be handled with care and assumed to have the 
properties listed above.

CARCINOGENIC SUBSTANCES 

Many organic compounds have been shown to cause cancerous tumours in 
man, although the disease may not be detected for several years. The manufac- 
ture and use of some of these substances is forbidden in factories in Great Britain 
(according to The Carcogenic Substances Regulations 1 967) ' 6 and in the USA. It 
is essential that Safety Officers be fully aware of current regulations with regard 
to the use of these compounds in academic and research laboratories. 

When handling known or suspected carcinogens, every effort should be made 

48 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.3 



to avoid inhalation of their vapours and contamination of the skin. They must 
only be handled in fume cupboards using protective gloves. It is essential that 
bottles or vials containing the compounds should be properly labelled with suit- 
able warnings. Supplies of carcinogenic compounds should be kept in a locked 
container, preferably in a fume cupboard. 

The ACG1H (USA) has developed a triple classification of carcinogenicity of 
substances, and this classification has been adopted by the HSE (UK). These are 
'human carcinogens', 'suspected carcinogens' and 'experimental carcinogens'. In 
the UK, substances classified in the first category are subject to legal prohibition 
of manufacture and/or use; substances in the second category are subject to con- 
trol limits; substances in the third category are those in which less stringent pre- 
cautions may be permissible. It is essential that the Safety Officer be conversant 
with the regulations which pertain to the laboratory within his or her respons- 
ibility. 1 6 " "&gt; 

The most dangerous known carcinogens which are most likely to be encoun- 
tered in laboratory work are noted below. 

Aromatic amines, substituted hydrazines and their derivatives. These should all 
be treated as potentially carcinogenic, and as a group probably constitute the 
greatest danger to the organic chemist since even a slight exposure may initiate 
the formation of tumours. The following list includes some of the most 
hazardous substances. 

2-Acetylaminofl uorene 

2-Aminoazotoluene 

4-Aminobiphenyl* (and 4-nitrobiphenyl)* 

4-Aminostilbene 

3- Amino- 1 ,2,4-triazole 

Auramine and Magenta 

4,4-Diaminobiphenyl (benzidine)* 

4,4'-Diamino-3,3'-dichlorobiphenylt 

4,4'-Diamino-3,3'-dimethylbiphenylt 

4,4'-Diamino-3,3'-dimethoxybiphenylt (dianisidines)t 

Dimethylaminoazobenzene (Butter Yellow) 

1 , 1 -Dimethylhydrazine 

Hydrazine 

Methylhydrazine 

Af-Phenyl-2-naphthylamine 

2-Naphthylamine* 

1 -Naphthylaminef 

A'-Nitroso compounds. All nitrosamines [R'-N(NO)-R] and nitrosamides 
[R'-N(NO)COR] should be regarded as potentially powerful carcinogens, since 
most compounds of these types have been shown to possess high activity in ex- 
perimental animals. The following are some of the more likely to be encountered 
in the laboratory. 

N-Methyl-N-nitrosoaniline 

Af-Methyl-Af-nitrosourea 

* Importation and use in manufacture of these compounds is prohibited in the UK except if present 

at less than 1 per cent in another material.

Asbestos Inhalation of asbestos dust and fibres can cause 'asbestosis', a crip- 
pling and eventually fatal lung disease which often becomes lung cancer in its 
later stages. The industrial use of asbestos is strictly controlled in the UK by the 
Asbestos Regulations 1969. 20 

SUBSTANCES WITH VERY HARMFUL CUMULATIVE EFFECTS 

The substances noted here present chronic health hazards which are usually 
manifest after continued exposure over a relatively long period. In the case of 
workers handling this group of compounds, biological checks under the super- 
vision of a medical practitioner, to determine whether unacceptable absorption 
into the body is taking place, may be prudent. 

Benzene (RL lOp.p.m.). Inhalation of benzene vapour has a chronic cumulative 
effect leading to acute anaemia and may lead to leukaemia. Very few people can 
smell benzene in vapour concentrations of less than 75 p.p.m. (i.e. seven times the 

*t For footnotes, see p. 49. 

50 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.3 



RL). If therefore one can smell benzene, it is being inhaled in harmful quantities. 
For general solvent use, benzene can in nearly all cases be replaced by the less 
volatile and less toxic toluene (RL lOOp.p.m.). 

Lead compounds. These are powerful cumulative poisons and ingestion of even 
small amounts must be guarded against. Organic lead compounds (e.g. lead 
tetra-ethyl) are volatile and inhalation of their vapours must be avoided; they 
are also dangerous by skin absorption. 

Mercury and mercury compounds. These vary greatly in toxicity. Generally, 
mercury(n) salts are more toxic than mercury(i) salts. Liquid organic mercury 
compounds are highly poisonous and dangerous by inhalation and absorption 
through the skin, whereas solid organomercurials are less toxic. However, all 
mercury compounds should be treated with caution and any long-term ex- 
posure avoided. 

Elemental mercury readily evolves the vapour which constitutes a severe 
cumulative and chronic hazard.* No mercury surface should ever be exposed to 
the atmosphere but should be covered with water. All manipulations involving 
mercury should be carried out in a fume cupboard and over a tray to collect pos- 
sible spillage. Spilt mercury is best collected using a glass nozzle attached to a 
water suction pump via a bottle trap; the contaminated areas should be spread 
with a paste of sulphur and lime. 

A severe mercury vapour hazard may occur through misuse of mercury- 
containing vacuum gauges (e.g. the 'vacustat', Section 2.30) attached to oil 
vacuum pumps. If the gauge is turned about its axis too quickly, mercury may be 
sucked into the pump and circulated with the hot oil to release large quantities 
of mercury vapour into the atmosphere. If there is any possibility of this having 
happened, the pump must not be used and should be stripped down and cleaned 
as soon as possible. 

Isocyanates. These are highly toxic compounds, particularly toluene diisocyan- 
ate, which cause permanent lung damage on repeated exposure. Furthermore, 
over a period of time, the worker may become sensitised to isocyanates, such 
that subsequent undetectable concentrations produce severe symptoms. 

2.3.5 ELECTRICAL SAFETY 

Concern with the hazards associated with the use of flammable and toxic chem- 
icals in the laboratory often causes the dangers from electrical equipment to be 
overlooked. However, many accidents are caused by the malfunctioning of elec- 
tric appliances and by thoughtless handling. 

New equipment should be carefully inspected to check that the plug has been 
correctly fitted, otherwise a 'live' chassis will result. International standards for 
Great Britain and Europe stipulate the following colours for electric cables: 

Live, Brown; Neutral, Blue; Earth, Green/yellow. 

In the USA (and for equipment imported from the USA) the colours are: 

Live, White; Neutral, Black; Earth, Green. 

* The normal vapour pressure of mercury at room temperature is many times the CL value of 
0.05 mgm 3 . 

51 



2.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Before any electric appliance is used, it should be inspected to ensure that: (a) 
it is in good condition with no loose wires or connections; (b) it is properly 
earthed; (c) it is connected to the correct type of plug by good quality cable with 
sound insulation; and (d) that it is protected by a fuse of the correct rating. 
Loose or trailing electric cables should be avoided and if the appliance has to be 
sited some way from the power source, the cable should run neatly along the side 
of a bench and preferably be secured with adhesive tape. Cable hanging across 
the aisle between two benches should never be permitted. Any items of equip- 
ment (e.g. stirrer motors or heating mantles) which have had any chemicals 
spilled on them should not be used until they have been thoroughly cleaned and 
dried. 

In the handling and setting up of electrical equipment, the operator must en- 
sure that the apparatus is set up on a dry bench. It is essential to assemble the 
apparatus first, and only then to plug into the mains and switch on. The appar- 
atus should be switched off before any attempts are made to move or adjust it. 

High voltage equipment (e.g. for use in electrophoresis, or in the generation of 
ozone) requires special precautions. Ideally, such apparatus should be isolated 
within an enclosure equipped with an interlocking device so that access is pos- 
sible only when the current is switched off. 

2.3.6 ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION 

Ultraviolet (u.v.) lamps, arcs and other high intensity light sources which emit 
u.v. radiation should never be viewed directly or eye damage will result. Special 
close-fitting goggles which are opaque to u.v. radiation should be worn, and 
protective screens placed around the apparatus assembly (e.g. in a photo- 
chemical reaction) which incorporates the u.v. source; the need to avoid the 
inadvertent viewing of reflected u.v. light should also be borne in mind and the 
viewing of chromatographic columns or plates may be hazardous. Exposure of 
the skin to intense u.v. radiation gives rise to burns (cf. sunburn) and prolonged 
exposure may give rise to more extensive tissue damage. Protective gloves 
should therefore be worn during work involving such exposure risks. Adequate 
ventilation must also be provided to prevent possible build-up of the highly irri- 
tant and toxic ozone which is produced when oxygen is irradiated with u.v. light 
in the 185 nm region. 

APPARATUS AND REACTION PROCEDURES 
2.4 INTERCHANGEABLE GROUND GLASS JOINTS 

The commercial development of glass manipulation, coupled with the use of 
borosilicate glass having low expansion, resistance to heat, corrosion and ther- 
mal shock, has made available truly interchangeable ground glass joints at 
moderate cost. These, fitted to apparatus for standard and specialised opera- 
tions, have made laboratory work in practical organic chemistry, and indeed in 
many other branches of chemistry, easily accomplished. The advantages of the 
use of ground glass joints include: 

1 . No corks or rubber stoppers are, in general, required and the selection, boring 
and fitting of corks is largely eliminated, thus resulting in a considerable sav- 

52 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.4 



ing of time. Furthermore, contamination of chemicals as the result of contact 
with corks or bungs is therefore avoided. 

2. Corrosive liquids and solids (concentrated acids, acid chlorides, bromine, 
phosphorous pentachloride, etc.) are easily manipulated, and no impurities 
are introduced into the product from the apparatus. 

3. As all joints are made to accurate standards they should all fit well; this is par- 
ticularly valuable for systems operating under reduced pressure. 

4. By employing a few comparatively simple units, most of the common opera- 
tions of organic chemistry may be carried out. 

5. Wider passages are provided for vapours, thus diminishing the danger in viol- 
ent reactions and reducing the dangers of flooding from condensing vapours 
in distillations, especially under reduced pressure. 

As illustrated (Figs 2.1 and 2.6), the types of ground glass joints which are 
manufactured to precise specifications are either conical joints or spherical joints 
respectively. 

The interchangeability of conical joints (cone and socket joints) is ensured by 
the use of a standard taper of 1 in 10 on the diameter in accordance with the 
recommendations of the International Organisation for Standardisation and of 
the various national standardising authorities. The brand name 'Quickfit' is a 
registered trademark (J. Bibby Science Products Ltd) and used to describe

ground glass joints manufactured to the British Standards Institution (BS 572 
and 2761). In the USA interchangeable ground glass joints conforming to the 
specifications of the National Bureau of Standards (Commercial Standard CS 
21-58) are designated by the symbol IF.* It should be noted that the term 'cone' 
is used for the part which is inserted and the term 'socket' for the part into which 
the cone is inserted. 

The dimensions of conical joints are indicated by a numerical code which 
incorporates the nominal diameter of the wide end and the length of the ground 
zone, e.g. in British usage 14/23 indicates a wide end diameter of nominally 
14.5 mm, and a length of engagement of 23 mm; the USA code is similarly 
assigned. However, the length of engagement of the joints differs somewhat in 
the British and American specifications; consequently UK and European joints 
are not compatible with those manufactured in the USA, a point of particular 
note when ordering new, and perhaps specialised, apparatus. The dimensions of 
British and American interchangeable conical joints are listed in Tables 2.2 and 
2.3, respectively. 

The sizes of standard spherical joints (semi-ball or ball and socket joints) are 
designated by a code which indicates approximately the nominal diameter of the 
ground hemisphere, e.g. in British usage S35 designates a spherical joint of nom- 
inal diameter 34.925 mm. Sizes of spherical joints are collected in Tables 2.4 and 
2.5. 



2.5 TYPES OF GROUND GLASS JOINTS 

All ground glass joints are usually constructed of high resistance borosilicate 
glass such as Pyrex. The most common form of conical joint is shown in Fig. 2.1 
and is the type largely encountered in practice. That shown in Fig. 2.2 is similar 
but has reinforcing glass bands about the female joint which greatly add to the 
mechanical strength of the walls. Figure 2.3 depicts a ground glass joint with 
glass hooks, to which light springs may be attached. Figure 2.4 illustrates drip 
cones for condensers and the like. Figure 2.5 illustrates a cone joint with stem for 
use, for example, as a gas or steam inlet. 

* The specifications are obtainable from the British Standards Institution, 2 Park Street, London, 
Wl A 2BS; and from the Superintendent of Documents, US Government Printing Office, Washing- 
ton 25, DC.

The spherical or semi-ball joint is shown in Fig. 2.6 which includes one type 
of special clamp for holding the two halves of the joint together. This connection 
cannot freeze or stick (as conical joints sometimes do) and it introduces a degree 
of flexibility into the apparatus in which it is used. The area of contact between 
the ground surfaces is relatively small so the joints are not intended to provide 
for considerable angular deflection. The main application is in conjunction with 
conical joints rather than as a substitute for them. The conical-spherical 
adapters shown in Fig. 2.7 provide a means of inserting a spherical joint while 
retaining the conical joint principle. 

Precision made stopcocks, with interchangeable ground glass keys, are 
usually fitted with key retainers to prevent accidental loss or breakage during 
storage and use. 



56 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.6 



2.6 CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF GROUND GLASS JOINTS 

Great care must be taken to keep all ground glass surfaces free from grit or dust; 
during storage a strip of paper should be inserted into joints and stopcocks to 
prevent jamming. For work at atmospheric pressure, no lubricant should be 
required; it is advisable, however, in order to reduce the danger of sticking to 
apply a slight smear around the upper part of each ground joint of a rubber 
grease, Apiezon grease L or M, or Silicone stopcock grease. 

When salt solutions or alkaline substances may come into contact with 
ground glass surfaces, light lubrication of the surfaces is essential. When greas- 
ing stopcocks, only the outer parts of the plug should be lightly smeared with 
lubricant; in those cases where the lubricant is not harmful, the whole of the plug 
may be given a very thin smear of the grease but particular care must be taken to 
avoid the entrance of the lubricant into the bore of the plug. If necessary the bore 
of a stopcock can be cleaned conveniently with a pipe-cleaner. 

Lubrication of all ground glass surfaces is essential for distillations under 
reduced pressure. Suitable lubricants are Apiezon grease L, M or N and Silicone 
stopcock grease. The use of synthetic joint linings particularly in distillation 
assemblies is a very useful alternative to lubrication with grease and completely 
removes any possibility of lubricant contaminating the contents of the appar- 
atus. Joint linings (or sleeves) are available in polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), a 
polymer extremely resistant to chemical attack and to heat (up to 250 °C); a 
PTFE film may also be applied to the joint surface using an aerosol spray. 

SEIZING OF GROUND GLASS JOINTS 

Provided adequate care is exercised to use only joints that fit well, and the 
ground surfaces are suitably lubricated and parted after use while still warm, 
sticking will rarely occur. If, however, a ground joint should seize up or freeze 
the following suggestions may be found useful: 

1. Set the joint in a vertical position and apply a layer of glycerine or penetrating 
oil to the upper surface. The glycerine will slowly penetrate into the joint, thus 
permitting the separation of the ground surfaces. 

2. If procedure (1) is unsuccessful, direct a stream of hot air from a blower on to 
the outer surface of the joint for a few seconds and gently draw the members 
apart with a twisting action; gentle tapping on the edge of a wooden bench is 
sometimes helpful. 

3. Introduce the joint into a small luminous Bunsen flame for a few seconds, and 
then gently draw the ground surfaces apart. If the glass is of Pyrex (or of any 
other heat-resisting variety), there is very little danger of a crack resulting 
from this process. The object of the heating is to cause the glass of the socket 
to expand before any appreciable change has occurred in the inner cone. 
More even, gentle and local heating of the joint, which is particularly suitable 
for stoppered flasks containing volatile, flammable or corrosive liquids, may 
be achieved by the following procedure. Wrap the flask in several layers of 
cloth with the neck protruding and hold securely within a fume cupboard; 
wrap, with one turn, a piece of fibrous string around the outside of the ground 
glass joint, and with a to-and-fro pulling action on the two string ends (gently 
at first until the rhythm of motion is acquired), allow the circle of string 

57 



2.7 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



around the joint to move smoothly along its length. Two operators are 
required, the one holding the flask steady should ensure that the stopper is 
directed away from both in case of accidents; both should be wearing safety 
spectacles. After a few minutes the joint will have heated sufficiently by fric- 
tion and to a temperature leading to a smaller risk of decomposition of sub- 
stances held between the joint surfaces than by the flame method; frequently 
the stopper may be removed by pulling with a twisting motion. 
4. Frozen stopcock joints, or adapters or still-heads in empty flasks, may fre- 
quently be freed by immersion in an ultrasonic cleaning bath (Section 2.1, 
p. 29). 

2.7 APPARATUS WITH INTERCHANGEABLE GROUND GLASS JOINTS 
SUITABLE FOR GENERAL USE IN PREPARATIVE ORGANIC 
CHEMISTRY 

In considering the following typical standard units of equipment fitted with 
ground glass joints, it must be borne in mind that while a particular piece of 
glass equipment of certain capacity or dimensions may be fitted with alternative 
joint sizes, the range is usually restricted in relation to their relative proportions. 
When equipping a laboratory, it is usually convenient to limit the range of 
socket sizes thus permitting interchangeability with the minimum number of 
adapters. For example, with Quickfit, 14/23, 19/26, 24/29 and 34/35 joints are 
suitable for macro scale experiments, and 10/19 and 14/23 for semimicro scale 
experiments; a similar selection would be appropriate from the USA coded sizes. 
In Fig. 2.8(a)-(d), the various designs of flasks are collected. Type (a) is a 
pearshaped flask, the capacity range being usually 5 ml to 100 ml, the joint sizes 
are in the range 10/19 to 24/29. Type (b) is a round-bottomed flask (short- 
necked), the capacity range being 5 ml to 10 litres, joint sizes being in propor- 
tion; medium- and long-necked designs are also available. Type (c) illustrates a 
range of wide-necked reaction flasks which are useful in semimicro and in pilot 
scale experiments and which are fitted with large diameter flat-flange joints, the 
capacities range from 250ml to 20 litres, the flange bore being 75 mm to 100 mm 
respectively; the multi-socket lids are illustrated in Fig. 2.18(a) and (b). The 
advantages of this type of reaction vessel are that (i) the lids are easily detach- 
able, (ii) large stirrers are readily accommodated, (iii) the vessels are cleaned 
readily and (iv) the removal or addition of solids and viscous fluids is facilitated; 
the ground flange joints are fully interchangeable. Special clamps are available 
for the support of such flasks. Type (d) of Fig. 2.8 is a jacketed flange flask which

is ideally suited for reactions requiring accurate temperature control. The 
example illustrated is available from J. Bibby Science Products Ltd. Other 
designs are available from, for example, Wheaton Scientific. 

Various types of multi-necked round-bottomed flasks are illustrated in Fig. 
2.9(a)-(d); designs with pear-shaped flasks are available. The centre socket is 
usually the larger and the side sockets are generally smaller; type {d) shows the 
side socket being employed for the insertion of a capillary tube necessary in a 
vacuum distillation assembly (see Section 2.27). 

Ground glass stoppers of all standard sizes are available and may be of the 
design shown in Fig. 2.10; the flat head is preferred since the stopper may be 
stood on end when not in use, thus avoiding contamination of the ground sur- 
face; an additional refinement is the provision of a finger grip. 

Often in the assembly of apparatus, joint adapters are required if the joint 
sizes of the various parts are not compatible. A reduction adapter is illustrated in 
Fig. 2.11 and an expansion adapter in Fig. 2.12; numerous combinations are of 
course possible, but it must be emphasised, however, that in a well-designed 
assembly of apparatus the number of adapters should be reduced to a minimum 
and, best of all, completely eliminated. 

Distillation heads (or still-heads) are shown in Fig. 2. 1 3 (a)-(c). Type (a) is a 
bend ('knee-tube') which is frequently employed for those distillations which 
merely require the removal of solvent. Type (b) is a simple distillation head; 
when fitted into a flask with a ground glass socket, the assembly is virtually a 
distillation flask. For some purposes, a thermometer may be fitted into a one- 
hole rubber stopper of correct taper and then inserted into the socket; the area of 
rubber which is exposed to the organic vapour is relatively so small that the 
amount of contamination thus introduced is negligible. If, however, all rubber 
stoppers must be absent because of the highly corrosive nature of the vapour, a 
thermometer fitted with an appropriate size cone is employed. Alternatively the

socket of a distillation head may be fitted with a screw-capped adapter (see Fig. 
2.32) through which a thermometer may be inserted. Type (c) is a Claisen distil- 
lation head; the left-hand socket accommodates the capillary tube for use in dis- 
tillations under vacuum (see Section 2.27) and the right-hand socket a suitable 
thermometer. 

Frequently for semimicro and micro work it is more convenient to use the 
pear-shaped flask designs which incorporate the distillation heads (e.g. Fig. 
2.14(a) and (b). 

Multiple adapters provide for additional entries into a single-necked flask 
when a multi-necked flask is not available. Either double-necked or triple- 
necked adapters (Fig. 2.15 and Fig. 2.16(a) and (b) are commonly used having a 
range of socket and cone sizes. The 'swan-neck adapter' of Fig. 2. 1 7 is useful for 
vacuum distillations as it permits the insertion of a capillary tube through the 
screw thread joint. This joint may also be used for insertion of a thermometer or 
a gas inlet in the narrow neck and a reflux condenser into the ground joint; this 
device virtually converts a three-necked flask into a four-necked flask. 

Multiple socket lids for fitment to the flange flasks (illustrated in Fig. 2.8(c)) 
are shown in Fig. 2. 1 8(a) and (ft). These allow for the introduction of a great 
variety of standard equipment for stirring, temperature measurement, the inlet 
of gas, etc. The sockets may be vertical or angled at 5, 10 or 15 degrees from the 
vertical axis. 

Several types of condensers are widely used (Figs 2.19-2.23). An improved 
form of Liebig's condenser, sometimes termed a West condenser, is shown in 
Fig. 2. 1 9; it has an inner tube with very thin walls and the space between it and 
the heavy-walled outer tube is small, consequently there is a rapid heat transfer 
to the fast-flowing cooling water leading to greater efficiency. The length of the 
jacket is usually 6 to 50 cm and the design is available in a range of joint sizes.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.7

Figure 2.20 (Davies type) and Fig. 2.21 (double coil type) are examples of effi- 
cient double surface condensers. Figure 2.22 depicts a 'screw' type of condenser 
(Friedrich pattern); this highly efficient condenser is employed for both reflux 
and downward distillation. The ice or dry ice-acetone condenser (Fig. 2.23) is 
useful for volatile liquids. 

The water inlet and outlet side-arms on the condensers illustrated are of the 
standard olive all-glass type. Breakage can easily occur, often resulting in serious 
hand injury, when attaching or detaching rubber or plastic water hoses. A recent 
design (Bibby Science Products) incorporates a screw-thread at side-arm ends 
on to which a plastic hose connector may be screwed to give a watertight seal. 
Not only is this safer in the hands of less experienced workers, but it allows for 
more rapid apparatus assembly. 

Various forms of receiver adapters or connectors for attachment to the end of 
condensers when used in a distillation assembly are shown in Figs 2.24-2.26.

The simplest form (Fig. 2.24) carries glass hooks for securing it to the condenser 
by means of a rubber band from the side tube to the hook; an improved form, 
incorporating two glass joints, is shown in Fig. 2.25. A useful adapter is illus- 
trated in Fig. 2.26; when employed at atmospheric pressure, a drying tube may 
be attached to the side tube, if desired; in a distillation under reduced pressure, 
the side tube is connected to a vacuum pump. 

Cone/rubber tubing adapters {^take-off adapters), shown in Fig. 2.27(a) and 
(b), fulfil a number of useful purposes in preparative organic operations, for 
example where very small volumes of solvents need to be rapidly removed. 

A calcium chloride guard-tube is illustrated in Fig. 2.28 which is widely used 
for protecting apparatus assemblies from the ingress of moisture. 

For many operations the globular form of dropping, addition or separatory 
funnel having a suitable cone joint fitted to the stem is convenient, but when 
required on either a multiple-necked flask or with a multiple adapter, the cylin- 
drical design (Fig. 2.29) is preferred; this is similarly provided with a cone on the 
stem and a ground socket. Figure 2.30 illustrates a cylindrical funnel with 
pressure-equalising tube; this is invaluable for reactions which are conducted in 
an atmosphere of inert gas. Either funnel may be fitted with an all-glass or a 
Rotaflo stopcock; the latter gives excellent liquid flow control. Jacketed drop- 
ping funnels for use with ice-water or dry ice-acetone slurry coolants are avail- 
able and are useful when reagents to be added to a reaction mixture need to be 
kept at low temperatures. Dropping funnels are also available with a design of 
stopcock which allows infinite control of the rate of addition.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.8 



The two designs of the Dean and Stark apparatus (Fig. 2.31(a) and (b); avail- 
able from Bibby Science Products) carry a flask on the lower cone and a reflux 
condenser on the upper socket. They are used for the automatic separation of 
two immiscible components in a distillate and the subsequent return of the 
upper layer (a) or the lower layer (b) to the reaction flask. 

2.8 OTHER TYPES OF INTERCHANGEABLE JOINTS AND STOPCOCKS 

In some reactions the presence of a ground glass surface may initiate a rapid de- 
composition of reaction products and the danger of an explosion. One such 
reaction is the formation of diazomethane (Section 4.2.25, p. 430). In these cases 
the glass 'Clear-seal' joint (Wheaton Scientific) is essential. This type of joint 
needs no lubrication or plastic seals, does not allow seepage of solutions into the 
joint, and being transparent allows for ready observation of thermometer scales 
that cannot be seen with the ground glass type. 

The useful screw-thread connector is becoming widely available. The simplest 
is the screw-capped adapter (Fig. 2.32) where the screw-capped joint is asso- 
ciated with a ground glass cone. The figure shows the silicone rubber ring and 
PTFE washer, and the adapter is useful for the insertion of gas tubes, ther- 
mometers or stirrer shafts. The screw-thread connection principle has been 
applied to the connection of water hoses to condensers and vacuum lines to 
Buchner flasks, to securing simple sealing septa to flasks, etc. 

Stopcocks of the standard design are available with interchangeable Teflon 
plugs (or keys) fitted to the glass barrels. The Rotaflo design (Fig. 2.33) is now a 
commonly used alternative. It consists of a fully interchangeable PTFE key, 
incorporating a unique locking device to avoid total accidental unscrewing. The 
general purpose (GP) design is used in dropping funnels, burettes, etc., and pro- 
vides excellent liquid flow control. A high performance (HP) design, which oper- 
ates at reduced pressures down to lOmmHg, is invaluable for incorporation into 
high vacuum systems. 

The 'O-ring joint' (manufactured by, for example, J. Young and Co. Ltd) (Fig. 
2.34) is particularly suitable for incorporation into vacuum line assemblies. The 
joint consists of a slightly tapered cone, with a terminal annular indentation 
carrying a replaceable PTFE ring seal, which is inserted into a suitably-sized 
socket. The PTFE ring provides a seal under vacuum and also allows for a 
degree of flexibility in the vacuum line which facilitates assembly. The O-ring 
seal principle has also been incorporated into the design of, for example, stop-

2.9 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



cocks, screw-thread connectors, and dry, lubricant-free seals in vacuum desic- 
cators. 

Rubber (red or silicone) septa (Fig. 2.35), are widely used for fitting to sockets 
of flasks to allow injection or removal of liquids or gases via syringes or cannu- 
lae (Section 2.17.8, p. 122). The annular serrations depress against the glass wall 
providing an excellent seal, and the turnover flange is moulded to grip the out- 
side of the container neck. 



2.9 THE USE OF CORKS AND RUBBER STOPPERS 

Although these have been largely replaced by ground glass joints, corks and 
rubber stoppers still find occasional use in the laboratory. 

Two points must be borne in mind when selecting a cork stopper. In the first 
place, the cork should be examined for flaws; unless corks of the highest quality 
are employed, they are liable to have deep holes, which render them useless. In 
the second place the cork should fit into the socket to only about one-quarter of 
its length. It should then be softened by rolling in a cork press or by wrapping it 
in paper and rolling under the foot. 

To bore a cork, a borer should be selected which gives a hole only very slightly 
smaller than that desired. The cork borer is moistened with water or alcohol or 
better still with glycerol. The borer is held in the right hand and the cork in the 
left hand. The hole is started at the narrow end with a continuous rotary motion. 
Beginners should bear in mind that the borer is a cutting instrument and not a 
punch, and on no account should it be allowed to burst its way through the cork 
because the borer, upon emerging, will almost invariably tear the surface of the 
cork. It is a good plan to examine the borer from time to time as it advances 
through the cork to see that it is cutting a straight hole. Boring should be 
stopped when it is half through the cork and the tool removed from the hole. 
The cork plug is pushed out with the aid of the solid metal rod supplied with the 
set of borers, and the remainder of the hole is bored from the other end. If the 
holes are carefully aligned, a clean cut hole is obtained. Experienced laboratory 
workers frequently complete the whole boring operation from one side, but 
beginners usually tear the edges of the cork by this method. A well-fitting cork 
should slide over the tube (side-arm of distilling flask, thermometer, lower end of 
condenser, etc.) which is to pass through it with only very moderate pressure. 
The bored cork should be tested for size; if it is too small, the hole should be 
enlarged to the desired diameter with a small round file. When the correct size is 
obtained, the tube is held near the end and inserted into the cork. The tube is 
then grasped near the cork and cautiously worked in by gentle twisting. Under 
no circumstances should the tube be held too far from the cork nor should one 
attempt to force a tube through too small an opening in a cork; neglect of these 
apparently obvious precautions may result in a severe cut in the hand from the 
breaking of the glass tube. The sharp edges of freshly cut glass tubing must be 
smoothed by fire polishing (Section 2.10). 

For consistently successful results in cork boring, a sharp cork borer must be 
used. The sharpening operation will be obvious from Fig. 2.36. The borer is 
pressed gently against the metal cone, while slight pressure is applied with the 
cutter A at B; upon slowly rotating the borer a good cutting edge will be 
obtained. If too great pressure is applied either to the borer or to the 'cutter', the 

64 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.10 



A 

I

result will be unsatisfactory and the cutting circle of the borer may be damaged. 
To maintain a cork borer in good condition, it should be sharpened every 
second or third time it is used. 

To bore a rubber stopper, it is essential to employ a very sharp cork borer of 
the same size as the tube to be inserted into the hole. The borer is lubricated with 
a little glycerol or alcohol and steadily rotated under only very slight pressure. 
The operation requires a good deal of patience and time and frequent lubrica- 
tion may be necessary; if too much pressure is exerted on the borer, a hole of 
irregular shape and diminishing size will result. 

The insertion of a glass tube into the rubber stopper or into rubber tubing is 
greatly facilitated by moistening the rubber with a little alcohol. Some grades of 
synthetic polymer tubing are only semi-flexible and are best fitted on to a glass 
tube after softening by immersion of the ends in a boiling water bath. 

After some use rubber may stick to glass and great care must be taken not to 
break the glass tube when removing it. Frequently the exertion of gentle pres- 
sure on the rubber stopper by means of the two thumbs while the end of the tube 
rests vertically on the bench will loosen the stopper; this operation must, how- 
ever, be conducted with great care. Another method is to slip the smallest pos- 
sible cork borer, lubricated with a little glycerol, over the tube, and gradually to 
rotate the borer so that it passes between the stopper and the glass tube without 
starting a new cut. In cases of difficulty it is always safer, and in the end more 
economic, to cut the rubber stopper away from the glass tube. 

2.10 CUTTING AND BENDING OF GLASS TUBING 

Many students tend to forget the practical details learnt in elementary courses of 
chemistry; they are therefore repeated here. To cut a piece of glass tubing, a clean 
scratch is first made with a triangular file, sharp glass knife or diamond pencil. 
The tubing is held in both hands with the thumbs on either side of the scratch, 
but on the side opposite to it. The tubing is then pulled gently as though one 
wanted to stretch the tube and also open the scratch. A break with a clean edge 
will result. The cut edge must then be rounded or smoothed by fire polishing. 
With soda-glass the end of the tube is heated in the Bunsen flame until the edges 
melt and become quite smooth; the tube is steadily rotated all the time so as to 
ensure even heating. Overheating should be avoided as the tube will then par- 
tially collapse. Manipulations with Pyrex glass tubing, either fire polishing, 
bending, or drawing into a capillary leak for vacuum distillations (Section 2.27), 
have to be carried out in the flame of an oxygen-gas blowpipe. 

A 'batswing' or 'fish-tail' burner is generally used for the bending of soda glass 
tubing. Both hands are used to hold the tube in the length of the flame (Fig. 

65 



2.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 







(a) 




Fig. 2.37 



2.37(a)) so that 5-8 cm are heated: the tube must be slowly rotated about its axis 
so as to heat all sides equally. As soon as the glass is felt to be soft, it is bent to 
the required shape. This is best done by removing it from the flame and allowing 
one end to fall gradually under its own weight, while being guided so that it is in 
the same plane as the rest of the tube. The glass must never be forced, otherwise 
a bad bend with a kink will be obtained as in Fig. 2.37(c). 



2.11 GENERAL LABORATORY APPARATUS 

Apart from the ground glass apparatus discussed in the previous sections, the 
student should also be aware of the range of other equipment available from 
general laboratory suppliers which is used in the course of preparative and 
analytical work. It should be remembered however that often the practical 
worker has to design, from the available equipment, pieces of apparatus to carry 
out a specific operation. This is particularly necessary when handling semimicro 
and micro quantities of material. Instances are cited in the later sections on 
isolation and purification procedures where designs are suggested. 

Various types of flasks are shown in Fig. 2.38(a)-(e). Types (a) and (b) are 
flat-bottomed flasks (the Florence flask) with or without a wide neck, of capaci- 
ties between 50 ml and 20 litres, the larger sizes having a tooled ring neck (b) to 
increase mechanical strength; type (c) is the round-bottomed flask having capa- 
cities of between 50 ml and 20 litres; type (d) is the short-necked boiling flask 
(the so-called bolt-head flask) with a tooled ring neck, of capacities between 
50 ml and 10 litres. Type (e) is the familiar Erlenmeyer or conical flask obtain- 
able in narrow and wide mouth designs, with and without graduations, in sizes 
which range from 5 ml to 6 litres. 

The usual Griffin form of beaker with spout, Fig. 2.39(a), is widely used. Sizes 
between 5 ml and 6 litres are available. The conical beaker, Fig. 2.39(b), occa- 
sionally finds use in preparative work. Some designs have a Teflon (PTFE) rim 




EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.11 




(b) 



Fig. 2.39 




to enable aqueous solutions to be poured safely, drop by drop, if necessary. 
Polypropylene and polyethylene beakers are available in various sizes but have 
more limited use being unable to withstand temperatures above 120°C and 
being unsuitable for use with many organic solvents. PTFE beakers are very 
much more expensive but are able to withstand temperatures up to 300 °C and 
are inert to most chemicals. 

Various kinds of funnels are depicted in Figs 2.40(a) and (b), and 2.41(a)-(c). 
Figure 2.40(a) and (b) are long and short stem (0.5-1 cm) designs of ordinary fil- 
tration funnels respectively having a 60° angle; a wide-stemmed design of (b) is 
useful when transferring powders. The funnels in Fig. 2.41 are known as separ- 
atory funnels (obtainable in capacities between 25 ml and 5 litres); type (a) is the 
pear-shaped form and is the most widely used; types (ft) and (c) are the conical 
and cylindrical separatory funnels respectively; the latter being available in a 
graduated form. The use of separatory funnels fitted with Teflon or with Rotaflo 
stopcocks reduces the problems associated with tap seizure and also avoids the 
use of lubricants which may contaminate the products. 

When it is required to filter hot solutions, as for example in recrystallisations 
employing decolourising charcoal (Section 2.20), a heated jacket around the fil- 
tration funnel is necessary. A simple, inexpensive form is shown in Fig. 2.42; it 
consists of a coil made of copper of about 10 mm diameter forming a 60° cone 
which may be readily constructed in the laboratory workshop. Hot water or 
steam is passed through the coil, hence it is very suitable for the filtration of 
flammable liquids. The coil may also be used in 'cold filtration' and in some 
forms of sublimation apparatus (Section 2.21) by circulating ice-cooled water 






Fig. 2.42 



67 



2.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



through the coil. The multipurpose heating mantle (Electrothermal Engineer- 
ing) (Fig. 2.47(c)) is particularly suitable for hot nitrations since only the lower 
heating element need be used. 

Funnels which are suitable for filtration by suction are illustrated in Fig. 
2A3(a)-(f). The Buchner funnel shown in (a) is made of porcelain and has a per- 
forated porcelain plate to support a filter paper. A Buchner funnel (and other 
funnels described below) is used in conjunction with a filter (suction) flask or 
tube into which it is fitted by means of a rubber stopper; alternatively the use of a 
flat annular rubber ring to provide a seal between flask and funnel (as in (c)) is 
often more convenient. The side-arm of the flask or tube is attached by means of 
thick-walled rubber tubing ('pressure tubing') via a suitable trap to a water 
pump (Section 2.19). The Hirsch funnel shown in (b) has sloping sides and is 
designed to deal with a smaller amount of precipitate than is the Buchner funnel. 
The smallest size will accommodate filter papers 3-4 mm in diameter. The l slit 
sieve' funnel (d) is constructed entirely of glass (Jena or Pyrex) and therefore pos- 
sesses obvious advantages over the opaque (porcelain) Buchner or Hirsch 
funnel. Similar advantages are apparent with the sintered glass funnel {e\ which 
is available in a number of porosities (coarse, medium and fine). 

The Buchner and Hirsch funnels, and the filter flasks and tubes, are available 
with interchangeable ground glass joints (for example, Fig. 2.43(f)). The 
Buchner funnel is also available with a screw-thread side-arm for easy attach- 
ment via a plastic hose connector to the vacuum line (Bibby Science Products).

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.11 



Spatulas in stainless steel, nickel, flexible horn, or moulded polythene are 
available commercially. One such design of palette knife has a flexible stainless 
steel blade provided with a wooden handle. Nickel spatulas may have turned-up 
ends, or spoon- or blade-shaped ends, and are available in sizes from 100 mm x 
5 mm (for semimicro work) to 200 mm x 10 mm (for macro work). 

Solids which are moist with either water or organic solvents are routinely 
dried in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature. Several high dome safety 
desiccators are available commercially in sizes which range from 76 mm (micro) 
to 305 mm in diameter. Those in which a glass or ebonite side entry tap socket of 
the interchangeable type (usually 34/35 joint size) is fitted to the lid, are to be 
preferred. Figure 2.44 shows one such desiccator with a Rotaflo stopcock as- 
sembly with plastic safety connector (Bibby Science Products); in this case the 
air inlet to the desiccator terminates in a hooked extension which serves to en- 
sure that the air flow when the vacuum is released is directed in an even upward 
spread to prevent dispersal of the sample. The joint between the lid and the base 
may be an interchangeable ground flange and this joint needs lubrication (e.g. 
with Apiezon grease) before the desiccator is evacuated. In this type the lid is 
removed by side pressure after the vacuum has been released. A 'Dry-Seal' joint 
(developed and marketed by Jencons) is that in which a groove in the top flange 
of the desiccator base accommodates a removable elastomer sealing ring. This 
ring becomes flattened by the lid when the vacuum is applied, the design being 
such that over-compression is avoided. No lubricants are required, and when 
the vacuum is released the lid is simply lifted off- the removal of desiccator lids 
in the ground flange type can cause considerable difficulty. In use, all vacuum 
desiccators must be sited in an appropriately sized and totally enclosed wire-mesh 
desiccator cage; desiccator implosion may occur at any time when it is under 
vacuum, and represents a serious hazard. 

Ordinary (i.e. atmospheric pressure) desiccators are available in the Dry- 
Seal or ground flange range and have limited use for storage of samples in a dry 
atmosphere. 

The nature of the charge in a desiccator, which is placed in the lower com- 
partment below the metal gauze plate, is dependent on whether water or organic 
solvents are to be removed and whether acidic or basic vapours are likely to be 
evolved during the drying process. Suitable charges are discussed in Section 
2.20.

2.12 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



2.12 COOLING OF REACTION MIXTURES 

It is often necessary to obtain temperatures below that of the laboratory. Finely 
crushed ice is used for maintaining the temperature at 0-5 °C; it is usually best to 
use a slush of crushed ice with sufficient water to provide contact with the vessel 
to be cooled and to stir frequently. It is of course essential to insert a ther- 
mometer into the reaction mixture to ensure that the desired temperature is 
attained. For temperatues below 0°C, the commonest freezing mixture is an 
intimate mixture of common salt and crushed ice: a mixture of one part of 
common salt and three parts of ice will produce a temperature of about —5 to 
— 18 °C. Greater cooling may be obtained by the use of crystalline calcium 
chloride; temperatures of —40 to — 50 °C may be reached with five parts of 
CaCl 2 .6H 2 and 3.5-4 parts of crushed ice. 

If ice is temporarily not available, advantage may be taken of the cooling 
effect attending the solution of certain salts or salt mixtures in water. Thus a 
mixture produced by dissolving 1 part of NH 4 C1 and 1 part of NaN0 3 in 1-2 
parts of water causes a reduction in temperature from 1 to — 1 5 °C to — 20 °C; 
3 parts of NH 4 C1 in 10 parts of water from 13 to — 15°C; 11 parts of 
Na 2 S 2 3 .5H 2 in 10 parts of water from 1 1 to - 8 °C; and 3 parts of NH 4 N0 3 
in 5 parts of water from 13 to — 13°C. 

Solid carbon dioxide (Dry Ice, Drikold, Cardice) is employed when very low 
temperatures are required. The commercially available blocks are stored in spe- 
cially insulated containers. Since frostbite may result from handling solid carbon 
dioxide, it is advisable to either wear gloves or to cover the hands with a thick 
cloth. Conveniently small-sized lumps may be obtained by hammering, with a 
wooden or polyethylene mallet, a suitable large piece wrapped in a cloth or con- 
tained within a stout canvas bag. The small pieces are carefully added to either 
ethanol or acetone in a plastic bowl until the lumps of solid carbon dioxide no 
longer evaporate vigorously. The temperatures attained are in the region of — 50 
to — 70 °C according to the efficiency of the lagging around the freezing bath. In 
order to keep the freezing mixture for hours or overnight, it should be prepared 
in a Dewar flask. 

The use of cooling baths employing other solvents with solid carbon dioxide 
enables other temperatures to be attained. An extensive list has been pub- 
lished 21 from which the following have been selected: ethylene glycol/Cardice, 
- 1 5 °C; acetonitrile/Cardice, -42 °C; diethyl ether/Cardice, - 100 °C. A steady 
state temperature cooling bath may also be obtained by adding solid carbon 
dioxide to o-xylene : m-xylene mixtures 22 ; the volume fraction of o-xylene deter- 
mines the temperature of the bath. For example, m-xylene/Cardice, — 72 °C; o- 
xylene (0.4) : m-xylene (0.6), -58°C; o-xylene (0.8) : m-xylene (0.2), -32°C. 

The attainment of temperatures lower than — 100 °C requires the use of baths 
employing liquid nitrogen, 23 either alone, or admixed with other solvents. The 
hazards of using liquid nitrogen are pointed out in Section 2.3.2, p. 38, and the 
use of such cooling baths is not advised except in the hands of experienced 
workers.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.13 



2.13 HEATING OF REACTION MIXTURES 

Heating of aqueous solutions is most conveniently carried out using a Bunsen 
burner with the glass vessel suitably supported on a tripod and ceramic -centred 
gauze; it is essential to use a heat resistant bench mat, and under no circum- 
stances should such apparatus be left unattended. It is also imperative that no 
other worker using flammable solvents is in the vicinity. 

In the case of solutions of flammable liquids having a boiling point below 
100 °C, the stainless steel electrically-heated water bath or steam bath provided 
with a constant-level device must be used. The individual circular type is pro- 
vided with a series of concentric rings in order to accommodate flasks and 
beakers of various sizes. A rectangular type, suitable for use in student classes, 
has several holes each fitted with a series of concentric rings. In both cases the 
water bath is fitted with an immersion heating element controlled by a suitable 
regulator. 

For temperatures above 100 °C, oil baths are generally used. Medicinal paraf- 
fin may be employed for temperatures up to about 220 °C. Glycerol and dibutyl 
phthalate are satisfactory up to 140-1 50 °C; above these temperatures fuming is 
usually excessive and the odour of the vapours is unpleasant. For temperatures 
up to about 250 °C, 'hard hydrogenated' cottonseed oil, m.p. 40-60 °C, is recom- 
mended: it is clear, not sticky and solidifies on cooling; its advantages are there- 
fore obvious. Slight discoloration of the 'hard' oil at high temperature does not 
affect its value for use as a bath liquid. The Silicone fluids, e.g. Dow Corning 550, 
are probably the best liquids for oil baths but are somewhat expensive for 
general use. This Silicone fluid may be heated to 250 °C without appreciable loss 
or discoloration. Oil baths should be set up in the fume cupboard wherever pos- 
sible. A thermometer should always be placed in the bath to avoid excesive heat- 
ing. Flasks, when removed from an oil bath, should be allowed to drain for 
several minutes and then wiped with a rag. Oil baths may be heated by a gas 
burner but the use of an electric immersion heater is safer and is to be preferred. 
A satisfactory bath suitable for temperatures up to about 250 °C may be pre- 
pared by mixing four parts by weight of 85 per cent ortho-phosphoric acid and 
one part by weight of meta-phosphoric acid; the mixed components should first 
be heated slowly to 260 °C and held at this temperature until evolution of steam 
and vapours has ceased. This bath is liquid at room temperatures. For tempera- 
tures up to 340 °C, a mixture of two parts of 85 per cent ortho-phosphoric acid 
and one part of meta-phosphoric acid may be used: this is solid (or very viscous) 
at about 20 °C. 

High temperatures may be obtained also with the aid of baths of fusible metal 
alloys, e.g. Woods metal - 4 parts of Bi, 2 parts of Pb, 1 part of Sn and 1 part of 
Cu - melts at 71 °C; Rose's metal - 2 of Bi, 1 of Pb and 1 of Sn - has a melting 
point of 94 °C; a eutectic mixture of lead and tin, composed of 37 parts of Pb and 
63 parts of Sn, melts at 183 °C. Metal baths should not be used at temperatures 
much in excess of 350 °C owing to the rapid oxidation of the alloy. They have the 
advantage that they do not smoke or catch fire; they are, however, solid at ordin- 
ary temperature and are usually too expensive for general use. It must be 
remembered that flasks or thermometers immersed in the molten metal must be 
removed before the metal is allowed to solidify. 

One of the disadvantages of oil and metal baths is that the reaction mixture 

71 



2.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



cannot be observed easily; also for really constant temperatures, frequent adjust- 
ment of the source of heat is necessary. These difficulties are overcome when 
comparatively small quantities of reactants are involved, in the apparatus 
shown in Fig. 2.45 (not drawn to scale). 

A liquid of the desired boiling point is placed in the flask A which is heated 
with an electric mantle (see below). The liquid in A is boiled gently so that its 
vapour jackets the reaction tube BC; it is condensed by the reflux condenser at 
D and returns to the flask through the siphon E. Regular ebullition in the flask is 
ensured by the bubbler F. The reaction mixture in C may be stirred mechanic- 
ally. It is convenient to have a number of flasks, each charged with a different 
liquid; changing the temperature inside C is then a simple operation. A useful 
assembly consists of a 50 ml flask A with a 19/26 joint, a vapour jacket about 
15 cm long, a 34/35 joint at B and a 19/26 or 24/29 joint at D. 

The following liquids may be used (boiling points are given in parentheses): 
pentane (35 °C); acetone (56 °C); methanol (65 °C); carbon tetrachloride (77 °C); 
trichloroethylene (86 °C); toluene (1 10 °C); chlorobenzene (1 32-1 33 °C); bromo- 
benzene (155 °C); p-cymene (176 °C); o-dichlorobenzene (180 °C); methyl ben- 
zoate (200 °C); tetralin (207 °C); ethyl benzoate (212 °C); 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene 
(213 °C); isopropyl benzoate (218 °C); methyl salicylate (223 °C); propyl ben- 
zoate (231 °C); diethyleneglycol (244 °C); butyl benzoate (250 °C); diphenyl 
ether (259 °C); dimethyl phthalate (282 °C); diethyl phthalate (296 °C); benzo- 
phenone (305 °C); benzyl benzoate (316 °C). 

An air bath is a very cheap and convenient method of effecting even heating 
of small distillation flasks (say, 25 ml or 50 ml), where the use of a micro Bunsen 
burner, results in fluctuations in the level of heating due to air draughts. It may 
be readily constructed from two commercial tin cans (not aluminium) (those 
from tinned fruit or food are quite suitable), of such sizes that one fits into the 
other to provide a small concentric gap as an air insulator. The cleaned large can 
is cut to the same height as the small can, and the base is then removed. The 





(«)

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.14 



cleaned smaller can has a number of holes punched in the base. The edges of 
both cans must be smoothed and any ragged pieces of metal removed. A circular 
piece of ceramic paper (1 mm thickness) of the same diameter of the smaller can 
is inserted over the holes. A piece of reinforced calcium silicate matrix (6 mm 
thickness) of diameter slightly greater than the larger can is then obtained and a 
hole of suitable diameter made in its centre; the sheet is than cut diametrically. 
The two halves which constitute the cover of the air bath, will have the shape 
shown in Fig. 2.46(b). The diameter of the hole in the lid should be approxim- 
ately equal to the diameter of the neck of the largest flask that the air bath will 
accommodate. The air bath, supported on a tripod and wire gauze, is heated by 
means of a Bunsen burner; the position of the flask, which should be clamped, is 
shown in Fig. 2.46(a). The flask should not, as a rule, rest on the bottom of the 
bath. The advantages of the above air bath are: (a) simplicity and cheapness of 
construction; (b) ease of temperature control; (c) rapidity of cooling of contents 
of the flask either by removing the covers or by completely removing the air 
bath; and (d) the contents of the flask may be inspected by removing the covers. 

Heating mantles provide one of the most convenient means of controlled 
heating of reaction vessels. They consist of a heating element enclosed within a 
knitted glass-fibre fabric which is usually protected with a safety earth screen 
(Fig. 2.47(a), Electrothermal Engineering). The heating unit is enclosed within 
an outer rigid housing (often of polypropylene or aluminium) which is appro- 
priately insulated so that the mantle may be handled at a low outer case temper- 
ature. Heating control is by in-built or external energy regulators. Fixed sizes for 
round-bottomed flasks having capacities from 50 ml to 5 litres are standard (e.g. 
Fig. 2.47(b), Isopad). In addition a multipurpose unit is now available which will 
accept a variety of different sized flasks of round-bottomed or pear-shaped 
design (Fig. 2.47(c), Electrothermal Engineering); this unit has a bottom outlet 
to accept 60° angle funnels to be heated in hot nitrations, in which case only the 
lower section of the heating element need be activated. Further designs of 
mantle (Electrothermal Engineering) are the fully enclosed flexible heating 
mantle with elastic neck entry which is often convenient when the apparatus as- 
sembly does not allow the satisfactory support of the encased type, and the heat- 
ing mantle with in-built stirrer (Fig. 2.47(d)). Other manufacturers are Glas-Col 
and Thermolyne Corp, and the units are available through Aldrich Chemical 
Co. Ltd. 

Electric hot plates may also be employed in the case of flat-bottomed vessels, 
and are provided with suitable energy regulators. Various sizes are available for 
individual use or for groups of students. The heating surface may be either cast- 
iron aluminium-sprayed, or a glass-ceramic surface. In the former case it is often 
advisable to interpose a sheet of ceramic paper between the metal top and the 
vessel to be heated, particularly if the contents of the latter are liable to 'bump'. 
Electic hot plates should not be used with low boiling, flammable liquids (e.g. ether, 
light petroleum, etc.) contained in open beakers since ignition can frequently occur 
when the heavier vapour spills on to the heated surface. 



2.14 MECHANICAL AGITATION 

Mechanical stirring is not necessary in work with homogeneous solutions except 
when it is desired to add a substance portion wise or dropwise and to bring it as

rapidly as possible into intimate contact with the main bulk of the solution. This 
applies particularly in those cases where a precipitate is formed and adsorption 
may occur, or where heat is generated locally which may decompose a sensitive 
preparation. In such cases the solution must be continuously agitated by 
manual shaking or, preferably, by mechanical stirring. When large quantities of 
material are to be dealt with, it is much easier and much more efficient to employ 
mechanical stirring. The importance of mechanical agitation cannot be over- 
estimated where heterogeneous mixtures are involved. In many preparations the 
time required for completion of the reaction is shortened, temperatures are more 
readily controlled, and the yields are improved when mechanical agitation is 
employed. No apology is therefore needed for discussing this subject in some 
detail. 

Stirring in open vessels, such as beakers or flasks, can be effected with the aid 
of a stirrer attached directly to a small electric motor by means of a chuck or a 
short length of 'pressure' tubing, although in these circumstances some form of 
stirrer guide is advisable; for example, a sleeve of glass tubing, lubricated with 
glycerol, having a diameter slightly greater than that of the stirrer shaft and sup- 
ported in a clamp. 



75 



2.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Excellent stirring units are available commercially, and include 'explosion- 
proof and 'air-driven' designs (Gallenkamp, Jencons, etc.). The geared-drive 
model (the Citenco stirrer, available from, for example, Jencons) gives good con- 
trol of stirring performance. These stirrers may often be fitted with a flexible 
drive shaft so that the motor may be placed some distance from the stirrer head 
and reaction vessel, thus enabling the assembly to be used for flammable, corros- 
ive or fuming liquids without damage to the motor. 

Stirrers are usually made of glass, but those of Monel metal, stainless steel or 
Teflon also find application in the laboratory. An important advantage of a 
stirrer with a Teflon blade is that it is comparatively soft and merely bends if it 
hits the glass even at high speed; furthermore, it can be shaped to fit the bottom 
of the vessel, thus rendering the stirring of small volumes of liquid in a large flask 
possible. A few typical stirrers are shown in Fig. 2.48 (a)-(e); types {a) and {b) 
may be easily constructed from a glass rod. Types (c) and (d) are the Teflon and 
the glass-link stirrer respectively; because of the flexible end they possess the 
advantage that they may be inserted through a narrow neck; in (c) the half- 
moon shape allows it to be employed for stirring liquids in round-bottomed or 
flat-bottomed vessels (the latter by turning the blade over). Type (e) is a stainless 
steel propeller blade stirrer. 

A useful stirrer - sometimes termed a Hershberg stirrer - for efficient agita- 
tion in round-bottomed vessels, even of pasty mixtures, is presented in Fig. 2.49. 
It consists of a glass rod to which a glass ring is sealed; the glass ring is threaded 
with chromel or nichrome or tantalum wire (about 1 mm diameter). By sealing 
another glass ring at right angles to the first and threading this with wire, even 
better results will be obtained. The stirrer is easily introduced through a narrow 
opening, and in operation follows the contour of the flask; it is therefore particu- 
larly valuable when it is desired to stir a solid which clings obstinately to the 
bottom of a round-bottomed flask. 

Some form of suitable stirrer seal must be provided in any of the following 
operations: (a) simultaneous stirring and refluxing of a reaction mixture; (b) stir- 
ring the contents of a closed vessel; (c) agitation with the prevention of the 
escape of gas or vapour; and (d) stirring in an inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen. 

A simple rubber sleeve gland (the Kyrides seal) is illustrated in Fig. 2.50; the 
short length of rubber tubing attached to the ground glass cone projects to form 
a tight seal around the stirrer shaft (5-6 mm). Glycerol (or Silicone grease) is 
applied at the point of contact of the glass and rubber to act as a lubricant and 
sealing medium. This seal may be used under reduced pressures down to about 
10-12 mmHg; it is not dependable for stirring operations lasting several hours 
since the rubber tubing may stick to the shaft and may also be attacked by 




Fig. 2.49

organic vapours, causing it to swell and allow the escape of vapours. In these 
circumstances the screwcap gland, Fig. 2.32, may be used when the Silicone 
rubber ring should be similarly lubricated; this type of seal is not suitable for use 
at high speeds or under vacuum. 

Precision ground stirrer /stirrer guide units (Jencons) eliminate the need for 
any form of additional seal and can be used very satisfactorily under vacuum, in 
which case a trace of Silicone grease as lubricant is recommended. The long 
length of the ground bearing substantially reduces the problem of 'whipping' 
and vibration. Figure 2.51(a) shows the general purpose type with a cone joint; a 
design in which the water-cooling jacket surrounds the precision ground tubes is 
also available. A useful variant is illustrated in Fig. 2.51(b) in which a vapour 
'take off outlet is provided; it is also of use for reactions performed under an 
inert atmosphere. 

Ground sleeve glands have largely replaced the conventional mercury-sealed 
stirrer, one design of the latter which is suitable for general laboratory use is 
illustrated in Fig. 2.51(c). It is not as versatile as the ground sleeve type; high 
speeds introduce the hazard arising from spattering mercury (in which case gly- 
cerol is a safer alternative) and the seal is not suitable for use under vacuum. 

A type of stirrer, known as a Vibro-mixer and of particular value for closed 
systems, is illustrated in Fig. 2.52, fitted into the central neck of a flask. The 
enclosed motor, operating on alternating current, vibrates the stirrer shaft at the 
same frequency as the a.c. mains, moving up and down in short, powerful 
strokes. A control knob at the top of the stirrer housing is provided for adjusting 
the stroke length from gentle stokes (0.2 mm) to powerful strokes (c. 2 mm in 
thrust). As it is a non-rotating stirrer, a hermetic seal with the reaction flask can 
be made easily. Several type of stirrer blades are available; two 'plate' stirrers are 
shown in Fig. 2.52(A and B). In A the holes taper upward; the liquid will (on the 
downstroke) flow up through the wide lower orifices to be violently expelled 
through the narrower orifices at the top. The principle involved is similar to 
what happens when water flowing through a pipe suddenly enters a narrower 
pipe; the speed of flow is greatly increased. In B the holes taper downward; excel- 
lent mixing is thus obtained for solids, etc., at the bottom of the vessel. The base 



77 



2.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




Fig. 2.52 



of the stand upon which the stirrer is mounted rests upon anti-vibration mats in 
order to reduce vibration to a minimum. No guide for the stirrer shaft is neces- 
sary; the stirring is very efficient and particularly suitable for PTC experiments. 
Several forms of mechanical shaking machines are employed for automatic 
mixing of heterogeneous systems and find many applications in the organic 
chemistry laboratory. Two of these are illustrated in Fig. 2.53(a) and (b). Type 
(a) is the bottle/flask shaker (Gallenkamp) in which the carrier will accommo- 
date six 2-litre Winchester pattern bottles held horizontally; an interchangeable 
platform enables the shaker to be converted to accept a number of conical flasks, 
up to 77 x 250 ml or 20 x 2 litres. Type (b) is a 'wrist-shaker' which will accom- 
modate up to 8 x 50ml flasks; although not all positions need to be occupied, the 
load must be balanced. 

Magnetic stirring is now widely used. A rotating field of magnetic force is 
employed to induce variable speed stirring action within either closed or open 
vessels. The stirring is accomplished with the aid of small permanent magnets 
('followers') sealed in Pyrex glass, polypropylene or Teflon.* The principle of 
magnetic stirring will be evident from Fig. 2.53(c). A permanent bar magnet, 
mounted horizontally, is attached to the shaft of an electric motor; the whole is 
mounted in a cylindrical housing with flat metal top and heavy cast metal base. 
An energy regulator (which is frequently incorporated in the housing) is pro- 
vided to control the rate of stirring. To use the apparatus, the regulator, which is 

* The 'followers' are available in different lengths and of varying designs to fulfil a range of stirring 
requirements, such as would be necessary with differently shaped vessels or with fluids of different 
viscosities.

initially in the off-position, is slowly rotated (this increases the motor speed) 
until the required rate of stirring is attained. When the experiment is complete, 
the regulator is returned to the zero position, the 'stirrer' allowed to come to rest 
and removed with the aid of a pair of forceps.f 

Magnetic stirring has many obvious applications, but the most important 
are probably to stirring in closed systems, e.g.: (a) where gas volume changes 
must be observed as in catalytic hydrogenations; (b) where exclusion of air is de- 
sirable to prevent oxidation; (c) where reactions are to be carried out in an 
anhydrous environment; and (d) where small containers are used and the intro- 
duction of a propeller shaft is inconvenient. 

Many forms and sizes of magnetic stirring apparatus are available commer- 
cially. These include those fitted with an electric hot plate attached to the flat 
top, the temperature of which is controlled by an energy regulator. Electric heat- 
ing mantles are also available in which magnetic stirring is incorporated so that 
both heating and stirring is possible in an apparatus assembly using round- 
bottomed flasks [e.g. solid-state Stirrer Mantle (EMA) from Electrothermal 
Engineering Ltd, Fig. 2.47(d)]. This design gives control over a range of volumes 
and viscosities of fluids in the flask, and additionally bi-directional or reverse 
stirring at 20 second intervals is a further facility. Magnetic stirring may not be 
effective if the medium is excessively viscous, or if substantial amounts of solids 
are present. In such cases mechanical stirrers must be used. 

2.15 TYPICAL GROUND GLASS JOINT ASSEMBLIES FOR STANDARD 
REACTION PROCEDURES 

It is hoped that the account of the interchangeable ground glass joint apparatus 
already given will serve as an introduction to the subject. For the numerous 
applications of such apparatus, the reader is referred to the catalogues of the 
manufacturers listed in Appendix 7. Most of the simpler operations in practical 
organic chemistry may be carried out with a set of apparatus which can be pur- 
chased for a comparatively modest sum. Indeed, such a set is the first in a pro- 
gressive series of 'Quickfit' sets which are specifically designed to cover the 
experimental requirements of practical chemistry in many different fields and in 
scales ranging from gram to kilogram quantities. For student work, in either 
introductory or advanced multi-stage experiments, the glassware is supplied in 
boxes fitted with integral plastic trays so that each item fits into a moulded well 
marked with the appropriate catalogue number. Checking equipment and its 
storage is therefore greatly simplified. 

Some typical assemblies are collated in the following diagrams, which repres- 
ent most of the basic reaction procedures which are adopted in the later experi- 
mental sections. 

An assembly for heating a reaction mixture under reflux is illustrated in Fig. 
2.54. The precise design of condenser depends upon the volatility of the reaction 
liquid, low boiling liquids (&lt;60°C) require the use of a double surface con- 
denser. Additionally a calcium chloride tube may be inserted at the end of the 
condenser if the reaction mixture contains moisture-sensitive components. It is 

t A useful recovery device for followers is made by forcing a small bar magnet into the end of stiff 
polymer tubing.

important that 'boiling chips' (carborundum, or broken porcelain) are added 
before heating (whether by gas or by electrical means, or whether using an oil or 
a water bath) is commenced. 

For the purpose of heating a reaction mixture under reflux with addition of 
liquid the assembly shown in Fig. 2.55 is suitable. The two-way adapter and flask 
shown here may, of course, be replaced by a two-necked flask. Manual agitation 
may be required at intervals to ensure good mixing, alternatively the vigour of 
boiling may automatically aid the mixing process. The selection of condenser 
design, the presence of calcium chloride protecting tubes (on condenser and 
separatory funnel) and the mode of heating depend upon the nature of the reac- 
tants. 

It should be emphasised that the apparatus assemblies described above are 
for those cases where the reaction mixture is a homogeneous liquid. With reac- 
tion mixtures having suspended solid components or with reaction mixtures 
involving immiscible liquids stirring is essential. An assembly for heating under 
reflux with the addition of liquid and with stirring is shown in Fig. 2.56. The stirrer 
shown may of course be omitted and agitation effected with a magnetic stirrer 
incorporated in an electric hot plate or heating mantle (Section 2.14). 

In an experiment where the addition of a moisture-sensitive solid (e.g. anhyd- 
rous aluminium chloride) in small portions to a reaction mixture is required, but 
where no requirement of heating under reflux is necessary, the simplest assembly 
is that shown in Fig. 2.57. Here the side socket is fitted with a length of wide, 
thin-walled rubber tubing and a 100 or 250 ml conical flask containing the 
reagent is inserted into the other end of the tubing. The solid is readily added in 
portions by raising the flask; the latter can be cut off from the reaction mixture 
by 'kinking' the rubber tube. The diagram also shows that the central cone has 
been fitted with a suitable stirrer (see Section 2.14) and the third socket may be 
fitted either with a calcium chloride tube or with an appropriate nitrogen 
inlet system (see Fig. 2.58) if an inert atmosphere is to be preserved. The stirring 



81 



2.1 i PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




Fig. 2.57 

is of course essential and is far more efficient and convenient than manual 
agitation. 

An alternative design for the addition of solid is shown in Fig. 2.58 which also 
illustrates a nitrogen inlet system. It may be constructed, if desired, from a small 
pear-shaped flask, and a broken pipette; the connections are bored rubber of a 
size appropriate to fit into the sockets. The solid is charged into the conical 
reservoir; by raising the plunger to the appropriate height, any desired amount 
of solid may be made to flow into the reaction vessel, and the flow can be com- 
pletely stopped by merely twisting down the plunger until the rubber ring seals 
the opening. The rubber ring should be, say, 3 mm thick and 5 mm wide; if sol- 
vents which attack rubber are present a neoprene gasket may be used. The 
rubber tubing at the top is lubricated with glycerol (Kyrides seal) to make an

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.1 i 



air-tight joint which will allow free movement of the plunger. The hopper may 
be recharged during the reaction without breaking the seal by lifting the stopper 
while holding down the pipette. 

Where the addition of solid is required to a reaction mixture, which is being 
heated under reflux with stirring, either of these devices may be attached to the 
upper socket of the reflux condenser, which must, of course, be of the Liebig 
type. In these circumstances a second reflux condenser must be fitted with a 
guard-tube or with a nitrogen inlet system (cf. Fig. 2.60) to allow for equilib- 
ration of pressure within the apparatus. 

The addition of a gas to a reaction mixture (commonly the hydrogen halides, 
fluorine, chlorine, phosgene, boron trifluoride, carbon dioxide, ammonia, 
gaseous unsaturated hydrocarbons, ethylene oxide) requires the provision of 
safety precautions which may not be immediately apparent. Some of these gases 
may be generated in situ (e.g. diborane in hydroboration reactions), some may 
be commercially available in cylinders, and some may be generated by chemical 
or other means (e.g. carbon dioxide, ozone). An individual description of the 
convenient sources of these gases will be found under Section 4.2. 

For those gases which are generated in situ, no further points need be noted 
here as the apparatus is described in the appropriate section. 

For those gases which are available in cylinders, the manufacturer's notes 
about precautions against any hazards in their use should be carefully followed 
and the appropriate antidotes should be available for immediate use. It is im- 
portant to realise that cylinders of all gases are potentially very dangerous owing 
to the possibility of the valve being broken off should the cylinder be knocked 
over; cylinders must therefore always be securely strapped, or supported, in 
frames whether in storage or in use. Cylinders of toxic gases (e.g. chlorine, sul- 
phur dioxide) are often of such dimensions that they may be easily accommo- 
dated and suitably supported in an efficient fume cupboard containing the 
reaction apparatus. With the larger cylinders of toxic or hazardous gases (e.g. 
ammonia, acetylene) it is essential that these should be located on the laboratory 
wall outside the building and piped as appropriate through holes in the wall 
directly into the fume cupboard.* Cylinders so positioned should have suitable 
protection from the weather and should be easily accessible. Large cylinders of 
inert gases (e.g. nitrogen) should be supported in suitable stands. 

For gases which are generated by chemical or other means, it is essential that 
the flow of gas be maintained at as steady a rate as possible, by suitable control 
of the generating apparatus. Such apparatus should not be left unattended, even 
for a comparatively short space of time. 

The gases provided by the above sources should be led to the reaction vessel 
via a train of Drechsel bottles, suitably charged to effect prior drying or purifica- 
tion, and to provide a trap if 'sucking back' of the reaction mixture occurs (e.g. in 
the rapid uptake of hydrogen chloride). Should 'suck-back' occur the experi- 
ment is not then ruined, nor does the reaction mixture either cause a potential 
hazard with the chemicals in the generating apparatus, or cause irreparable 
damage to the cylinder valve. A suitable apparatus set-up is shown in Fig. 2.59, 
where it should be observed that the gas is released just under the surface of the 
reaction liquid by means of a glass tube fitted with a wide pore size glass frit; this 
improves gas-liquid contact and aids the absorption of the gaseous reactant, but

should not be used if a solid reaction product that may block the pores is likely 
to be formed. 

It is sometimes necessary (e.g. in reactions involving organolithium com- 
pounds or in certain Grignard preparations) to carry out a reaction in an atmo- 
sphere of an inert gas, such as nitrogen (see also Section 2.17.8, p. 120). A suitable 
set-up is shown in Fig. 2.60. Dry nitrogen is introduced at the top of the con- 
denser and initially can be allowed to sweep through the apparatus and escape 
at the mouth of the dropping funnel; it will be noted that the latter has a 
pressure-equalising side tube. After a few minutes the flow of inert gas may be 
reduced. The level of mercury (alternatively mineral oil or a high-boiling ester, 
e.g. dibutyl phthalate) in the escape valve should be such that a slight pressure of 
gas within the apparatus is maintained when the funnel is closed. This arrange- 
ment* is economical in nitrogen, obviates the evaporation of solvent and is to be 
preferred to the use of a continuous stream of inert gas. 

In some reactions a gas is evolved which may be of an irritant or corrosive 
nature (e.g. hydrogen chloride in Friedel-Crafts reactions, sulphur dioxide- 
hydrogen chloride in acid chloride preparations) and it is advisable to employ a 
suitable gas absorption trap. Either of the gas traps depicted in Fig. 2.61(a) and 
(b) are used when limited quantities of water-soluble gases are to be absorbed. 
For larger volumes of gas, or where the gas is rapidly evolved, the gas traps 
shown in Fig. 2.61(c) and (d) are very satisfactory. In (c) the gas is passed into a 
wide tube through which a stream of water (usually from a reflux condenser) 
flows into a large filter flask and overflows at constant level, which is above the 
lower end of the wide tube; a water seal is thus provided which prevents the 
escape of gas into the atmosphere, and the heat of solution of the gas is dissi- 
pated. A convenient size for (d) is a tube 80-100cm long and 25 mm diameter. 

A highly efficient gas-absorption apparatusf is depicted in Fig. 2.62. The 
overall length is about 40 cm; two inlets for obnoxious gases are provided, but

mercially available.

passes up the outer annulus, spraying out at the top of the tower on to 9 mm 
Raschig or similar rings. It then passes down the column and through the water 
trap at the bottom of the apparatus to waste through a side tube fitted with a 
siphon-breaking device. The contaminated gas enters at either side of the two 
inlet connections and is absorbed by the water passing down the column. 

2.16 PRECAUTIONS FOR UNATTENDED REACTIONS 

It is in the nature of organic reactions that quite frequently prolonged reaction 
times are necessary for their successful completion. Obviously a considerable 
saving in working time can be achieved if such a reaction can be left running 
unattended, and in particular overnight. Other prolonged operations include, 
for example, constant extraction with solvents (Section 2.22) and the elution of 
chromatographic columns (Section 2.31). For all these, essential services such as 
water (for cooling purposes) and electricity (for heating, stirring or for the 
operation of instruments) may have to be left on, and certain elementary but 
essential precautions are necessary to minimise the danger of damage due to fire 
or flood. In general it is desirable that the addition of all reactants should be 
completed before the reaction is left unattended overnight; once any obviously 
exothermic process has moderated the reaction can usually be safely left if neces- 
sary. 

The safest arrangement for dealing with the problem of overnight reactions, 
particularly those carried out on a fairly large scale, is to have available some 
form of simple shelter constructed of angle iron and heat-resistant sheeting fitted 



86 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



with power points and a water supply; this may be sited on any convenient flat 
area away from the laboratory building. Alternatively a small room fitted with 
efficient extractor fans and with an automatic fire extinguishing system, or even 
a large tiled fume cupboard kept free of extraneous apparatus, could be set aside 
for such reactions. Adequate provision must be made for drainage should flood- 
ing occur; in the event, for example, of condenser leads splitting and becoming 
unattached.* 

For reactions which merely require stirring without heating it is necessary to 
ensure that the stirrer shaft is rotating freely in a rigidly clamped stirrer guide to 
avoid the possibility of the stirrer breaking the reaction vessel. If a stirrer seal of 
the Kyrides type (Section 2.14) has to be used it must be well lubricated to avoid 
seizure. An electromagnetic stirrer can of course be used if the stirring it provides 
is adequate. Although modern shakers are designed so as to prevent the possibil- 
ity of their 'travelling' over a bench or floor surface, nevertheless it is advisable to 
take steps to prevent movement and to ensure that the moving parts cannot 
accidentally touch other apparatus in the vicinity, or move against a wall sur- 
face. 

The commonest operation which needs to be carried out during an overnight 
period is probably a reaction which requires heating under reflux, with or with- 
out stirring. Any form of gas heating is highly hazardous and electric heating 
mantles must be used; it is essential that the controls should be sited well away 
from the reaction assembly. Rubber tubing used for connecting reflux con- 
densers, etc., to the water supply should be inspected for latent defects and 
should be securely wired on to the taps and glass apparatus inlets and outlets. 
Waste water should be led away through a rubber tube which has fitted at its 
end a glass tube, which projects well into the main drain. Before the reaction is 
finally left, one should check that the cooling water is flowing freely but not vio- 
lently through all condensers. 

2.17 APPARATUS FOR SPECIAL REACTION TECHNIQUES 

2.17.1 CATALYTIC HYDROGENATION 

Many classes of organic compounds may be efficiently reduced by molecular 
hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst {catalytic hydrogenation). 24 
Depending upon the nature of the functional group which it is required to 
reduce, the experimental conditions necessary for hydrogenation may vary 
widely; for example, hydrogenation may be carried out either at room tempera- 
ture or at temperatures up to about 300 °C, with the use of hydrogen at atmo- 
spheric pressure or at pressures up to about 350 atmospheres. The successful 
hydrogenation of a particular functional group depends also upon the correct 
choice of a suitable catalyst, and a wide range of formulations is available for the 
preparation of catalysts in a suitably active form. The main commonly used 
catalyst preparations together with the functional groups which they most 
effectively reduce are discussed briefly below; their preparation is dealt with 

* A clear notice should be displayed near the apparatus indicating the type of reaction being carried 
out, the nature of the solvent (if any) being used, and whether the water and/or electricity supply is 
required to be left on. In certain cases it may be desirable to indicate what steps should be taken if 
any of the essential services fail. 

87 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



under Section 4.2. The nature of the solvent used may also influence the course 
of the hydrogenation. Acceptable solvents must not of course themselves be 
reduced under the hydrogenation conditions; cyclohexane, ethanol, acetic acid 
or ethyl acetate are widely used. Small quantities of acids or bases added to neu- 
tral solvents may have a significant effect on the course of some hydrogenations. 

HYDROGENATION CATALYSTS 

Platinum metal group. These are powerfully active catalysts which are used at 

normal or slightly elevated temperatures and pressures. 

Platinum in a finely divided form is obtained by the in situ reduction of hy- 
drated platinum dioxide (Adams catalyst); finely divided platinum may also be 
used supported on an inert carrier such as decolourising carbon. Finely divided 
palladium prepared by reduction of the chloride is usually referred to as palla- 
dium black. More active catalysts are obtained however when the palladium is 
deposited on decolourising carbon, barium or calcium carbonate, or barium sul- 
phate. Finely divided ruthenium and rhodium, usually supported on decolouris- 
ing carbon or alumina, may with advantage be used in place of platinum or 
palladium for some hydrogenation reactions. 

The platinum metal group of catalysts readily reduce most olefinic and 
acetylenic multiple bonds at normal temperatures and pressures. The selective 
semi-hydrogenation of an alkyne to an alkene is efficiently carried out using 
deactivated palladium catalysts (e.g. Lindlar's catalyst). The reduction of 
aliphatic aldehydes and ketones to alcohols is a little more difficult to achieve; 
palladium is virtually ineffective but platinum which has been promoted by the 
addition of a little iron(n) sulphate works well. On the other hand, aryl alde- 
hydes and ketones are readily reduced over palladium, but the products are the 
corresponding hydrocarbons rather than alcohols (i.e. hydrogenolysis of the 
intermediate alcohols, which are benzylic in nature, occurs). Such alcohols are 
best prepared using ruthenium, which does not promote hydrogenolysis. The 
platinum metal group are not the catalysts of choice for the reduction of 
aromatic ring systems, although ruthenium and rhodium are very effective, and 
Adams' catalyst in the presence of acetic acid may be used. This latter catalyst 
system is also useful for the reduction of pyridine rings; somewhat elevated pres- 
sures of hydrogen are used. An important use of deactivated palladium catalysts 
in the selective hydrogenolysis of acid chlorides to aldehydes (the Rosenmund 
procedure). 

Nickel. Nickel catalysts for hydrogenation can be prepared in a range of activ- 
ities (Raney nickel catalysts; see Section 4.2.50, p. 450). The most active grades 
are comparable with platinum and palladium in many of the reductions men- 
tioned above. The less active grades are frequently used however and usually re- 
quire moderate or high temperatures and pressures, depending upon the nature 
of the group which is to be reduced. These catalysts are particularly useful for 
the reduction of nitrogen-containing functional groups such as — N0 2 , 
— CsN, &gt; C=NOH to primary amines; nickel catalysts are not deactivated 
(poisoned) by amino compounds as are the platinum metal group. Nickel also 
effects hydrogenation of benzene rings; for catalysts of a moderate degree of 
activity, temperatures about 100 °C and pressures of about 100 atmospheres are 
usually adequate. An important application of Raney nickel, which is related to 
its insensitivity to the action of catalyst poisons, is in the reductive fission of 

88 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



C — S bonds, a process which is exploited in the desulphurisation of organic 
sulphur-containing compounds. 

Copper-chromium oxide. This is a catalyst of uncertain composition prepared 
by the ignition of basic copper(n) ammonium chromate. It is an approximately 
equimolar combination of copper(n) chromite and copper(n) oxide (CuCr 2 4 - 
CuO) but is evidently not a simple mixture of these two components. The cata- 
lytic activity is enhanced by the incorporation of some barium chromite; hydro- 
genations require however the use of relatively high temperatures and pressures. 
This catalyst, which may be regarded as complementary to Raney nickel, is 
generally useful for the reduction of oxygen-containing functions, and is the 
catalyst of choice for converting esters into primary alcohols. It may be used for 
the reduction of amides; it does not usually reduce an aromatic ring unless the 
conditions are exceptionally severe. 

APPARATUS FOR CATALYTIC HYDROGENATION 

The equipment described below presents potential hazards from the usage of 
hydrogen gas and of vessels maintained at pressures greater than atmospheric. 
All equipment should be located therefore in a suitably constructed laboratory 
(Section 2.3.2, p. 41). Furthermore the apparatus should be tested regularly for 
leaks (using an inert gas such as nitrogen), and in the case of pressure vessels 
inspected at appropriate intervals by a qualified engineer. 

Hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure: standard procedure. This method for 
effecting hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure employs the apparatus shown 
semi-diagrammatically in Fig. 2.63(a); it is supported on a suitable metal rod 
framework. The essential features are a long-necked hydrogenation flask A 
fitted to the apparatus with sufficient flexible tube to allow shaking, a series of 




Fig. 2.63(a) 



89 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



water-filled burettes and reservoirs (two are shown, B and C), a manometer D 
and mercury safety trap E. The size of the burettes will be appropriate to the 
scale of operation for which the apparatus is designed; a suitable combination of 
2 litre, 1 litre, 250 ml or 1 00 ml sizes may be used. The various parts of the appar- 
atus are connected as far as is possible by ground glass joints lubricated with 
Silicone grease. Flexible tubing in contact with hydrogen is of polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC); the hydrogenation flask should be screened by a laminated safety glass 
shield. No flames should be allowed in the laboratory while the hydrogenation 
apparatus is in use. 

The procedure for conducting the hydrogenation is as follows: 

1. Disconnect the hydrogenation flask A, open taps H, K and L, and fill the bur- 
ettes with water by raising the reservoirs. Close taps K and L and lower the 
reservoirs. 

2. Charge the hydrogenation flask with the catalyst, and with the solution to be 
hydrogenated, taking care that the solution washes down traces of catalyst 
which might be adhering to the sides of the flask so that finally all of the cata- 
lyst is covered by solution. Attach the flask to the apparatus. Connect the 
apparatus to a water pump via a trap (not shown) and the three-way tap F 
and attach a hydrogen cylinder to G via a reducing valve. 

3. Close tap M and evacuate the apparatus via tap F. 

4. Close tap F and fill the apparatus with hydrogen to atmospheric pressure, as 
indicated by the manometer D, by slowly opening tap M; close tap M. 

5. Re-evactuate the apparatus via tap F and then close tap F; repeat steps 4 and 
5 once more. 

6. Refill the apparatus with hydrogen via tap M, open taps K and L and allow 
the burettes to fill with hydrogen, if necessary lowering the reservoirs further. 
Close tap M. 

7. With taps K, L and H open, adjust the levels of water in the reservoirs to just 
above those in the burettes and momentarily open the three-way tap to the 
atmosphere so that the pressure of hydrogen in the system reaches atmo- 
spheric. Record the water levels in the burettes. Close tap L. 

8. Shake the flask A to initiate the hydrogenation, and adjust the reservoir of the 
burette B periodically so that the pressure of hydrogen is slightly above 
atmospheric. When the hydrogen in B is all used up, close tap K and open tap 
L to use the hydrogen in burette C. 

9. When hydrogen uptake ceases adjust the level of the reservoir for burette C 
and read the burette. Close tap L. 

10. Stop the shaker and swirl the flask manually to wash down below the surface 
of the solution all traces of catalyst which may be adhering to the sides of the 
flask and evacuate the apparatus via tap F. Admit air* through F and detach 
the hydrogenation flask. 

11. Correct the total volume of hydrogen used to standard temperature and 
pressure to determine the uptake in moles. 

12. Filter off the spent catalyst on a small Hirsch funnel and wash it with a little 
of the solvent. The damp used catalyst should be transferred immediately to a 
residues bottle for subsequent recovery (Sections 4.2.54 and 61, pp. 452 and 

* Provided that the catalyst is covered with solution there is little danger of an explosion occurring 
when air is admitted to the apparatus; however, it is wise to ensure that appropriate precautions 
have been taken.

459 respectively); used hydrogenation catalysts should not be allowed to 
become dry on the filter paper as they are liable to inflame. The filtrate should 
then be worked up in a manner appropriate to the nature of the product. 

The apparatus may be tested and the activity of the catalyst assessed by 
carrying out a hydrogenation of cinnamic acid (Expt 6.138) or maleic acid. The 
procedure for the latter is described below. 

Hydrogenation of maleic acid. Place 20 mg of Adams' platinum dioxide catalyst 
(Section 4.2.61, p. 459) in a hydrogenation flask, introduce a solution of 0.58 g 
(0.005 mol) of maleic acid in 15 ml of ethanol and attach the flask to the adapter 
of the atmospheric hydrogenation apparatus (Fig. 2.63(a)). Fill the flask and gas 
burettes with hydrogen by the procedure discussed above; note the volumes in 
the gas burettes and then gently agitate the flask contents by means of the 
shaker. When uptake of hydrogen ceases note the total volume of hydrogen 
absorbed; this should be in the region of 1 15 ml. Follow the procedure discussed 
above for replacing the hydrogen in the apparatus with air; disconnect the 
hydrogenation flask, filter off the catalyst and wash it with a little ethanol (do 
not allow the catalyst to become dry, but after the washing operation remove the 
filter paper and rinse the catalyst into the residues bottle with water). Evaporate 
the ethanol to leave a residue of succinic acid, 0.58 g, m.p. 184°C; the m.p. is un- 
affected after recrystallisation from 2.5 ml hot water. 

The Brown 2 hydrogenator. A convenient alternative procedure for carrying out 
atmospheric pressure hydrogenations involves the use of the Brown hydrogen- 
ator. 25 The design of apparatus found in many laboratories is of a standard 
assembly for the hydrogenation of about 1 to 100 g of material, or in a larger 
version for the hydrogenation of 100 to 1000 g. The procedure uses the reaction 
of acetic acid with sodium borohydride to provide a convenient source of pure 
hydrogen, and thus avoids the problems associated with the usage of hydrogen 
gas cylinders; the apparatus is designed to allow the automatic generation of the 
gas. The catalyst (usually a highly active form of platinum) is prepared in situ 
immediately before use by the reduction of the metal salt with sodium boro- 
hydride. 

The apparatus can be used in two ways: 

1. Where hydrogen is generated in one flask and hydrogenation of the substrate 
in the presence of the catalyst is effected in another ('external hydrogenation'). 

2. Where hydrogen generation and hydrogenation are effected in the same flask 
('internal hydrogenation'). 

External hydrogenation. The apparatus for this operation is shown in Fig. 
2.63(b). It consists basically of three glass vessels, a hydrogen generator A, a 
hydrogenation flask B and a pressure control bubbler C, which are connected in 
series by means of air-tight O-ring joints. 

The mercury bubbler C acts as a safety vent and controls the pressure in the 
apparatus. A ball valve near the top of the inlet tube prevents the mercury being 
sucked into flask B in the event of the automatic control valve D becoming 
blocked. 

The hydrogenation vessel B is an Erlenmeyer flask with a slightly convex 
base, which is attached by means of wire springs to the inlet adapter E which 
incorporates a port closed with a serum cap to allow the introduction of appro- 
priate solutions from a syringe. 

91 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




Fig. 2.63(6) 

The hydrogen generator flask A is a similarly shaped Erlenmeyer flask. The 
inlet adapter to which this flask is attached incorporates a mercury valve D 
which controls the rate at which the sodium borohydride solution contained in 
the 250 ml burette G is allowed to flow into the flask A via the syringe needle H 
(gauge 17 or 19) and the vent holes F in the control valve D. 

Efficient stirring in the flasks A and B is provided by means of suitably sized 
Teflon-covered magnetic followers fitted with half-inch Teflon collars; the mag- 
netic stirrer units serve also to further support the apparatus which should be 
securely clamped to a rack. 

The following stock solutions are required: 

Stabilised sodium borohydride solutions, (a) 1 .00 m Aqueous solution: dissolve 
0.8 g of sodium hydroxide in 150 ml of water, add 7.71 g of sodium borohydride 
(assuming 98% purity) and stir to dissolve. Dilute the solution to 200ml and 
filter, (b) 2.50 m Aqueous solution: repeat the procedure under (a) exactly but 
increasing the amount of sodium borohydride to 1 9.25 g. (c) 1 .00 m Ethanol solu- 
tion: dissolve 0.8 g of sodium hydroxide in 10 ml of water, dilute to 200 ml with 
absolute ethanol and add 7.71 g of sodium borohydride. Stir until solution is 
effected and filter. 

0.2 m Ethanolic chloroplatinic acid solution: dissolve 1 .00 g of chloroplatinic 
acid (40% platinum metal) in 10 ml of absolute ethanol. 

The procedure for conducting the hydrogenation of 0.5 mol of a compound is 
described below. (Flask sizes and reagent quantities suitable for the hydrogena- 
tion of other molar amounts of substrate are listed in Table 2.6.) 

CAUTION: All the following operations involving catalyst preparation and 
hydrogenation should be conducted in the fume cupboard; in particular, large quan- 
tities of hydrogen are evolved in step 2. 



92 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



1. Remove the flask B (500 ml capacity) from the apparatus assembly and 
add 100 ml of absolute ethanol, 5.0 ml of 0.2 m ethanolic chloroplatinic acid 
and 5 g of decolourising charcoal; insert a 38 mm Teflon-covered follower 
bar. 

2. Place the flask on a magnetic stirrer unit and stir vigorously while adding 
25 ml of 1.0 m ethanolic sodium boro hydride as rapidly as possible without 
allowing the contents of the flask to foam over. After about one minute, add 
20 ml of glacial acetic acid or concentrated hydrochloric acid to destroy 
excess of sodium borohydride. 

3. Add 0.5 mol of the compound to be hydrogenated either neat or in ethanolic 
solution and reconnect flask B to the apparatus but do not commence stir- 
ring. 

4. Charge the burette G with 1.00 m aqueous sodium borohydride solution. 

5. Place 20 ml of glacial acetic acid in flask A (250 ml capacity) equipped with a 
Teflon-covered follower bar. Reconnect flask A to the apparatus and stir 
magnetically whilst injecting from a syringe through the side port of the inlet 
adapter 30 ml of the aqueous sodium borohydride solution. The rate of addi- 
tion should be such as to effectively flush the apparatus with hydrogen with- 
out ejecting mercury from the bubbler C. 

6. Open the stopcock of burette G; the depth of mercury in the control valve D is 

sufficient to support the column of borohydride solution. Now begin vigor- 
ous magnetic stirring of the contents of flask B when hydrogenation will 
begin. As the pressure drops in the system the valve allows sodium boro- 
hydride solution to be drawn into flask A via the vent holes F and the syringe 
needle H (gauge 17). The hydrogenation will then continue automatically 
until it has been completed. Finally note the volume of sodium borohydride 
solution which has run in from the burette. 

7. Disconnect flask B, remove the catalyst by filtration and isolate the reduction 
product by suitable work-up procedures. 

8. Calculate the uptake of hydrogen from the recorded volume of sodium boro- 
hydride solution used. 

250 ml 1.00 m NaBH 4 = 1.00 mol H 2 

If the substrate is insoluble in ethanol or if it is sensitive to protic media 
another solvent must of course be used. Ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran or 
diglyme are suitable alternatives but not dimethylformamide or acetonitrile 
which poison the catalyst. If an alternative solvent is needed the catalyst is pre- 
pared in ethanol as in step 1 and 2, but the procedure thereafter is modified as 
follows. 

(a) Pour the contents of flask B into a sintered glass Buchner funnel, and 
remove most of the ethanol with gentle suction until the catalyst is left 
covered by an approximately 3 mm layer of the solvent. 

(b) Add 50 ml of ethanol to the catalyst in the funnel, stir with a spatula and 
remove most of the ethanol by suction as in (a). 

(c) Similarly wash the catalyst three times with 50 ml portions of the new sol- 
vent. The catalyst must not be allowed to become dry at any time during the 
above filtration procedure. 

(d) Wash the catalyst into the hydrogenation flask with 100ml of new solvent 
with the aid of a wash bottle. Continue with step 3 of the standard pro- 
cedure described above.

Internal hydrogenation. For this mode of operation the Erlenmeyer flask B and 
the inlet adapter E are omitted from the assembly shown in Fig. 2.63(b) and the 
pressure control bubbler C is connected directly to the inlet adapter fitted to 
flask A. Catalyst preparation, hydrogen generation and hydrogenation are all 
carried out in flask A. The procedure for the hydrogenation of 0.5 mol of a com- 
pound is described below; this may be modified for other molar quantities of 
substrate as indicated in Table 2.7. 

CAUTION: The entire operation should be conducted in the fume cupboard. 

1. Place 100 ml of absolute ethanol, 5.0 ml of 0.2 m ethanolic chloroplatinic acid 
and 5 g of decolourising charcoal in flask A (1000 ml capacity); insert a 38 mm 
Teflon-covered follower bar. 

2. Connect the flask to the inlet adapter and support it on a magnetic stirrer unit. 

3. Charge the burette G with 1.00 m ethanolic sodium boro hydride and stir the 
contents of the flask vigorously. To prepare the catalyst rapidly inject 40 ml of 
1.00 m ethanolic sodium borohydride solution through the inlet port by 
means of a syringe and after one minute inject 25 ml of glacial acetic acid to 
destroy excess sodium borohydride. 

CAUTION: A large volume of hydrogen is evolved. 

4. Open the stopcock of the burette, inject from a syringe through the inlet port 
0.5 mol of the compound to be hydrogenated as a liquid or as an ethanolic 
solution when hydrogenation will proceed automatically as in the external 
hydrogenation technique. 

5. At the conclusion of the hydrogenation, record the volume of sodium boro- 
hydride solution used, remove the catalyst by filtration and isolate the prod- 
uct by suitable work-up procedures. 

Hydrogenation under pressure. The following account refers primarily to com- 
mercial apparatus suitable for conducting hydrogenations under pressure; the 
apparatus can of course be employed for other reactions under pressure (Section 
2.17.2, p. 97), but some modifications of experimental procedure will then be 
necessary. 

The apparatus shown in the photograph (Fig. 2.63(c), Chas. W. Cook &amp; Sons 
Ltd) is designed for use at temperatures up to 70 °C and at working pressures up 
to 60p.s.i. when using a glass reaction bottle (available with a capacity of either 
500 ml or 1 litre). Stainless steel reaction bottles can be used at pressures up to 
300p.s.i. and if necessary at temperatures up to 200 °C. The bottle fits into an 
aluminium carrier fitted with an aluminium alloy cover carrying a sulphur-free 
rubber sealing ring. A metallic heating unit which surrounds the bottle is pro- 
vided; the lid is fitted with a thermocouple well which dips into the reaction 
bottle. The carrier is pivoted in a support frame to allow controlled rocking by a 
geared motor with an eccentric drive. The reaction bottle is connected by a flex- 
ible PTFE tube to a mild steel hydrogen reservoir with a capacity of 4.3 litres 
and which as normally supplied has a maximum operating pressure of 200p.s.i. 
(Reservoirs operating at pressures up to 500 p.s.i. for hydrogenations in stain- 
less steel reaction bottles are also available.) At the forward end a double valve 
provides for: (a) the evacuation of the bottle using a water pump; (b) the con- 
trolled charging of the bottle with hydrogen with the aid of a pressure gauge 
marked in pounds; and (c) the release of pressure in the bottle without loss of gas 
from the storage tank. The uptake of hydrogen may be computed from the 
change in pressure as the result of the hydrogenation.

2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




Fig. 2.63(c) 



A similar design of apparatus is available from Parr Instrument Co. Both 
manufacturers publish detailed instructions on the use of the equipment for 
carrying out a hydrogenation reaction. 

The essential features of an excellent high-pressure autoclave are illustrated 
in Fig. 2.63(d) (Baskerville and Lindsay). The special feature of this apparatus, 
constructed almost entirely of stainless steel, is the incorporation of a totally 
enclosed agitator in the form of a plunger which is operated electro-magnetically; 
agitation efficiency is at least as high as is achieved with shaking autoclaves and 
is very affective for hydrogenation purposes. The apparatus is stationary, has no 
external moving parts, and can be made compact and convenient to use. The 
reaction vessel B is made of F.M.B. stainless steel machined out of the solid and 
is provided with a cover fitted respectively with a thermometer or thermocouple 
pocket T, a central vertical tube, and an outer vessel nut with compression 
screws for making the pressure joint between the cover and the vessel. Sd is a 
solenoid operated through the contactor C, Bd is a bursting disc, G is a pressure 
gauge, V! is a control valve, V 2 is an evacuation valve (the last-named is con- 
nected through VP to a vacuum pump for complete evacuation of the appar- 
atus). The agitator A consists of a stainless steel rod at the lower end of which is 
secured a circular stainless steel plate; at the upper end of the rod passing 
through the centre of the vertical tube is a stainless steel sheathed armature 
which, in its lowest position, just enters the lower end of the solenoid coil sur- 
rounding the central tube. The solenoid Sd through the contactor C operates at 
a rate between 20 and 90 cycles per minute controlled by an adjustable screw on 
the contactor, resulting in a vertical reciprocating movement in the agitator rod. 
The whole autoclave is placed in an electrically heated air bath H. Autoclaves 
are available in capacities ranging from 20 ml to 2 litres for use with pressures up 
to 350 atmospheres and temperatures as high as 300 °C; special liners of Pyrex

High-pressure autoclaves are also available from Parr Instrument Co.; stir- 
ring is by turbine-type impellers. The reaction vessel is provided with a liquid- 
sampling valve which enables monitoring procedures. Both manufacturers 
provide detailed operating and servicing advice. 

2.17.2 REACTIONS UNDER PRESSURE 

Reactions which require the use of substantially increased pressures are usually 
carried out in a high-pressure metal autoclave. It should be emphasised again 
that these autoclaves should be isolated in a purpose-designed laboratory build- 
ing, and that inspection and testing should be carried out at appropriate inter- 
vals by a suitably qualified engineer. The apparatus described under 'Catalytic 
hydrogenation' (Section 2.17.1) is suitable for many reactions on a moderate 
scale, i.e. when the total volume of reactants is compatible with the size of the 
vessels available. Similar specially designed assemblies for small-scale reactions 
(volumes from 5 to 20 ml) are also available. Reactions involving corrosive 
materials require vessels provided with a resistant lining such as an acid- 
resisting enamel or Pyrex glass. 

A cheap and effective small-scale pressure vessel designed and constructed in 
the editors' laboratories is shown in Fig. 2.64(a). The main sections of the appar- 
atus are constructed from a high grade of stainless steel (EN 58J). The main

cylindrical vessel A has a raised thread (3 cm of thread of 3 mm pitch, Unified 
form) on the open end. The top section B fits tightly into A and the joint is sealed 
by a 'Viton' O ring, C; B is clamped firmly into place by the threaded collar D 
which is screwed home hand-tight on to A. A hole drilled through B leads to the 
'pop'-type safety valve E* and a threaded channel through B carries the adjust- 
able 'Hoke' valve F. 

To use the bomb, the vessel A is set in an upright position and charged with 
reactants and solvent; B is then pushed home into A with the valve F open and 
the securing collar D is screwed down hand-tight.f The vessel is evacuated with 
a vacuum pump attached to the nozzle of F, the valve is closed and the vacuum 
line removed. The bomb is then positioned behind adequate safety shielding, 
preferably in an isolated position, and heated in an oil bath or preferably by an 
electrical heating tape wound around the barrel A. 

On completion of the reaction, the bomb should be allowed to cool to room 
temperature and the barrel cooled further to about — 15 °C in an ice-salt or 
acetone-Cardice bath. The valve F may then be opened to release any pressure 
(fume cupboard), and the bomb dismantled and the contents removed for work- 
up. 

When one or more of the reactants is highly volatile the barrel A must be 
cooled thoroughly before the reactants are added. This may be achieved by 
standing A upright in an ice-salt or, if necessary, an acetone-Cardice bath. 
During cooling it is desirable to prevent the condensation of atmospheric mois- 

* This valve may be set to vent at various pressures by changing the strength of the internal spring; 
in this apparatus, the valve is set to about 300p.s.i. For insurance purposes, the vessel must be sub- 
jected to a hydrostatic pressure test under the supervision of a Chartered Engineer. The vessel de- 
scribed above was subjected to a pressure of 60 bar (70 kgf cm "" 2 ) at ambient temperature and at the 
maximum operating temperature (200 °C using a 'Viton' O-ring seal).

load on the thread.

ture on the inside surface of A by closing the opening of A with a rubber bung 
carrying a calcium chloride guard-tube. After cooling the bung is removed, the 
cold reactants and solvent are added, and the apparatus is quickly assembled 
and evacuated. 

When a reactant is a gas at room temperature (e.g. 1,3-butadiene, Expt 7.23) 
the following procedure, which should be conducted in the fume cupboard, may 
be adopted to liquefy and transfer it to the pre-cooled vessel A. The apparatus 
consists of a purpose built acetone-Cardice condenser Fig. 2.64(b) with a 34/35 
upper socket and a 24/29 cone at the lower end on to which is fitted a two- 
necked round-bottomed flask. The side-arm of the flask carries a screw cap 
adapter through which is passed a length of glass tubing so that it just protrudes 
into the flask. The length of the tube should be such that it can be repositioned 
with the end reaching to the bottom of the flask. The outlet of this tube is con- 
nected to a calcium chloride guard-tube via polyethylene tubing. 

Add a small quantity of an appropriate drying agent in granular form to the 
flask and grease the joints lightly and protect from the ingress of moisture by 
wrapping with absorbent cotton wool and sealing with adhesive tape. 

Charge the inner vessel of the condenser with acetone-Cardice, surround the 
flask with a cooling bath of acetone-Cardice, and allow the gaseous reagent to 
flow slowly through the condenser inlet from a preparative assembly or from a 
compressed gas cylinder. 

When sufficient reagent has been condensed in the flask, shut off the supply of 
gas and connect the condenser inlet to a supply of nitrogen. Loosen the screw 
cap slightly, push the glass tube to the bottom of the flask, and re-tighten the 
screw cap. Remove the drying tube and apply a slight pressure of nitrogen to the 
condenser inlet to drive the condensed reagent directly into the precooled pres- 
sure vessel A via the plastic tubing. The pressure vessel is then quickly sealed and 
evacuated. 

2.17.3 UNCATALYSED AND CATALYSED VAPOUR PHASE REACTIONS 

Thermal decompositions (pyrolyses) and catalysed reactions in the vapour 
phase are widely used large-scale industrial techniques. These vapour phase 
reactions often lead to more economic conversions than the smaller batchwise 
laboratory methods, because relatively inexpensive catalyst preparations (com- 
pared to the often expensive reagents required in laboratory procedures) may be 
used, and because the technique lends itself to automated continuous produc- 
tion. In undergraduate laboratory courses the technique has not achieved wide- 
spread use. The discussion below of the various apparatus designs, to meet a 
range of experimental conditions, may be regarded as an introduction to this 
topic. 

A number of research groups have explored vapour phase pyrolytic reactions 
using apparatus designs (available from, for example, Aldrich), which allow for 
controlled vapour flow (and hence heat contact time), under moderate to high 
vacuum conditions. These techniques enable preparative procedures to be de- 
veloped which involve the trapping of reaction intermediates (e.g. carbenes, 
nitrenes, arynes, etc.), and also the study of very short-lived species by the inter- 
facing of the pyrolysis unit with, for example, a mass spectrometer. This special- 
ist area has been comprehensively reviewed. 26 

Examples which are cited in the following experiments are the depolymerisa- 

99 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

tion of dicyclopentadiene to cyclopentadiene (Expt 7.24), the thermal de- 
composition (pyrolysis) of acetone to keten (Expt 5.140), the pyrolysis of 1,5- 
diacetoxypentane to 1,4-pentadiene (Expt 5.14), and the formation of symmet- 
rical and unsymmetrical ketones by reaction of carboxylic acid vapours with a 
manganese(n) oxide catalyst (Expts 5.92 and 5.93). In each case the apparatus 
incorporates a reservoir containing the reactant, a heated reaction chamber 
which may or may not contain a catalyst and into which reactant vapours are 
led, and a collection flask in which the product is trapped. In some cases provi- 
sion is made for separating the product from unchanged reactant and returning 
the latter to the reservoir for recycling. 

The simplest apparatus is that shown in Fig. 2.65(a) where decomposition of 
the reactant occurs at reflux temperature without the aid of a catalyst, the prod- 
ucts being more volatile than the reactant. This apparatus assembly uses the 
component parts of the vacuum drying pistol illustrated in Fig. 2.86. The reac- 
tant in the reservoir A is heated to gentle reflux by means of a heating mantle or 
oil bath. The vapour, which consists of product and reactant, passes into the 
chamber B, when the undecomposed reactant condenses on the finger C and 
returns to A; the more volatile product passes to the condenser D to collect 
in the receiver flask E. The liquid in the finger C must have a boiling point 
above that of the product but well below that of the reactant; it will boil and 
reflux during the progress of the experiment and hence boiling chips in C will be 
required. 

When higher temperatures for pyrolysis are required in an uncatalysed 
vapour phase reaction, the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2.65(b) could be used. 
This was originally designed for the pyrolysis of acetone vapour which when 
passed over a nichrome filament heated at 700-750 °C gives keten in yields 
exceeding 90 per cent. 

The construction of the filament will be apparent from the enlarged inset.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 




Fig. 2.65(6) 



About 350 cm of 24 gauge Nichrome wire* is formed into a tight spiral by wind- 
ing the wire round a glass rod 3 mm in diameter and stretching the coil so 
formed to a length of 70 cm. The filament is held in position on 1.5-cm-long 
platinum hooks A sealed into the Pyrex glass rod B which supports them. The 
three platinum hooks at the bottom of the rod are placed 120° apart; two 
platinum hooks support the filament at a distance of 1 1 cm above the lower end. 
The ends of the filament C are connected to tungsten leads by means of nickel or 
brass connectors D, 10 mm in length and 3.5 mm in internal diameter. The tung- 
sten leads (24 gauge) are sealed into the glass at the points E; the leads are 
insulated by means of 6 mm glass tubing F, which are held by a cork stopper G. 
If desired, the tungsten leads may be soldered immediately above the glass seal 
to copper wires (24 gauge) which are passed through the glass tubing F. The 
tungsten or copper wire leads are connected to the 240-250 volt a.c. mains 
through a variable transformer (Variac). 

All the glass in the apparatus is in Pyrex and connections are made by means 
of standard glass joints of appropriate size. Chamber H is constructed from a 
25-cm length of glass tubing of 70mm internal diameter; the joint J is 55/44. The 
connecting tube K is in 12-15 mm tubing, the side arm L is of 15 mm tubing; the 
condensers M and N are efficient double surface condensers, 50 cm and 90 cm 
long respectively (the sizes are not critical); O is a liquid trap, constructed of 
35 mm tubing and is 1 20 mm long, with side tube of 8 mm diameter; the stopcock 
is for the removal of liquid from the trap. 

The operation of the apparatus for the preparation of keten (1) is as follows. 
Acetone is placed in the flask which is heated in an electric mantle until the 
liquid gently refluxes from the condenser M. After a few minutes the U-tube 
attached to K will fill with acetone and this provides a liquid trap which ensures 
that all the acetone vapour passes through H. After heating under reflux for a

further five minutes to drive air from the chamber H, the filament current is 
switched on so that the filament C attains a dull red glow (700-750 °C). Keten is 
formed almost immediately and is allowed to pass directly via the three-way tap 
shown into the reaction flask (2). The apparatus requires little attention apart 
from occasionally removing the condensed acetone from the trap O. At the end 
of the run, the following operations must be carried out rapidly in this order, (i) 
remove the source of heat from the flask; (ii) turn off the filament current; and 
(iii) open the stopcock on O. 

Notes. ( 1 ) Keten is a poisonous gas having a toxicity comparable with phosgene; leaks from 
the apparatus, which must be contained in a fume cupboard, are recognised by a pungent 
odour resembling acetic anhydride. For this reason it is customary to attach a second 
receiver flask containing a compound which readily reacts with keten, e.g. aniline, to the 
other arm of the three-way stopcock. In this way when the reaction in the main flask is 
complete the keten gas may be diverted to the second receiver flask while the apparatus is 
switched off and allowed to cool. Escape to the atmosphere of keten is thereby avoided. 
(2) The yield of keten may be determined by weighing the acetanilide formed by pass- 
ing keten through excess aniline for a measured period of time. 

For pyrolyses which proceed best in a heated tube, which may with advant- 
age be packed with glass beads or with porcelain chips to increase the heated 
surface area, and for reactions which occur on the surface of a heated catalyst, 
the basic apparatus shown in Fig. 2.65(c) is often suitable. A pressure-equalising

funnel A allows the reactant or reactants to be dropped at a constant rate into 
the combustion tube B, which is about 100 cm long and made of Pyrex tube 
(23 mm outer diameter and 16 mm inner diameter) and contains either glass 
beads or a suitable catalyst. Frequently it is necessary to conduct the reaction in 
the absence of air, and the adapter with T-connection C provides a means of dis- 
placing the air in the apparatus with nitrogen and of sweeping the products of 
the reaction through the combustion tube into the condenser and thence to the 
collection flask D. C also provides the means of introducing a gaseous reactant 
into the combustion tube should this be required. The Drechsel bottles E may 
serve a number of different purposes according to the nature of the experiment; 
for example: (a) they may monitor the flow of nitrogen gas from the inlet C; (b) 
they may be used to check the complete displacement of air from the apparatus 
by using Fieser's solution (Section 4.2.52, p. 452); and (c) they may be used to 
absorb unwanted gaseous products to prevent contamination of the atmo- 
sphere. The tube is heated by a furnace (F) (e.g. from Aldrich), or by a custom- 
built thermally insulated heated jacket (e.g. from Electrothermal Enginering, or 
Glas-Col). 

GENERAL PROCEDURE FOR OPERATION 

The combustion tube B is packed with glass beads or catalyst held in position 
with plugs of glass wool, and inserted centrally into the furnace. After fitting the 
remaining apparatus components, the air in the apparatus is displaced with 
nitrogen, the furnace is allowed to heat to the required temperature, and the 
combustion tube is allowed to reach temperature equilibrium. In those cases 
where the catalyst requires heat treatment (as in the case of manganese(n) car- 
bonate on pumice) adequate time must be allowed for the activation process to 
reach completion. The reactant is then allowed to drop into the combustion 
tube (the flow of nitrogen must be stopped if the rate of formation of gaseous 
products is to be observed) at a rate of about one drop every 3-4 seconds. The 
apparatus subsequently requires little attention and the passage of say 750 ml of 
reactant requires a period of addition of between 48 and 72 hours. 

The isolation and purification of the reaction products which collect in D will 
of course be determined by their chemical nature, and details are given in the 
appropriate sections. 

In some cases a single pass of reactants through the combustion tube gives 
only a low conversion into products and hence it is necessary to provide a means 
of recycling unreacted material while continuously removing product to avoid 
its decomposition. Some adaption to the above apparatus is then required and 
one such assembly is shown in Fig. 2.65(d). The reactant is heated in the flask A 
and the vapour passes upwards through the combustion tube B; the reactant 
and products are swept by a slow nitrogen flow into the Vigreux fractionating 
column. Unreacted material is collected in the Dean and Stark side tube, and 
returned as appropriate to the flask A. The Vigreux column is surmounted by a 
still head fitted with a condenser and collector flask. 

2.17.4 0Z0N0LYSIS 

The cleavage of a carbon-carbon double bond by oxidation with ozone (as 
ozonised oxygen) followed by hydrolysis to yield carbonyl compounds is a reac- 
tion sequence of considerable importance. This reaction, for example, can be 

103 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



used for the determination of the structure of an unsaturated compound by 
identification of the carbonyl fragments, or it may be used in suitable cases for 
the preparation of aldehydes or ketones which are not readily available by other 
means. Ozonisation of carbon-carbon multiple bonds, unlike oxidation with 
excess potassium permanganate or chromic acid which for example will also 
oxidise primary and secondary alcohols, is a relatively specific process. 

When ozonised oxygen is passed through a solution of an ethylenic com- 
pound in an inert solvent (e.g. methanol, ethyl acetate, glacial acetic acid, 
chloroform or hexane) preferably at a low temperature ( — 20 to — 30 °C), ozone 
adds on readily and quantitatively to the double bond to give an ozonide (1):

(1) (2) (3) 

Excess ozone should be avoided since further oxidation may occur. Conveni- 
ently a wash bottle charged with potassium iodide solution and acetic acid is 
attached to the outlet of the reaction vessel; the completion of ozonolysis is indi- 
cated by the sudden extensive separation of iodine. Alternatively the flow of 
ozonised oxygen may be interrupted, and a drop of the solution removed and 
placed upon a white porcelain tile and allowed to mix with a drop of tetranitro- 
methane when the production of a yellow coloration is indicative of the presence 
of unreacted alkene. 

The ozonides are usually not isolated since they are generally viscid oils or 
glasses, frequently with violently explosive properties, particularly upon warming. 
They can however, be smoothly converted into carbonyl compounds (2) and (3) 
by hydrolysis, preferably under reducing conditions (e.g. zinc dust and aqueous 
acetic acid), by hydrogenation over platinium on calcium carbonate or by treat- 
ment with dimethyl sulphide or thiourea. (Section 5.7.3, p. 592.) These con- 
ditions prevent the further oxidation (by the hydrogen peroxide formed during 
hydrolysis) of any aldehydic products to the corresponding carboxylic acids; if 
the acids are in fact the desired products, the decomposition of the ozonides may 
be carried out oxidatively, e.g. in the presence of hydrogen peroxide or potas- 
sium permanganate. 

A simple semimicro laboratory ozoniser is illustrated in Fig. 2.66; this gives 
reasonably satisfactory results for small quantities (2-4 g) of organic com- 
pounds. It consists of a wash bottle or small bubbler A to indicate the rate of 
flow of the oxygen from a cylinder fitted with a reducing valve, a Berthelot tube 
B for the generation of ozone, a vessel C to hold the solution of the compound to 
be ozonised, and a flask D containing 5 per cent potassium iodide in aqueous 
acetic acid. Since ozone is markedly toxic and is also a lung irritant the outlet 
from D should be led by means of PVC tubing to the extraction vent of the fume 
cupboard. The Berthelot tube is charged with dilute copper(n) sulphate solution 
and is connected by a copper or stainless steel wire (2-4 mm in diameter) to the 
high voltage terminal of a transformer (7500-1 0000 volts). The second electrode 
is the earthed aluminium foil covering most of the exterior of the Berthelot tube 
and is bound with insulating tape. As a precaution all high-voltage connections 
are heavily insulated with rubber tape and the lead to the top of the electrode is 
covered with PVC or equivalent tubing. The main dimensions are shown in the

figure. The ozoniser should be constructed of soft soda-glass tubing (Pyrex glass 
is unsatisfactory): the glass should be thoroughly cleaned and the annular space 
through which the oxygen passes should be as uniform as possible. The complete 
apparatus should be placed in a fume cupboard behind a shatter-proof screen of 
laminated safety glass. 

Commercially available ozonisers (e.g. from UVP International) use either 
air or oxygen and are capable of yielding about 0.005 mol 3 /hour (with air) or 
0.5 mol 3 /hour (with oxygen). A commercial ozoniser may be incorporated, by 
means of PVC tubing, in place of the Berthelot tube on an apparatus assembly 
similar to that above. 

Should it be necessary to estimate the amount of ozone produced by the 
ozone generator, the vessel C is charged with 50 ml of a 5 per cent solution of 
potassium iodide in aqueous acetic acid (1:1 v/v) and the ozonised oxygen 
allowed to pass for a set period, say 1 hour, at a steady and measured flow rate 
(e.g. bubbles/second counted by means of the bubbler A). The iodine which is 
liberated is determined by washing the contents of C into a conical flask and 
titrating the liberated iodine with 0.1 m sodium thiosulphate solution; the yield 
of ozone may be calculated in mol/hour for the particular flow rate selected.

On completion of the ozonisation of the olefinic material the method of de- 
composition of the resulting ozonide and the subsequent work-up procedure 
will be determined by whether the object of the reaction is preparative in nature, 
or whether it is required to identify the carbonyl compounds produced as an aid 
to the determination of the structure of the alkene. 

In the latter case the following procedure is recommended. Wash the contents 
of the reaction vessel into a round-bottomed flask, add zinc dust and acetic acid 
and fit the flask with a steam distillation assembly (Section 2.25) ensuring that 



105 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the receiver adapter outlet is just below the surface of an aqueous acidic solution 
of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (p. 1218) contained in a conical flask. Steam distil 
the solution and collect the volatile carbonyl compounds until no further precip- 
itate of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone is observed with fresh portions of reagent. 
Extract the combined distillate-reagent solutions with dichloromethane, dry 
and evaporate the extract, dissolve the residue in a little toluene and chromato- 
graph the solution on a column of alumina using toluene as the developing sol- 
vent. Evaporate the eluate and characterise the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone 
derivative. Extract the residual liquors from the steam distillation with ether or 
dichloromethane, wash, dry, evaporate and convert the residue into a 2,4- 
dinitrophenylhydrazone derivative for examination in a similar manner. 

When ozonolysis of the olefinic material is to be carried out for preparative 
purposes, the initial ozonisation should be conducted in dry methanol and the 
ozonide decomposed by hydrogenation over palladium hydroxide on calcium 
carbonate in the following manner. Rinse the contents of the reaction vessel with 
methanol into the hydrogenation flask containing palladium hydroxide on cal- 
cium carbonate catalyst (see Section 4.2.54, p. 452) and a magnetic stirrer fol- 
lower (Section 2.14), attach the flask to the hydrogenation apparatus (Fig. 
2.63(a)) and immerse the hydrogenation flask in an ice bath placed upon a mag- 
netic stirrer plate. This cooling is essential to avoid an undue rise in temperature 
of the solution during hydrogenation, which is exothermic, since this may lead 
to the alternative formation of a carboxylic acid at the expense of aldehyde. 
Charge the apparatus with hydrogen and hydrogenate the solution as detailed 
in Section 2.17.1, p. 89. Emphasis should be placed upon the importance of 
placing the hydrogenation vessel behind appropriate shatter-proof screens. 
When hydrogenation is complete, filter off the catalyst, remove the solvent on a 
rotary evaporator, and purify the product by crystallisation or distillation as 
appropriate. 

2.17.5 ORGANIC PHOTOCHEMISTRY 

Although it has long been recognised that chemical change can be effected by 
means of ultraviolet (200-400 nm) and visible light (400-750 nm), studies in this 
area of chemistry have until quite recently been largely the province of the phys- 
ical chemist. However, a rapidly increasing number of investigations since 1960 
have shown that many novel and synthetically useful reactions including dimeri- 
sation, cycloaddition, rearrangement, oxidation, reduction, substitution and 
elimination may be consequent upon the absorption of light by organic mole- 
cules. Many chemical transformations can be effected which would otherwise re- 
quire a large number of steps by standard chemical procedures. This progress in 
synthetic organic photochemistry has been aided by the commercial develop- 
ment of suitable light sources, by advances in procedures available for the 
separation and identification of the components of mixtures and, not least, by 
the realisation that many photochemical reactions occur quite cleanly to give 
good yields of the desired product. In addition the photochemical experiments 
can often be carried out much more simply than many standard chemical reac- 
tions. 

An understanding of organic photochemistry requires a knowledge of the 
energy transitions which a molecule may undergo following irradiation with 
electromagnetic radiation. Some consideration of these energy transitions is 

106 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



given in Chapter 3 in relation to the use of u.v. and i.r. spectroscopy in structural 
elucidation. The following account is intended to provide sufficient theoretical 
background to allow some appreciation of photochemical reactions, of which 
illustrative practical examples are given in Expts 5.36 and 7.24. A detailed treat- 
ment of photochemical processes may be found in a number of recent books on 
photochemistry. 27 

The total energy of a molecule is the sum of its electronic, vibrational, rota- 
tional and translational energies. Whereas the translation energy increases con- 
tinuously with the temperature of the system, the first three energy states are 
quantised and excitation to higher energy levels requires the absorption of dis- 
crete amounts of energy (quanta) which can be supplied by electromagnetic 
radiation. The amount of energy associated with such radiation depends on its 
wavelength, the longer the wavelength the smaller the energy (p. 385). Excitation 
of a molecule to higher rotational and vibrational energy levels can thus occur 
on absorption of radiation in the far infrared, and in the infrared regions of the 
spectrum respectively (i.e. the low energy portion of the spectrum), and is asso- 
ciated with relatively small increases in the energy of the molecule (~ 0.5 — 
42 kJ mol" '). Absorption of ultraviolet (200-400 nm) and visible (400-700 nm) 
radiation by a molecule is associated with an increase in energy in the range 
600-160 kJ mol" ' and results in the excitation of its valence electrons to higher 
energy levels. The energy associated with a photon of radiation in the ultraviolet 
region is of the same order as the bond energies of many of the bonds present in 
organic molecules (e.g. C-H, 410kJ mol -1 ). It is thus not surprising that 
absorption of light in this region can result in chemical reactions and that the 
reactions of molecules in such electronically excited states are often quite novel. 

Excitation of a molecule to a higher energy level involves promotion of an 
electron from a bonding (&lt;r or n) or a non-bonding (n) orbital to an antibonding 
(&lt;r* or 7c*) orbital. Four types of transitions are possible and the energy asso- 
ciated with each (which can be represented diagrammatically in Fig. 2.67(a)) de- 
creases in the order a -* a* &gt; n -* a* &gt; n -* n* « n -* n*. 

The &lt;r -&gt; a* and n -&gt; &lt;r* transitions are of little signficance in organic photo- 
chemical synthesis as they occur in the far ultraviolet ( &lt; 200 nm), a region which 
is not readily accessible practically owing to the absorption of radiation in this 
region by oxygen. The n -&gt; n* and n — ► n* transitions occur in the ultraviolet 
region and are responsible for the vast majority of useful photochemical reac- 
tions; in simple ketones the n -&gt; n* transition occurs at ~ 270 nm with an asso- 
ciated energy of 443.1 kJ mol" ', and the n -&gt; n* transition of butadiene occurs 
at217nm with an associated energy of 55 1.5 kJ mol" 1 . While the overall magni- 
tude of the energy required to effect these electron transitions explains why 
bonds may be broken during irradiation, a more detailed consideration of these 
electronically excited states is necessary to understand the various possible ways 
in which energy absorbed may be dissipated. In particular the importance of the 
concept of singlet and triplet states must be considered. 

Most organic molecules have an even number of electrons and these are 
paired (spins in opposite direction); energy states with paired electrons are 
called singlet (S) states (no net electronic magnetic moment and hence only one 
possible energy state in a magnetic field). The ground state of a molecule is 
referred to as S and the higher excited singlet states as S,, S 2 , S 3 , etc. Inversion 
of the spin of one electron results in the formation of a different electronic state 
having two unpaired electrons (same spin); this is referred to as a triplet (T) state

(a net electronic magnetic moment and hence three possible energy states in a

transitions between states of the same multiplicity are allowed whereas transi- 
tions between states of different multiplicity are formally forbidden. The ground 
state and lowest singlet and triplet states are represented schematically in Fig. 
2.67(b). 

Following the absorption of radiation and the promotion of an electron (7c or 
n) to the vibrationally excited single state S,f (which occurs very rapidly in 
~ 10" 15 s, the dissipation of this energy may take place in a variety of ways 
itemised below, some of which may be represented diagrammatically by means 
of a Jablonski diagram (Fig. 2.67(c)). 

1. Initially excess vibrational energy is rapidly lost by radiationless processes, 
such as collision with solvent molecules, to give the thermally equilibrated 
excited singlet molecules S,. This has a short lifetime (~ 10" 8 s) and may then 
lose its energy by any of the processes 2-5 below. 

t Absorption of sufficient energy can also cause excitation to higher singlet states such as S 2 ; how- 
ever, these generally decay very rapidly by radiationless transitions to the highest vibrationally 
excited state Si. This is possible since the S and Sj states are separated by the greatest energy gap, 
whereas the higher energy states have progressively smaller energy differences and overlapping 
potential energy surfaces which allow radiationless loss of energy. In certain cases the energy input 
may of course by sufficient to cause immediate bond dissociation.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



2. Emission of light from the excited molecule may occur which then returns to 
the ground state, i.e. fluorescence is observed. 

3. Thermal dissipation of the energy to surrounding molecules may occur; this is 

a radiationless process (internal conversion). 

4. Chemical reaction can occur. 

5. Conversion to the lower energy triplet (T,) by spin inversion {inter system 
crossing); although formally forbidden this can occur with very high efficiency 
when the energy difference between the two states is small. It is most notable 
in carbonyl and aromatic compounds (e.g. intersystem crossing occurs with 
100 per cent efficiency in the case of benzophenone). 

An excited molecule in the triplet state also has a number of ways in which its 
energy may be dissipated. 

1'. Emission of light from the excited molecule may occur with return to the 
ground state, but at longer wavelength than fluorescence, i.e. phosphores- 
cence is observed. Although this transition is formally forbidden, as spin 
inversion is involved, it does eventually occur with the important con- 
sequence that the T x state has a very much longer lifetime (10" 6 s -&gt; several 
seconds) than the S, state. 

2'. The species may decay by internal conversion. 

3'. Chemical reaction may occur - the longer lifetime of the triplet state com- 
pared to the Si state means that chemical reaction is a much more important 
feature, and is of prime importance in synthetic photochemistry. 

4'. Energy transfer to a neighbouring (different) molecule may occur so that the 
acceptor molecule is promoted to a triplet state of either equal or lower 
energy than the donor triplet species, which itself undergoes spin inversion 
and returns to the ground state S . Such a transfer will occur only if the 
acceptor molecule has an available lower energy excited level. 

There are two types of photochemical processes which lead to these various 
transitions and thence to a realisation of the synthetic possibilities of the pro- 
cesses 4 and 3' above. 

(a) Direct photolysis - where the incident radiation is directly absorbed by a 
substrate X, which is thus promoted to the excited singlet state X* which 
then loses its energy by the processes outlined above. 

X h " &gt; X* *■ product(s), etc. 

(b) Indirect or sensitised photolysis - where a photo-excited donor molecule 
(D*)in the singlet or triplet state, referred to as a sensitiser and produced by 
absorption of the incident radiation, transfers its energy to the substrate X 
which is thereby promoted to an excited state (e.g. see 4' above). In this pro- 
cess the sensitiser returns to the ground state, is chemically unchanged, and 
may be further excited by incident radiation.

ence between the two states is large. However, provided that the energy of the 
triplet state of the sensitiser molecule is about 20.9 kJ mol " ' greater than that of 
the triplet state of the substrate, energy may be transferred to provide excited 
molecules in the triplet state which may then undergo chemical reaction. The 
procedure is also useful for populating triplet states of a compound whose 
singlet state is in an inaccessible part of the ultraviolet spectrum (i.e. 
&lt; 200 nm).* This sensitising process is represented schematically in Fig. 2.67(d). 

PHOTOCHEMICAL APPARATUS AND EXPERIMENTAL 
PROCEDURES 

Prior to a study of the possible photochemical reaction of a compound, its spec- 
trum in the ultraviolet or visible region must be determined in order that a light 
source emitting the appropriate wavelength of radiant energy may be selected. 
In the case of a sensitised photochemical reaction the spectrum of the sensitiser 
should be determined. 

Light sources. In early photochemical work sunlight was the source of radiant 
energy, and it still remains a useful and cheap source in favourable climates for 
reactions requiring irradiation at wavelengths down to 320 nm. Ordinary high 
wattage tungsten lamps may also be used for reactions proceeding under the in- 
fluence of visible light. However, photochemical reactions on a preparative scale 
are most often effected with radiant energy of wavelength 220-380 nm, and for 
these purposes mercury arc lamps are used almost exclusively. There are essen- 
tially three types available. 

1. Low-pressure mercury arc lamps, which operate at a mercury vapour pressure 
of about 10" 3 mmHg and emit mainly at 254 nm and 184nm (about 80-95 
per cent of this radiation is produced at 254 nm). Low-pressure mercury arc 
lamps with phosphor coatings on the interior walls are available which give 
maximum light emission at longer wavelengths over broad selected regions, 
e.g. centring at 300 nm or 350 nm. 

2. Medium-pressure mercury arc lamps, which operate at internal pressures of 
from 1 to 10 atmospheres and emit radiation over the region 200-1400 nm, 
with particularly intense emission at 313 nm, 366 nm, 435.8 nm and 546.1 nm. 

* Triplet and singlet excited state energy values for a large number of substances have recently been 
collected. 28 

110 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



3. High-pressure mercury arc lamps, which operate at internal pressures of from 
100 to several hundred atmospheres and give almost continuous emission 
over the whole spectrum from about 200-1400 nm. The radiant energy is par- 
ticularly rich in visible light. 

Low-pressure mercury arc lamps operate at near room temperature. Much 
of the energy input of medium and especially high-pressure lamps however is 
converted into heat so that these lamps must be cooled. The medium-pressure 
lamps have been used most extensively for synthetic work on account of their 
high light output, ease of handling and broad spectrum emission. The full arc 
spectrum of these lamps is often employed in preparative photochemistry, but if 
necessary removal of unwanted regions of the spectrum can be effected by sur- 
rounding the lamp with chemical or glass (e.g. Corex, Vycor) niters; unwanted 
light below 300 nm can of course be removed by irradiation through Pyrex glass. 
For a comprehensive account of light niters and commercially available lamps, 
the reader should consult the monograph of Schonberg, Schenck and 
Neumuller. 29 Details of the energy output at the emitted wavelengths can 
usually be obtained from the lamp suppliers but it should be appreciated that 
these values change on ageing. 

The vast majority of photochemical syntheses have been conducted in the 
liquid phase, hence the apparatus assembly for a photochemical reaction must 
take into account the light transmission characteristics of the material from 
which the reaction vessels are made. Pyrex glass transmits most of the incident 
light above about 300 nm and may be used in the construction of apparatus for 
reactions which require light above this wavelength. Quartz vessels, transparent 
down to 200 nm, must be used for reactions which require light below 300 nm. 
Certain types of quartz allow transmission below 200 nm. 

There are basically two assemblies for carrying out preparative photo- 
chemical syntheses. The light source may either be placed outside the vessel con- 
taining the solution of substrate (external irradiation), or it may be placed inside 
the vessel containing the solution (internal irradiation); in this latter case the 
solution is subjected to the full output of the lamp and therefore this is to be pre- 
ferred. Both assemblies are available commercially from Hanovia Lamps Ltd for 
internal irradiation in reactor sizes of 1 and 10 litres; this manufacturer also sup- 
plies the 'Reading' photochemical reactor which is designed for external irradi- 
ation. Apparatus designed for preparative photochemistry is also available from 
Applied Photophysics Ltd, and the Southern New England Ultraviolet Co. A 
convenient apparatus for internal irradiation which has been used in these 
laboratories will be described and is shown diagrammatically in Fig. 2.67(e). The 
apparatus consists of a three-necked Pyrex reaction flask of approximately 
1 litre capacity with a central 45/50 socket to which is fitted the light source unit. 
The two side-necks of the flask allow the flushing of the reaction mixture with 
nitrogen and the attachment of a reflux condenser and/or a protective drying 
tube; the reactants are stirred magnetically. The light source unit has an outer 
quartz jacket A, an inner quartz jacket B and a mercury arc lamp C. Both 
jackets are made of fused quartz and each has a 75-mm-long zone made from 
pure synthetic quartz sited opposite the light-emitting region of the arc lamp; 
these zones allow about 80 per cent light transmission for every 1 mm thickness 
of quartz. Cooling water or air may be passed through the annular space 
between the two jackets via the inlet tube D and outlet tube E which are built 

111 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

into the inner jacket. Similar jackets are available in Pyrex for reactions which 
proceed on irradiation above 300 nm. 

The arc lamp C is attached by metal clips to the hollow support tube F which 
also allows flushing of the lamp area by nitrogen via inlet G and outlet H- The 
support tube F, the electrical leads to the arc lamp (not shown) and terminals for 
the cable from the power control unit (also not shown) are all attached to the 
terminal block J which is fitted with an insulating cover. The terminal block is 
attached to the inner quartz jacket by means of a rubber sleeve K and two sleeve 
clips, so that all the live parts are protected. The lamp and inner quartz jacket B 
can be withdrawn from the 40/38 socket attached to the outer quartz jacket A 
shown, and the entire unit can be withdrawn from the central socket of the reac- 
tion flask. 

Two mercury arc lamps with associated power units are available: (a) a 2 watt 
low-pressure U-shaped lamp which emits mainly at 186 nm and 254 nm, and {b) 
a 100 watt medium-pressure straight-tube lamp emitting predominantly at 
254 nm, 265 nm, 297 nm, 313 nm and 366 nm with intense emission also in the 
visible region; both lamps have synthetic quartz envelopes. 

Water cooling via D and E is essential with the medium-pressure lamp 
whereas with the low-pressure lamp gas cooling is usually sufficient. The latter 
may be conveniently effected by drawing filtered air through the annular space 
between the jackets by connecting H to a water pump, which should be situated 
in the fume cupboard in order to vent any ozone formed. Light-filter solutions 
may replace the cooling water if it is required to remove any particular regions 
of light emission, and these must of course be circulated and cooled in an 
arrangement external to the apparatus. 

Both lamps generate ozone and oxides of nitrogen in air, hence the inner 
lamp area should be flushed slowly with nitrogen via G and H as described 
above. It should be noted however that low-pressure lamps give maximum light 
output at a wall temperature of 40 °C so excessive cooling in the lamp region is 



112 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



to be avoided; this is particularly important when flushing with gas from a 
cylinder as the gas is likely to be cold due to expansion. In addition, it is of 
course essential that only dry gas be used because of the live connections in this 
region. 

Reactor vessels may readily be constructed to cater for smaller volumes of 
reactants. Figure 2.67(f) shows such a vessel having a capacity of about 110 ml. 
The outer quartz jacket A of the light source unit (Fig. 2.67(e)) fits into the 45/40 
centre socket, a reflux condenser and/or drying tube may be attached to one of 
the side 14/23 sockets while the other allows nitrogen flushing via the Teflon 
tube M attached to the drawn-out cone. Stirring is by means of the magnetic fol- 
lower bar N. Even smaller volumes may be accommodated by taping suitably 
sized tubes to the side of the outer jacket A of the light source unit and surround- 
ing the whole with aluminium foil. 

A number of important aspects should be borne in mind when planning and 
executing a photochemical synthesis and these are outlined below. 

1 . Safety. Ultraviolet light is extremely dangerous to the eyes and also harm- 
ful to the skin so that proper precautions must be taken when conducting a 
photochemical experiment (see Section 2.3.6, p. 52). Ideally the apparatus as- 
sembly should be situated in the fume cupboard and aluminium foil wrapped 
around the reaction vessel (which also additionally serves as a light reflector) 
when using an internal irradiation arrangement; the whole should be sur- 
rounded by a light shield made from board. Rubber tubes for cooling water 
should be wired on and a suitable cut-out device for the lamp incorporated into 
the circuit. This latter precaution is essential in case the water supply should fail 
since the heat generated by a medium-pressure lamp could lead to fracture of the 
apparatus, loss of material and possibly fire when flammable solvents are used. 
Suitable precautions should also be observed with regard to the electrical equip- 
ment. 

2. Degassing. Dissolved oxygen should normally be removed by passing 
nitrogen or other inert gas through the reaction solution for about 0.5 hour 
prior to irradiation and a nitrogen atmosphere should be maintained through- 
out the experiment. 

3. Stirring. Relatively concentrated solutions are often used in preparative 
photochemistry and in consequence most of the light is absorbed by a very thin 
layer of solution adjacent to the lamp. Some appreciation of this fact may be 
obtained from the following. Consider a 0.1 cm layer of a 0.01 m solution of a 
compound having a molar absorptivity (e) of 1000/ mol" 1 cm" 1 . From the 
Beer-Lambert Law, p. 385, the light energy (/) transmitted through this layer is 
given by the expression: 

. _ ^o ^o A) 

* 1Q£C&lt; iqI 000x0.01 xO.l 1Q 

where I is the intensity of the incident radiation, c is the molar concentration of 
the compound and / the length of the absorbing solution in centimetres. Thus it 
can be seen that 90 per cent of the light is absorbed in this 0.1 cm layer of solu- 
tion; vigorous stirring is therefore essential to change this layer continually. For 
volumes up to 1 litre this can usually be effected adequately by magnetic stirring. 
Stirring may also be effected by means of nitrogen introduced through a 
medium porosity fritted glass plate sealed to the bottom of the gas inlet tube; this 

113 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



is particularly useful with small volumes of reactants. It is important, using in- 
ternal irradiation with equipment such as described above, that the solution 
level should be above the light -emitting region of the lamp. 

4. Time of reaction. A measure of the efficiency of a photochemical synthesis is 
given by the quantum yield (&lt;/&gt;) for the product, which is denned as: 

number of molecules of product formed 

(p = 

number of quanta absorbed 

Quantum yields for reactions which proceed by way of a free radical chain 
mechanism may be as high as many thousands, whereas reactions which do not 
occur through such a mechanism have quantum yields in the region 0-1. Thus a 
knowledge of &lt;f&gt;, and the number of useful quanta emitted per second by the 
lamp, could allow calculation of the approximate time of photolysis. However, 
since these values are often not known it is usual to monitor the progress of the 
reaction, e.g. by using a suitable chromatographic procedure (Section 2.31), or 
by noting the disappearance of a characteristic absorption band in the u.v. spec- 
trum of the starting material. 

Depending on the concentration of the substrate(s) the reaction time required 
may be of the order of days rather than hours. This can often of course be 
shortened by irradiating with a higher-intensity lamp; 500-watt medium- 
pressure lamps are commonly used. 

To ensure as rapid a reaction as possible it is essential that all light- 
transmitting surfaces are kept absolutely clean, and handling of the quartz en- 
velope of the mercury lamp should be avoided as finger marks will gradually 
'burn' into the surface thereby reducing transmission. A thin film of polymer 
may occasionally be deposited on the outer surface of A adjacent to the lamp 
and this should be removed, otherwise light input to the reaction medium will be 
severely reduced. An ingenious apparatus has been described 30 using fluorescent 
tubes as light source, which allows the radiation to fall directly on to a moving 
thin film of the reaction solution thus avoiding this difficulty and also obviating 
the need for expensive quartz apparatus. 

Irradiation of a solid substrate often gives a single product, whereas in solu- 
tion a number of isomers may be formed (e.g. in dimerisation reactions); this is 
presumably due to the ordered arrangement of the substrate molecules in the 
solid phase. Such reactions may be carried out in a variety of ways. When irradi- 
ation by a mercury arc lamp is necessary, the material may be deposited as a thin 
film on the inside wall of a container (such as a large glass gas jar) by evaporat- 
ing its concentrated solution in a volatile solvent; the lamp unit may then be 
inserted into the jar. Alternatively the finely powdered material may be placed in 
petri dishes under an arc lamp and stirred occasionally to provide a fresh surface 
for irradiation. When sunlight is a suitable source of radiant energy, exposure of 
the powdered material contained in large petri dishes may be employed, or a 
round-bottomed flask may be coated on the inside with a thin layer of material 
by the evaporation procedure and exposed to the sun, occasionally rotating the 
flask to ensure even exposure. 

Details of a very large number of photochemical reactions have been pub- 
lished. 2931

2.17.6 ELECTROLYTIC (ANODIC) SYNTHESES (THE KOLBE REACTION) 

Electro-organic chemistry is the study of the oxidation and reduction of organic 
molecules and ions, dissolved in a suitable solvent, at an anode and cathode re- 
spectively in an electrolysis cell, and the subsequent reactions of the species so 
formed. The first experiment of this type was reported in 1849 by Kolbe, who 
described the electrolysis of an aqueous solution of a carboxylate salt and the 
isolation of a hydrocarbon. The initial step involves an anodic oxidation of the 
carboxylate anion to a radical which then dimerises to the alkane.

Following the study of the simple coupling of radicals derived from the salt 
of a single carboxylic acid, it was found that the electrolysis of a mixture of car- 
boxylate anions or of the salts of half esters of dicarboxylic acids increased the 
synthetic value of the method. This arises from the possibility of the formation of 
symmetrical and unsymmetrical coupled products of the derived radicals. These 
anodic syntheses are illustrated in the synthesis of hexacosane (Expt 5.11), 
sebacic acid (decanedioic acid), octadecanedioic acid and myristic acid (tetra- 
decanoic acid), in Expt 5.131. 

The electrolysis cell used for these conversions may be readily constructed in 
the laboratory (Fig. 2.68) and provides a simple introduction to the technique of 
electro-organic chemistry which is of increasing importance in organic synthesis. 
The cell consists of a cylindrical Pyrex glass vessel (16 cm x 7 cm) fitted with an 
internal cooling coil so that the temperature of the electrolyte may be controlled; 
a working temperature range of 30 to 35 °C is usually satisfactory, but excessive 
cooling may cause some of the product to crystallise. With a smaller electrolytic 
cell constructed from a large boiling tube the internal coil may be omitted and 
cooling effected by external means only. In either case no stirring is required 
since the evolution of carbon dioxide during electrolysis provides adequate agi- 
tation of the electrolyte. The electrodes consist of two platinum plates (4 cm x 
2.5 cm x 0.3 mm) set about 2 mm apart to each of which is attached a platinum 
wire sealed into a glass tube containing mercury by which contact with the d.c. 
electrical circuit is effected. The carboxylic acid is dissolved in methanol (con-

taining sufficient sodium methoxide to convert about 2 per cent of the added 
acids into the carboxylate salts), and the solution electrolysed with a current of 
between 1 and 2 amperes until the electrolyte becomes slightly alkaline. The 
length of time required to complete the electrolysis may be roughly estimated for 
carboxylic acids and half acid methyl esters to be between 20 and 50 per cent in 
excess of the theoretical value calculated from the number of Faradays required 
in relation to the amount of acid employed, i.e. from the equation It/96 500 = 
mol R-C0 2 e , where / is the current in amperes and t the time in seconds. It is 
often advantageous occasionally to reverse the direction of the current to dis- 
lodge insoluble deposits on one or other of the electrodes; if this is not done the 
current will be observed to drop prematurely, leading to a slowing down of the 
electrolysis. 

Some general considerations which require variations in the simple electro- 
lysis cell construction described above to meet the requirements for electrolytic 
oxidations and reductions of a wide range of organic compounds may be briefly 
summarised, but attention is drawn to the very extensive surveys which are 
available. 32 

The first general comment relates to the solvent system. In those cases where 
the electrolysis substrate does not exist in an aqueous^thanolic or methanolic 
solution in a suitable ionic form, it is necessary to provide a solvent system of 
low electrical resistance which will dissolve the substrate, and also a supporting 
electrolyte whose function is to carry the current between the electrodes. 
Examples of such solvents are dioxane, glyme, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide 
and dimethyl sulphoxide; supporting electrolytes include the alkali metal halides 
and perchlorates, and the alkylammonium salts (e.g. perchlorates, tetrafluoro- 
borates, toluene-p-sulphonates). With these electrolysis substrates, mass transfer 
to the electrode surface is effected by efficient stirring. 

Although not relevant to the Kolbe reaction, a second comment relates to the 
necessity of ensuring that products formed at the working electrode (either 
anode or cathode) do not migrate to, and react at, the counter electrode or 
indeed react with compounds formed at the counter electrode. Recent cell 
designs therefore incorporate anode and cathode compartments separated by a 
rigid porous membrane. The difficulties of so selecting a glass frit of porosity 
sufficient to ensure transport of current, but not of electrolysis substrate or prod- 
ucts, has in part been overcome by the use of a frit which supports a gel mem- 
brane. 33 This gel is formed by impregnating the frit with a hot solution of 
methylcellulose in dimethylformamide and allowing to cool. These membranes 
appear to be stable for the length of time required for an electrolysis when aceto- 
nitrile and 1,2-dimethoxyethane are used as solvent systems. 

The electrode material frequently has crucial consequences on the course of 
electrolytic oxidation and reduction processes. Although platinum is the com- 
monest electrode material, carbon, mercury and copper have all been used in 
numerous specific conversions. Selection of electrode material should therefore 
be based upon previously established characteristics when new conversions are 
to be studied. 

2.17.7 LIQUID AMMONIA TECHNIQUES 

Many important synthetic organic reactions are carried out in liquid ammonia 
(b.p. — 33 °C); this is a good solvent for many organic compounds having a 

116 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



range of polarities, and also for the metals lithium, potassium, sodium and cal- 
cium. 

Solutions of these metals in liquid ammonia effect (i) the reduction of a range 
of functional groups such as carbonyl and acetylenic and also conjugated and 
aromatic systems, and (ii) cleavage of benzyl and allyl ethers and thioethers. 
These reactions are usually carried out by the general procedure of adding the 
metal to a solution of the substrate in liquid ammonia to which dry methanol or 
ethanol or t-butanol has been added to provide a ready proton source (alcohols 
are more acidic than ammonia). 34 

A second principal use of liquid ammonia involves forming a suspension of 
an alkali metal amide (LiNH 2 , KNH 2 or NaNH 2 ) by adding the appropriate 
metal to liquid ammonia containing a trace of iron(m) ions (added as iron(m) 
nitrate) as a catalyst. 

2Na + 2NH 3 &gt; 2NaNH 2 + H 2 

The amide ions are powerful bases and may be used (i) to dehydrohalogenate 
halo-compounds to alkenes and alkynes, and (ii) to generate reactive anions 
from terminal acetylenes, and compounds having reactive a-hydrogens (e.g. car- 
bonyl compounds, nitriles, 2-alkylpyridines, etc.); these anions may then be used 
in a variety of synthetic procedures, e.g. alkylations, reactions with carbonyl 
components, etc. A further use of the metal amides in liquid ammonia is the 
formation of other important bases such as sodium triphenylmethide (from 
sodamide and triphenylmethane). 

Although these amides are frequently used as a suspension in liquid ammo- 
nia, an inert co-solvent (such as ether or tetrahydrofuran) may be added should 
the organic substrate not be readily soluble in liquid ammonia. Alternatively 
after amide formation the liquid ammonia may be allowed to evaporate com- 
pletely during simultaneous addition of the inert solvent; subsequently the 
organic substrate may be added in the same solvent to the alkali amide. 

Liquid ammonia is supplied in cylinders (Section 4.2.5, p. 417) which incor- 
porate a simple tap valve with a screw-thread wide-bore outlet. Although a 
special gas-reducing valve may be obtained from the suppliers, for most pur- 
poses it is adequate to screw on to the outlet a wide-bore metal-tube adapter 
(Fig. 2.69(a)) to which may be fitted wide-bore rubber or stout polyethylene 
tubing, secured by copper wire. When the cylinder is upright only ammonia gas 




117 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



will be released when the valve is opened. To obtain liquid ammonia, the 
cylinder needs to be supported valve downwards at an angle of about 60° from 
the vertical position, with the outlet valve above the level of the vessel into which 
the liquid ammonia is to be discharged. The cylinder should be securely sup- 
ported in a purpose-designed scaffolding, an example of which is illustrated in 
Fig. 2.69(b). Current safety regulations recommend that no cylinder should be 
located within a laboratory area. It may be found convenient to locate the 
cylinder along the outside wall adjoining the fume cupboard of a dangerous 
operations laboratory (Section 2.3.2, p. 41); the inlet tube may then be led 
through a hole in the wall directly into the fume cupboard. Although this out- 
side area for the cylinder should be suitably protected against the weather, the 
cylinder should nevertheless be returned to the main cylinder store after use. 

The valve tap on the cylinder is very tightly closed; it is best released by 
attaching the valve lever and gently tapping the lever end with a hammer in 
short sharp blows with gradually increasing force until the ammonia starts to 
escape. This method is easier and is to be preferred to continuously applied hand 
pressure. 

The rubber or plastic outlet tube should be depression-free and lead via an 
adapter into the receiver flask (see below) which must be sited in the fume cup- 
board, and it is advised that this delivery tube be additionally supported by 
means of a retort stand and clamp. This latter precaution is necessary since the 
initial force of ammonia release may cause it to flex with considerable thrust 
which may lead to apparatus damage. 

Until the cylinder valve, valve outlet and adapter, and rubber or plastic 
tubing have cooled to — 33 °C, only ammonia gas emerges. Eventually however 
liquid ammonia will flow into the flask and when this has cooled to — 33 °C it 
may be filled with the appropriate quantity; this may be gauged by pre-marking 
the vessel to the volume of liquid required. The flask selected should be of such 
size that it is only half full. This cooling effect leads to the final liquid ammonia 
sample containing traces of moisture (between 0.1 and 0.5 g/1), but this impurity 
is not harmful in the subsequent reactions. Such traces of moisture may be 
detected and removed by the addition of a little sodium metal with stirring; a 
rapid disappearance of the initial blue colour indicates some water present while 
a persistent blue colour indicates its absence. The laborious and often wasteful 
procedure of redistilling liquid ammonia using an acetone-Cardice charged con- 
denser is not usually worth while (see, however, Section 7.5, p. 1114). 

The simplest apparatus assembly is shown in Fig. 2.69(c). It consists of a 
three-necked round-bottomed flask of appropriate size equipped with a 
mechanical stirrer unit fitted with a Hershberg wire stirrer or a Teflon or a glass 
stirrer sited in the central neck. A pressure-equalising dropping funnel fitted 
with a soda-lime-filled guard-tube (not calcium chloride) is placed in one side- 
neck. The second side-neck accommodates the inlet adapter for the liquid 
ammonia supply, and this may subsequently be closed with a glass stopper; the 
addition of metals, other solid reagents, or gaseous reagents such as acetylene is 
also made through this side-neck. The flask is surrounded by a box containing 
cork chips, vermiculite or other insulating material; the outside of the flask 
rapidly acquires a coating of ice when being charged with liquid ammonia and 
this provides additional insulation. The flask contents may be viewed by the re- 
moval from time to time of a section of the external ice coating by pouring a few 
drops of acetone or ethanol on to the outside of the flask from a wash bottle.

Fig. 2.69 

Alternatively the flask may be surrounded by an acetone-Cardice bath if reac- 
tion temperatures in the region of — 78 °C are required, or where there may be 
some danger of the reaction product being of such a volatility as to be swept 
away in the stream of ammonia vapour. 

This basic apparatus assembly may be modified to meet a range of alternative 
circumstances. For example, if no pressure-equalising dropping funnel is avail- 
able, an adapter with T-connection may be inserted between the flask and a nor- 
mal dropping funnel; the outlet of the T-connection is attached to a soda-lime 
guard-tube. Alternatively a dropping funnel may be used directly, in which case 
the second side arm of the flask should be closed with a soda-lime guard-tube; if 
stirring of the reaction mixture is vigorous it may be necessary to interpose a 
short air condenser between this guard-tube and the flask. 

A further modification may be required if the reagent to be added from the 
dropping funnel is sensitive to the action of ammonia vapour. In such a case not 
only should the atmosphere around the reagent be of some inert gas (e.g. nitro- 
gen) but also the reagent should be added below the surface of the liquid ammo- 
nia. The modification shown in Fig. 2.69(d) may be employed in this case. The 
adapter illustrated is a stirrer guide with gas inlet connection; the dropping 
funnel is of the pressure-equalising type; a normal dropping funnel requires that 
the second side-neck of the flask permits the escape of gas to the atmosphere via 
a guard-tube. 

The individual sequence of operations subsequent to half-filling the flask with 
liquid ammonia depends on the nature of the reactions involved. Specific details 
are given in Expts 5.23, 5.26 and 5.43. A general comment however is worth 
noting that during the course of the reaction ammonia gas is continuously 
escaping, and in all but prolonged reaction sequences it is advisable to ensure an 
initial adequate supply of liquid ammonia in the reaction flask to avoid the 
necessity of topping up the level. In some reactions it has been noted that con- 
siderable foaming occurs during the addition of reagents. This may be con- 
trolled to some extent by the addition of a little ether, or by raising the stirrer 
blade so that it agitates the surface of the liquid and hence assists in the rapid 
breakdown of foam. If these measures are unsuccessful, reagent addition should 
be stopped until foaming abates, and continued addition should then take place 
more slowly. 

The simplest work-up procedure for non-volatile reaction products and 
products which are obtained in the form of alkali metal salts is to allow the 
ammonia to evaporate overnight through the guard-tube into a vented fume 



119 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



cupboard. Usually in these cases an inert solvent such as ether or tetrahydro- 
furan is added to the flask before evaporation commences. If time is important 
the flask may be placed on a warm water bath (c. 45-50 °C) and the flask con- 
tents stirred; this should also be carried out in a fume cupboard. In either case a 
stream of nitrogen may be introduced into the flask if the product is sensitive to 
atmospheric oxidation. The subsequent treatment of the residue will depend 
upon the particular reaction and individual experiments should be consulted for 
typical isolation procedures. 

With volatile products which may arise in reactions which do not lead to the 
initial formation of metal salts (i.e. dehydrohalogenations, alkylations leading to 
terminal acetylenes) the following procedure is recommended. 35 

The three-necked reaction flask is fitted with a stopcock in one side-neck, a 
stopper in the second side-neck and a wide-bore glass tube (4-5 mm internal dia- 
meter) fitted by means of a rubber bung or screw-capped adapter to the central 
neck. This glass tube, which reaches to within a few millimetres from the flask 
bottom, is fitted with a plastic tube which terminates below the surface of an 
ample quantity of crushed ice contained in a large conical flask. Some extraction 
solvent which is to be used in the work -up is added to the crushed ice. When the 
stopcock is turned off the pressure build-up forces the liquid ammonia solution 
into the ice-solvent mixture, the flow being controlled by periodically opening 
the stopcock. Additional ice is added to the conical flask as required until the 
transfer of liquid ammonia solution is complete. The reaction flask is rinsed with 
extraction solvent and this is added to the main bulk. If the reaction mixture 
contains large amonts of salts (e.g. sodium halides) it is necessary to swirl the 
flask in order to keep the salts in suspension and so prevent the tube becoming 
blocked - if this should happen the stopcock must be opened immediately. An 
alternative procedure is to allow the salts to settle to the bottom of the reaction 
flask and gradually lower the glass tube through the liquid as transfer is effected; 
when all the supernatant liquid has been transferred crushed ice and extraction 
solvent is added to the residue which is then combined with the main bulk. 

2.17.8 REACTIONS INVOLVING AIR-SENSITIVE COMPOUNDS 

It is often necessary to carry out reactions in an inert atmosphere or to handle 
starting materials, intermediates or products which are air-sensitive. Such reac- 
tions can be carried out successfully without specialised apparatus, such as 
Schlenk tubes and purpose-designed vacuum lines, 36 provided attention is given 
to the detail of the procedure. The procedures described in this section should be 
routinely within the capacity of advanced students and of the practising organic 
chemist. Suppliers of air-sensitive materials provide guidance on handling tech- 
niques which should always be followed carefully. Particularly useful is the 
pamphlet published by Aldrich Chemical Company. 37 Reactions involving 
organolithium reagents (e.g. Expts 5.10; 6.158; 7.3), organoboranes 38 (e.g. Expt 
5.44) and Wittig reagents (Section 5.17) are among those which require these 
standard procedures. The yield from Grignard reactions (e.g. Expts 5.39-5.42) 
may well be improved if the reactions are carried out in this manner. 

Even if reactions of this sort are carried out only relatively infrequently, it is 
advisable to set up a simple nitrogen (or argon) line which will facilitate many of 
the operations described in this section. The line leading from the gas cylinder is 
shown diagrammatically in Fig. 2.70.

It consists of a pressure reducing valve, a T-piece to allow flushing of syringes 
and cannulae, T-pieces to allow flow of inert gas to the apparatus and to allow 
evacuation of the apparatus, and a bubbler to indicate the flow of the inert gas 
and to allow a slight positive pressure of the inert gas to be maintained in the 
apparatus. Nitrogen can be led to the apparatus directly by rubber or preferably 
polythene tubing. It is important that this tubing is dry and flushed with nitro- 
gen before attaching it to the apparatus. It is advisable to keep a selection of 
tubing specifically for this purpose and not to mix it with tubing used for water 
condensers and other purposes. An alternative and convenient method of lead- 
ing nitrogen to the apparatus is to attach a syringe needle to the nitrogen line by 
means of a wired -in Luer lock fitting. Nitrogen can thus be fed easily into a reac- 
tion set-up via a rubber septum. 

To carry out reactions successfully in an inert atmosphere it is necessary to 
ensure each of the following: 

1. That the 'inert atmosphere' is in fact inert and does not react with any of the 
reagents or intermediates. 

2. That before the reaction is started the apparatus is thoroughly dry and filled 
with the inert gas. 

3. That all reagents and solvents are dry and oxygen free. 

4. That solvents and reagents are transferred to the reaction vessel in such a way 
that they do not come into contact with air or moisture. 

5. That the air-sensitive materials are handled in an inert atmosphere through- 
out. 

How to achieve each of these requirements is described in the following sections. 

INERT GAS 

Nitrogen is commonly used as the inert gas and the commercially available 
material is satisfactory for most purposes without pretreatment. If there is any 
doubt about the purity of the nitrogen gas it may be purified as described in 
Section 4.2.52. An alternative inert gas to nitrogen may be required in cases 
where one or more of the reagents (e.g. lithium metal) reacts with nitrogen. In 
such cases argon may be used although it is considerably more expensive than 
nitrogen. 

DRYING THE APPARATUS AND FILLING WITH INERT GAS 

One of the following procedures should be used to ensure that the apparatus to 
be used is dry and filled with inert gas. 

Method I. Dry the apparatus in the oven (120 °C) for several hours, and 

121 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



preferably overnight. Allow the apparatus to cool in a desiccator and then 
assemble with a stream of nitrogen flowing through it. 

Method!. After over-drying, assemble the apparatus hot and allow it to 
cool while nitrogen flows through it. 

Method 3. Assemble the apparatus cold and flame it thoroughly with a 
Bunsen flame to drive out moisture while purging with nitrogen and allow to 
cool with continuing nitrogen flow. 

Method 4. Evacuate the apparatus using a vacuum pump and refill it with 
inert gas. Repeat the evacuation and refilling process twice more. This procedure 
is described in more detail below. 

DRYING SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 

Procedures for drying reagents and solvents are described in Chapter 4. Dry sol- 
vents which have not been redistilled under nitrogen should be de-oxygenated 
by bubbling a stream of nitrogen through them using the gas delivery tube 
shown in Fig. 2.59. This procedure can be carried out conveniently in a two- 
necked flask equipped with the gas inlet tube and a rubber septum into which a 
syringe needle is inserted to allow nitrogen to escape after bubbling through the 
solvent. Solvent may be removed using a syringe or cannula inserted into the 
septum as described below. An alternative method of ensuring that relatively 
small volumes of solvent are oxygen free is to use the repeated freeze/thaw cycle. 
In this procedure the liquid is placed in the reaction set-up and frozen with 
liquid nitrogen. The apparatus is then evacuated, isolated from the vacuum line 
and allowed to warm up. Gas absorbed in the liquid is released. The liquid is 
again frozen and the apparatus is evacuated to pump off the released gases. This 
process is repeated once more and finally the reaction apparatus is filled with 
nitrogen. Many dried and redistilled solvents absorb air and moisture very read- 
ily and it is therefore advisable to transfer them by the procedure described 
below using a syringe or cannula so that they are not exposed to the atmosphere. 

TRANSFER OF SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 

Liquids. Routine transfer of air-sensitive liquids is carried out with a syringe or 
with a long flexible wide-bore, double-tipped needle (cannula), which is inserted 
into reaction vessels and storage containers via a rubber septum. A septum is 
simply a flexible rubber stopper with a sleeve which folds down over the neck of 
the container. The septum can be pierced by a syringe needle and reseals itself 
when the needle is removed. It is thus an essential piece of equipment for reac- 
tions in an inert atmosphere. They are available in a range of sizes to fit standard 
ground glass joints, stopcock arms and containers. Septa gradually deteriorate 
when exposed to organic solvents for a long period. Exposure to solvents should 
therefore be limited as far as possible, for example by separating them from 
refluxing solvent by attaching them to a flask via an interposed stopcock rather 
than directly into the neck of the flask. After repeated insertion of needles into 
the septum it will eventually cease to be gas-tight and will need to be discarded. 
Glass syringes are available in a wide range of sizes and with a variety of fit- 
tings. Syringes for the transfer of small volumes of liquids are individually 
ground and calibrated and do not have interchangeable barrels and plungers. It 
is important that the barrels and plungers are used only as a matched pair, 
otherwise accuracy will be lost and there will be a danger of the plunger sticking 
in the barrel. Larger volume syringes have interchangeable plungers, although 

122 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 



in this case the accuracy with which the volume of liquid can be measured is 
reduced. Plastic syringes are also available and although they are suitable for 
transferring many aqueous solutions they are not recommended for general use 
in the organic laboratory. 

A degree of care is necessary when handling syringes if expensive damage is to 
be avoided and accurate delivery of volumes of liquid ensured. Care is also 
needed to ensure that the needle is firmly fitted to the syringe. If it should 
become detached with the syringe full of air-sensitive or pyrophoric compound 
the consequences could be disastrous. Two further commonly encountered 
problems are the attachment of the needle to the barrel of the syringe, and 
plungers sticking in the barrel of the syringe. With the simple syringe design a 
tight seal between the syringe and the needle is best obtained by attaching the 
needle to the barrel when both are hot after drying in the oven, and allowing 
them to cool together. The greater contraction of the metal needle ensures a 
good fit. In order to remove the needle subsequently it may be necessary to 
warm its neck gently in the Bunsen flame. This should not be done until all 
organic material has been removed by flushing with a suitable low-boiling sol- 
vent and 'pumping' to evaporate the remaining traces of liquid. Syringes with 
Luer lock fittings should not present any difficulty in attaching the needle to the 
syringe. In order to ensure that the plunger moves freely in the barrel and to 
minimise the dangers of sticking, the plunger on interchangeable syringes can be 
lubricated with a small amount of silicone grease. Normally syringe needles 
have bevelled tips in order to penetrate the rubber septum easily. In some cases 
it is desirable to have a needle with a flat tip, for example in the flask-to-flask 
transfer of liquids described below when it is desired to remove the last drops of 
liquid from a container. These are available commercially, but it is necessary to 
puncture the septum initially with a normal bevel-tipped needle before attempt- 
ing to pass the flat-tipped needle through. 

A typical procedure for transferring a liquid (5-100 ml) from one septum- 
capped vessel to another with a syringe is as follows. Select a syringe with a 
capacity of the same order as the volume of liquid to be transferred. The needle 
should be long enough to reach below the surface of the liquid to be transferred 
and also sufficiently long and flexible to allow the syringe to be inverted while 
still inserted in the septum. Ensure that the syringe and needle are clean. Dry 
them in an oven at 120 °C for 3-4 hours and allow them to cool in a desiccator. 
The needle can be attached to the barrel of the syringe while it is hot so that as it 
cools a tight fit is assured. Flush the syringe with nitrogen as follows. Push the 
plunger to the bottom of the barrel of the syringe and insert the needle through 
the septum on the nitrogen line (see Fig. 2.70). Slowly withdraw the plunger to 
the maximum graduation on the barrel to fill it with nitrogen and then withdraw 
the needle from the septum. Expel the nitrogen from the syringe and repeat the 
process of filling with nitrogen and emptying twice more. The syringe is now 
ready for use in transferring air-sensitive liquids. Ensure that the vessel from 
which the liquid is to be removed is connected to the nitrogen line and that there 
is a slight positive pressure of nitrogen. This can be achieved most easily by 
inserting a syringe needle attached to the nitrogen line through the rubber sep- 
tum. Now hold the needle of the prepared syringe close to its tip and insert it 
through the septum into the vessel containing the liquid to be transferred. It 
should be inserted sufficiently far for the tip of the needle to be below the surface 
of the liquid in the vessel. Slowly withdraw the plunger until slightly more than 

123 



2.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the required volume has been taken up into the syringe. It is quite likely that in 
this process bubbles of gas will be generated in the liquid and accumulate at the 
surface of the liquid in the syringe. This gas can be expelled, assuming a suffi- 
ciently long and flexible needle has been attached to the syringe initially, by rais- 
ing the tip of the needle above the surface of the liquid in the flask, carefully 
inverting the syringe and then expelling the gas into the vessel (Fig. 2.71). The 
syringe should now contain only liquid and can be returned to the vertical posi- 
tion. The required volume of liquid can be obtained by depressing the plunger 
appropriately. The needle can now be withdrawn from the septum and the liquid 
transferred via a septum to the reaction vessel or dropping funnel. The plunger 
should be depressed gradually to the bottom of the barrel. 

If the transfer of an accurately measured volume is required the liquid 
remaining in the needle should not be expelled by pumping the plunger of the 
syringe. Syringes are calibrated to deliver a given volume when the plunger is 
fully depressed. In any event, the volume of liquid in the needle will obviously 
vary significantly depending on the length and diameter of the needle. Care 
should be taken in disposing of any reactive material remaining in the syringe 
needle by carefully drawing into the syringe suitable clean, dry solvent and then 
expelling the syringe contents into a container for treatment or disposal. The 
accuracy with which a volume of liquid can be measured with a syringe is 
limited. With a syringe up to 1 ml an accuracy of 1-2% may be achievable with 
practice and this should be satisfactory, for example, for the removal of aliquot 
portions in the estimation of solutions of alkyllithiums (Section 4.2.47, p. 442). 
With larger volumes the accuracy of measurement decreases. If a precisely 
measured volume of liquid is required for addition to a reaction it is advisable to 
pre-calibrate a dropping funnel specifically for this purpose or to transfer an 
accurately measured volume or weighed amount, rather than rely on the accur- 
acy of a syringe or a graduated dropping funnel. 

An alternative to the syringe technique for the transfer of liquids uses the 
double-ended needle and is suitable when it is not necessary to know precisely 
the volume of liquid being transferred, or when the volume is being measured in 
some other way, e.g. by transfer from a septum-capped measuring cylinder. This

method is particularly useful for the transfer of an air-sensitive intermediate 
from the flask in which it has been prepared into a second reaction set-up, or for 
the transfer of commercially available air-sensitive material supplied in an air- 
tight container. The procedure is illustrated in Fig. 2.72. The cannula (double- 
ended needle) is inserted just through the septum of flask A which contains the 
liquid to be transferred, through which nitrogen is flowing, and purged by allow- 
ing nitrogen to flow through it for a minute or two. The other end of the needle is 
then inserted through the septum of flask B, previously flushed with nitrogen. 
The tip of the needle in the delivery flask A is then lowered below the level of the 
liquid. The rate of transfer of liquid can then be controlled by adjusting the flow 
of nitrogen into the delivery flask with the three-way stopcock. If it is desired to 
transfer the total contents of the delivery flask a cannula with a flat end rather 
than the normal bevelled end should be used. The liquid could be transferred if 
required via a septum to the dropping funnel of the second reaction set-up 
rather than directly into the flask. On occasions it is necessary to transfer inter- 
mediates which have been prepared at low temperature and which would deteri- 
orate if allowed to warm up. This problem may be solved in one of two ways 
depending on the temperature sensitivity of the intermediate. The first method is 
to transfer the solution in small batches to the dropping funnel (which could if 
necessary be jacketed) with the majority of the solution remaining in the cooled 
delivery flask. Alternatively the cannula itself can be looped and passed through 
a cooling bath held at the required temperature. 

Solids. Some solids can be added to the reaction flask at the start of the reaction 
before the apparatus is filled with inert gas and therefore present little problem. 
Examples include magnesium for Grignard reactions and metal hydrides. In the 
latter case it may be necessary to remove oil in which the hydride is suspended 
(Section 4.2.49, p. 445) and this can be achieved using the procedures described 
below for separating solids and liquids in an inert atmosphere. If it is necessary 
to add a solid to the reaction mixture during the course of a reaction, a modifica- 
tion of the apparatus shown in Fig. 2.57 can be used in which a flask with a 
ground glass neck is linked to the reaction flask by an adapter with two male 
ground glass joints. Addition of the solid is achieved by rotation of the adapter 
in the neck of the flask. If the solid is to be added under reflux, the apparatus 
shown in Fig. 2.58 can be used. 

Gases. Gases can be added to reactions in an inert atmosphere by an extension 
of the standard procedures noted in Section 2.15. If the quantity of gas does not

have to be measured (i.e. it is simply required to produce a saturated solution), 
the gas can be bubbled into the liquid in the normal way as shown in Fig. 2.59, 
with the appropriate precautions being taken to ensure that the inert atmo- 
sphere is maintained. Alternatively a balloon inflated with the required gas and 
attached to the reaction flask can be used. If it is necessary to add a known 
quantity of gas the method to be used will depend on the boiling point of the gas. 
For gases which can be condensed relatively easily, e.g. with a dry-ice condenser, 
a given volume of gas can be condensed into a measuring cylinder and then 
allowed to boil off gradually via a cannula into the reaction flask, Fig. 2.73. 

For precise determination of the amount of the condensed gas, the container 
should be weighed before and after the gas is condensed. For gases which are not 
easily condensed, the volume can be measured using a calibrated gas burette of 
the type shown in Fig. 2.63(a) and the gas then allowed to pass gradually into 
the flask after suitable drying or other purification. 

MAINTAINING AN INERT ATMOSPHERE IN THE APPARATUS 

Normally it is not necessary to have a continuous flow of the inert gas through 
the apparatus. If the reaction lasts for several hours this can be very expensive in 
the amount of gas used. It is sufficient to ensure that no air is allowed to enter 
the apparatus. This is usually achieved by maintaining a slight positive pressure 
of inert gas in the apparatus by means of a bubbler. It is important that all the 
ground glass joints are properly secured with spring clips, elastic bands or by 
being wired on, in order to ensure that they do not leak under the small positive 
pressure of the inert gas or, more importantly, come apart during the course of 

126 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.17 




s ^ 



(h) 



the reaction. An alternative and simpler way of maintaining the inert atmo- 
sphere is to use the balloon technique in which a rubber balloon is inflated with 
the inert gas and wired to the reaction flask.* A number of different types of 
bubblers is available. The simplest type is shown in Fig. 2.74(a) and has been 
noted in Fig. 2.60. 

The positive pressure of inert gas is determined by the height of the liquid 
(mineral oil or mercury) in the tube. There is a danger in this type of bubbler 
that a sudden reduction in the pressure in the reaction flask will cause a suck- 
back of the liquid from the bubbler into the reaction flask. This can be avoided 
by using a bubbler with an internal reservoir (Fig. 2.74(b)). Although this type of 
bubbler will prevent suck-back of the liquid in the bubbler into the reaction 
vessel, it will not prevent the ingress of air. This can be prevented by using a 
bubbler with a valve which closes when the pressure differential is reversed. 

Apparatus for reactions in an inert atmosphere. The experimental set-up will be 
determined by the nature of the reaction, but in all cases it will be necessary to 
meet the requirements set out above for the conduct of any reaction in an inert 
atmosphere. For the majority of purposes commercially available glassware 
with ground glass joints is adequate. A number of adapters are particularly use- 
ful for the addition of reagents via a septum. Several of these are illustrated in 
Fig. 2.75(a)-(e).The use of some of these adaptors is illustrated in the experi- 
mental set-ups which are described below. Either (a) or (b) can be fitted directly 
to the reaction flask to allow direct addition of reagents to the reaction vessel 
thus avoiding any undesired contamination which might arise from the use of a 
dropping funnel. Adapters (a) and (b) also allow removal and transfer of air- 
sensitive liquids. Adapter (c) can be used to accommodate a thermometer and to 
allow direct addition to the reaction flask via the septum side-arm. The range of 
adapters available allows considerable flexibility in arranging experimental set- 

* The balloon technique is often recommended in suitable reactions to maintain an inert and dry 
atmosphere within the reaction flask. It should be noted however that air and moisture infuse rather 
rapidly and that this atmosphere may only be maintained for half-an-hour or so.

ups for reactions in an inert atmosphere. The three-way stopcock which can be 
equipped with a rubber septum on one of its arms is particularly useful. 

Stirring. The most convenient method of stirring, particularly in small-scale 
reactions, is to use a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar (Section 2.14). How- 
ever, care must be taken to avoid over-rapid stirring which may cause the stirrer 
bar to fly free from the guiding magnet and penetrate the wall of the flask, with 
potentially disastrous results. A mechanical stirrer (such as that shown in Fig. 
2.51(a) is to be preferred in any of the following circumstances: (i) large volumes 
of liquids are used; (ii) the reaction mixture is likely to become viscous; (iii) there 
are large amounts of suspended solids; (iv) very rapid stirring is required. 

A very simple apparatus for reaction in an inert atmosphere is a one-necked 
flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and three-way stopcock (Fig. 2.76). The 
vertical arm of the stopcock is fitted with a rubber septum and the horizontal 
arm leads to a second three-way stopcock giving access to the nitrogen supply 
and to the vacuum line. This apparatus is suitable for reactions which take place 
at or below room temperature, do not require addition of solid reagent once the

reaction is under way and usually where no excessive gaseous by-products are 
formed, and where stirring can be accomplished satisfactorily with a magnetic 
stirrer. The use of this set-up is relatively limited, but the procedures described 
for filling the apparatus with inert gas and for adding liquids via the septum are 
of general applicability. 

A typical procedure for the use of the apparatus is as follows. Dry the flask in 
an oven at 120 °C for four hours or overnight and allow it to cool in a desiccator. 
The stopcocks should be dry and the barrels lightly greased. Charge the flask 
with any dry solid reagent required at the start of the reaction and with a Teflon- 
coated magnetic stirring bar. Insert into the neck of the flask the three-way stop- 
cock A fitted with a rubber septum on the vertical arm. Attach the horizontal 
arm of the stopcock to a second three-way stopcock B, one arm of which is 
attached to the nitrogen line and one to the vacuum line. Care must be taken in 
adjusting the stopcocks to ensure that the vacuum is never applied directly to 
the nitrogen line. Turn stopcock B so that the apparatus is connected to the 
vacuum line and gradually open stopcock A so that the flask is evacuated. The 
small volume of air between the barrel of stopcock A and the rubber septum 
should also be evacuated and replaced by nitrogen by appropriate manipulation 
of the stopcock. Carefully adjust stopcock B so that the apparatus is connected 
to the nitrogen line and gradually fill the flask with nitrogen. CAUTION: The 
nitrogen flow through the bubbler should be increased and the stopcock turned very 
slowly in order to avoid any suck-back through the bubbler. 

Once the flask has been filled with nitrogen turn the stopcock B so that the 
apparatus is connected to the vacuum line and evacuated once more. The pro- 
cess of evacuation and filling with nitrogen should be carried out three times. 
Adjust stopcock B so that the apparatus is connected to the nitrogen line and 
reduce the flow of nitrogen to a level sufficient to maintain a slight positive pres- 
sure in the system with the occasional bubble of nitrogen passing through the 
bubbler. Turn stopcock A so that the flask is open to the septum arm and to the 
nitrogen line, and introduce solvents or liquid reagents into the flask via the sep- 
tum with a syringe or cannula which passes through the orifice of the stopcock 
and into the flask. It is advisable to isolate the septum arm from the reaction 
flask by appropriate adjustment of stopcock A, except when additions are being 
made, in order to avoid any possibility of leakage through the septum. The reac- 
tion flask should however always be connected to the nitrogen line. If the reac- 
tion flask should require cooling during the course of the reaction care should be 
taken to increase the flow of nitrogen through the bubbler to avoid the possibil- 
ity of suck-back. If any gases are evolved during the course of the reaction they 
will escape from the exit tube of the bubbler. If these gases present any hazard 
the exit tube should be passed to a gas absorption trap (Section 2.15) or passed 
into a fume cupboard extraction vent. 

An alternative to the use of the one-necked flask described above is to use the 
apparatus shown in Fig. 2.77. In this case a two-necked flask is used, with the 
septum which is used for the addition or removal of liquids fitted to one arm of 
the flask and a three-way stopcock to the other. With this arrangement it is not 
possible to isolate the septum from the reaction flask. Should this be required 
the septum is fitted to a stopcock in the second arm of the flask. Flasks with an 
integral stopcock are available commercially. 

An experiment set-up which is more generally useful is shown in Fig. 2.78. It 
incorporates a reflux condenser, a pressure-equalising dropping funnel, a ther-

mometer and a magnetic stirrer. If a mechanical stirrer is required the ther- 
mometer and reflux condenser can be accommodated in one side-arm using an 
adapter (Fig. 2.15). This set-up can be flushed with nitrogen at the start of the 
reaction procedure by opening the stopcock on the dropping funnel and insert- 
ing a syringe needle in the septum to allow outflow of nitrogen. On occasions it 
may be found convenient to use a flask with four necks. Variations in these set- 
ups can be achieved using the adapters and the reflux condensers described in 
Section 2.7. Thus, for example, a Dewar condenser (Fig. 2.23) is used for reac- 
tions involving liquids with low boiling points.

SEPARATION OF LIQUIDS AND SOLIDS 

On occasions it is necessary to separate a liquid and a solid in an inert atmo- 
sphere. If the liquid and solid separate easily and distinctly with the solid settling 
to the bottom of the flask, the process of separation can be accomplished by 
careful use of a syringe or cannula to remove the supernatant liquid. The liquid 
may be discarded, stored or transferred to another reaction set-up for further 
reaction as appropriate. The solid remaining in the flask can be washed if neces- 
sary by the addition and subsequent removal of further quantities of dry, 
oxygen-free solvent through the septum. If the solid is desired solvent-free, 
residual solvent can be removed by connecting the flask to the vacuum line and 
condensing the solvent in a suitable trap. If the solid and liquid do not separate 
easily and the solid remains in suspension, filtration will be necessary. The sim- 
plest way of achieving this is with the gas dispersion or filter tube with a sintered 
glass end (Fig. 2.59). The technique is simlar to that described in Section 2.20 
(Fig. 2.81) for recrystallisation at low temperature. The filter tube can be fitted to 
the flask at the start of the reaction or subsequently inserted (after thorough dry- 
ing) with a rapid stream of nitrogen flowing through the neck of the flask into 
which the tube is to be inserted. If the solid is required it remains in the flask 
after further washing. If the liquid is required for further reaction it can be led 
directly to a second reaction flask. 

ISOLATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNIQUES 
2.18 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 

At the conclusion of a reaction the pure product must be isolated from the reac- 
tion mixture by a sequence of operations collectively termed the 'work-up'. As 
well as the required product the reaction mixture may contain, for example, sol- 
vent which has been used as the reaction medium, excess reactants or reagents, 
unwanted reaction products (by-products) arising from alternative reaction 
pathways and so on. The planning of the isolation operations and application to 
such complex mixtures is therefore an exacting test of the expertise of the 
chemist. Frequently a student fails to bring a successful reaction to a fruitful con- 
clusion by using an ill-considered work-up procedure, which results in loss of the 
required product either by decomposition during attempted isolation, or from a 
premature discard of product because of lack of appreciation of its physical or 
chemical properties. It should be emphasised that even when a detailed pub- 
lished procedure is being followed it is unwise to discard any liquid or solid frac- 
tions separated during work-up until the final product has been isolated and 
adequately characterised. 

Because of the length of time that a complete isolation process often takes, it 
is wise practice, particularly with new syntheses carried out for the first time, to 
monitor the progress of the reaction. Thus the disappearance from a reaction 
mixture of one of the reactants or the build-up of the reaction product, measured 
on small aliquot portions removed at convenient time intervals from the bulk 
reaction mixture, can yield valuable information on the progress of a reaction. 
Usually the former is to be preferred since the physical properties (e.g. spectro- 
scopic information, Chapter 3), chemical reactivity (e.g. characteristic tests of 
functional groups, Section 9.5) and chromatographic behaviour (Section 2.31) of 

131 



2.18 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the reactant, and the influence of solvents or other reactants on the reliability of 
the chosen monitoring processes may be readily checked before the reaction is 
commenced. 

The adoption of a particular isolation procedure will depend to a large extent 
upon the physical and chemical properties of the product. Some guidelines for 
useful general approaches may however be given with regard to the physical 
state at ambient temperature of the crude mixture resulting from the reaction, 
i.e. whether it is a one-phase (either solid or liquid) or a two-phase (solid/liquid or 
liquid /liquid) system. 

In the case of the one-phase solid system if the organic product is neutral and 
insoluble in water, washing with water may be used to remove soluble impurities 
such as inorganic salts. Alternatively the crude solid may be extracted with a 
suitable organic solvent (Section 2.22), filtered, and the extract washed with 
water. Further washing successively with dilute aqueous acid and dilute 
aqueous alkali removes basic and acidic impurities. Removal of solvent after 
drying (Sections 2.23 and 2.24) leads to the recovery of the purified solid for 
recrystallisation from a suitable solvent (Section 2.20). Continuous extraction of 
the solid (e.g. in a Soxhlet apparatus) may be necessary if the required product is 
only sparingly soluble in convenient organic solvents. 

If the crude solid product contains the required product in the form of a salt 
(e.g. the alkali metal salt of a phenol) and is therefore water soluble, acidification 
of the aqueous solution (or basification in the case, for example, of amine salts) 
liberates the free acidic compound (or base) which may be recovered by filtra- 
tion or solvent extraction as appropriate. 

The one-phase liquid system is more frequently encountered since many 
organic reactions are carried out in solution. Direct fractional distillation may 
separate the product, if it is a liquid, from the solvent and other liquid reagents, 
or concentration or cooling may lead to direct crystallisation of the product if 
this is a solid. However, it is often more appropriate, whether the required 
product is a liquid or solid, to subject the solution to the acid/base extraction 
procedure outlined above and considered in detail on p. 162. This acid/base 
extraction procedure can be done directly if the product is in solution in a water- 
immiscible solvent. A knowledge of the acid-base nature of the product and of its 
water solubility is necessary to ensure that the appropriate fraction is retained 
for product recovery. In those cases where the reaction solvent is water miscible 
(e.g. methanol, ethanol, dimethylsulphoxide, etc.) it is necessary to remove all or 
most of the solvent by distillation and to dissolve the residue in an excess of a 
water-immiscible solvent before commencing the extraction procedure. The re- 
moval of solvent from fractions obtained by these extraction procedures is these 
days readily effected by the use of a rotary evaporator (p. 185) and this obviates 
the tedium of removal of large volumes of solvent by conventional distillation. 

A crude reaction mixture consisting of two phases is very common. In the case 
of a solid/liquid system, it will of course be necessary to make certain in which 
phase the required product resides. A simple example is where the product may 
have crystallised out from the reaction solvent; the mixture therefore only re- 
quires to be cooled and filtered for the bulk of the product to be isolated. The 
filtrate should then routinely be subjected to suitable concentration or extrac- 
tion procedures to obtain the maximum yield of product. 

Direct filtration would also be employed when the solid consists of unwanted 
reaction products, in which case the filtrate would be treated as the single-phase 



132 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.19 



liquid system above. Where it is evident that the product has crystallised out 
admixed with contaminating solid material a separation might be effected if the 
mixture is reheated and filtered hot (p. 139). 

Liquid/liquid two-phase systems are often encountered; for example, they re- 
sult from the frequent practice of quenching a reaction carried out in an organic 
solvent by pouring it on to ice or into dilute acid. A further instance of a liquid/ 
liquid system arises from the use of steam distillation (Section 2.25) as a pre- 
liminary isolation procedure. This is particulalry suitable for the separation of 
relatively high-boiling liquids and steam volatile solids from inorganic con- 
taminants, involatile tars, etc. The subsequent work-up procedure normally 
presents no additional problems since the phases are usually readily separable 
and can be treated in a manner appropriate to the chemical or physical proper- 
ties of the required product by procedures already outlined. 

All these preliminary procedures give solid or liquid products which are 
rarely of high purity; the degree of purity may be checked by chromatographic 
and spectroscopic methods. Purification may often be successfully accomplished 
by recrystallisation or sublimation for solids (Sections 2.20 and 2.21); fractional 
distillation under atmospheric or reduced pressure for liquids or low melting 
solids (Sections 2.26 and 2.27); molecular distillation for high-boiling liquids 
(Section 2.28). In those cases where the use of these traditional methods does not 
yield product of adequate purity, resort must be made to preparative chromato- 
graphic procedures (p. 199). Here a knowledge of the chromatographic be- 
haviour obtained from small-scale trial experiments will be particularly 
valuable. 

The final assessment of the purity of a known product is made on the basis of 
its physical constants (Sections 2.33 to 2.37 and Chapter 3) in comparison with 
those cited in the literature. In the case of a new compound the purity should be 
assessed and the structural identity established by appropriate chromatographic 
and spectroscopic methods. 

2.19 FILTRATION TECHNIQUES 

Filtration of a mixture after completion of a reaction will often be necessary 
either to isolate a solid product which has separated out or to remove insoluble 
impurities or reactants, in which case the desired product remains in solution. In 
this section the nitration of cold solutions is described; the nitration of hot solu- 
tions is considered in Section 2.20. 

When substantial quantities of a solid are to be filtered from suspension in a 
liquid, a Buchner funnel of convenient size is employed. The ordinary Buchner 
funnel (Fig. 2.43(a)) consists of a cylindrical porcelain funnel carrying a fixed, 
flat, perforated porcelain plate. It is fitted by means of a rubber stopper, rubber 
cone or flat rubber ring into the neck of a thick-walled filtering flask (also 
termed a filter flask, Buchner flask or suction flask) (Fig. 2.43(c)), which is con- 
nected by means of thick-walled rubber tubing (rubber 'pressure' tubing) to a 
similar flask or safety bottle, and the latter is attached by rubber 'pressure' 
tubing to a filter pump; the safety bottle or trap is essential since a sudden fall in 
water pressure may result in the water being sucked back and contaminating the 
filtrate. The use of suction renders rapid filtration possible and also results in a 
more complete removal of the mother-liquor than filtration under atmospheric 

133 



2.19 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



pressure. A filter paper is selected (and trimmed, if necessary) of such size that it 
covers the entire perforated plate, but its diameter should be slightly less than 
the inside diameter of the funnel; the filter paper should never be folded up 
against the sides of the funnel. The filter paper is moistened with a few drops of 
clear supernatant liquor and the suction of the pump applied, when the filter 
paper should adhere firmly to, and completely cover, the perforated plate of the 
funnel and thus prevent any solid matter from passing under the edge of the 
paper into the flask below. As much of the supernatant liquor as possible is now 
poured into the funnel and filtered before the bulk of the residual slurry is trans- 
ferred to the filter funnel; this procedure is often quicker than initially bringing 
all the solid into suspension and pouring it directly on to the filter. Furthermore 
initial gentle suction often leads to more effective filtration than powerful suc- 
tion since in the latter case the finer particles of solid may reduce the rate of fil- 
tration by being drawn into the pores of the filter paper. Any solid remaining in 
the reaction flask is easily transferred by rinsing with a little of the filtrate* and 
well stirring to remove solids which may be adhering to the sides of the reaction 
flask. This operation may be repeated until all solid material has been trans- 
ferred to the filter. The suction is continued until most of the liquid has passed 
through and this is facilitated by pressing the solid down with a wide glass 
stopper to leave a uniformly flat, pressed surface. The filter cake is then washed 
with an appropriate solvent and again sucked dry. If the filter cake is the 
required product, then this must be subjected to purification using suitable 
recrystallisation procedures (Section 2.20). If the filtrate contains the reaction 
product, further suitable isolation procedures would then of course be adopted 
(e.g. Sections 2.22, 2.25 and 2.31). 

Some modification to the above general technique of isolation by filtration 
may be necessary in the light of the chemical nature of the reaction mixture, of 
the particle size of the solid, or of the ratio of the amount of solid to liquid mater- 
ial to be filtered. 

For example, strongly alkaline or strongly acidic reaction mixtures weaken 
cellulose filter papers. Acid-hardened grades which are more chemically resist- 
ant are commercially available (e.g. Whatman filter papers) but for maximum 
resistance to chemical attack, glass-fibre paper (e.g. Whatman) or a glass funnel 
fitted with a fixed sintered glass plate (Section 2.11) may be used. 

The filtration of very finely divided suspended material is often very tedious 
as a result of the filter paper pores becoming clogged. In such a case the addition 
of a suitable filter aid (e.g. a high grade diatomaceous earth such as Celite 545, or 
Whatman filter aids) to the suspension overcomes the problem; alternatively the 
suspension may be filtered through a bed of filter aid prepared by pouring a 
slurry of it in a suitable solvent into the filter funnel fitted with the required size 
of filter paper. The initial application of gentle suction in the filtration is in this 
case vital. A glass-fibre filter paper, supported on a conventional filter paper in a 
Buchner or Hirsch funnel, is useful for the rapid removal of finely divided solid 
impurities from a solution. 

The selection of a funnel appropriate to the amount of solid rather than the 
total volume of liquor to be filtered is important. When the volume of liquid is 
large relative to the amount of solid, the apparatus shown in Fig. 2.79 may be 

* The filter flask must be disconnected from the pump before the latter is turned off otherwise suck- 
back will occur which may ruin the reaction products should these be present in the filtrate.

used; here the funnel should be of a size appropriate to the amount of solid to be 
finally collected. When the receiver is about two-thirds full, atmospheric pres- 
sure is restored by suitably rotating the 'three-way' stopcock; the nitrate may 
then be removed by opening the tap at the lower end. The apparatus is again 
exhausted and the nitration continued. 

For the suction nitration of small quantities of solid (less than 5g) contained 
in a small volume of liquid, a small conical Buchner funnel, known as a Hirsch 
funnel, is employed (see Fig. 2.43(b)); the nitrate is collected either in a small 
filter flask or in a test tube with side-arm, the arrangement being illustrated in 
Fig. 2.43(f). A small sintered funnel, or a slit-sieve funnel may also be employed. 
The procedure for filtration is similar to that already given for the Buchner 
funnel. 

Small volumes of solution (up to 2 ml in one operation) may conveniently be 
filtered through a dropping (Pasteur) pipette into the constriction of which has 
been rammed a small piece of paper tissue (about 3 cm square). The pipette is 
supported vertically and the solution is added from a second Pasteur pipette. 
Pressure to accelerate the filtration process may then be applied from a rubber 
bulb attached to the top of the pipette. 

This method is particularly useful for the preparation of solutions of samples 
for spectroscopic examination where it is important to remove all insoluble 
impurities. The method may be adapted for the decolourisation of small samples 
by incorporating a short column of decolourising carbon above the paper plug 
(cf. Section 2.20). 



2.20 RECRYSTALLISATION TECHNIQUES 

Solid organic compounds when isolated from organic reactions are seldom pure; 
they are usually contaminated with small amounts of other compounds (impuri- 
ties) which are produced along with the desired product. The purification of 
impure crystalline compounds is usually effected by crystallisation from a suit- 
able solvent or mixture of solvents. 

The purification of solids by crystallisation is based upon differences in their 
solubility in a given solvent or mixture of solvents. In its simplest form, the crys- 
tallisation process consists of: (i) dissolving the impure substance in some suit- 
able solvent at or near the boiling point; (ii) filtering the hot solution from 
particles of insoluble material and dust; (iii) allowing the hot solution to cool 

135 



2.20 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



thus causing the dissolved substance to crystallise out; and (iv) separating the 
crystals from the supernatant solution (or mother-liquor). The resulting solid, 
after drying, is tested for purity (usually by a melting point determination, 
Section 2.33, but also by spectroscopic methods, Chapter 3, or by thin-layer 
chromatography, Section 2.31), and if found impure is again recrystallised from 
fresh solvent. The process is repeated until the pure compound is obtained; this 
often means until the melting point is unchanged, but confirmation by the other 
methods specified above is desirable. 

The theory underlying the removal of impurities by crystallisation may be 
understood from the following considerations. It is assumed that the impurities 
are present in comparatively small proportion - usually less than 5 per cent of 
the whole. Let the pure substance be denoted by A and the impurities by B, and 
let the proportion of the latter be assumed to be 5 per cent. In most instances the 
solubilities of A (S A ) and of B (S B ) are different in a particular solvent; the in- 
fluence of each compound upon the solubility of the other will be neglected. Two 
cases will arise for any particular solvent: (i) the impurity is more soluble than 
the compound which is being purified (S B &gt; S A ) and, (ii) the impurity is less 
soluble than the compound (S B &lt; S A ). It is evident that in case (i) several recrys- 
tallisations will give pure sample of A, and B will remain in the mother-liquors. 
Case (ii) can be more clearly illustrated by a specific example. Let us assume that 
the solubilities of A and B in a given solvent at the temperature of the laboratory 
(15 °C) are lOg and 3g per 100ml of solvent respectively. If 50g of the crude 
material (containing 47.5 g of A and 2.5 g of B) are dissolved in 100 ml of the hot 
solvent and the solution allowed to cool to 15 °C, the mother-liquor will contain 
10 g of A and 2.5 g (i.e. the whole) of B; 37.5 g of pure crystals of A will be 
obtained. 

The most desirable characteristics of a solvent for recrystallisation are as 
follows: 

1. A high solvent power for the substance to be purified at elevated temperatures 

and a comparatively low solvent power at the laboratory temperature or 
below. 

2. It should dissolve the impurities readily or to only a very small extent. 

3. It should yield well-formed crystals of the purified compound. 

4. It must be capable of easy removal from the crystals of the purified compound, 

i.e. possess a relatively low boiling point. 

It is assumed, of course, that the solvent does not react chemically with the 
substance to be purified. If two or more solvents appear to be equally suitable 
for recrystallisation, the final selection will depend upon such factors as ease of 
manipulation, toxicity, flammability and cost. 

Some common solvents available for the recrystallisation are collected in 
Table 2.8, broadly in the order of decreasing polarity. Their purification is in- 
cluded in Section 4.1. 

The use of ether as a solvent for recrystallisation should be avoided wherever 
possible, partly owing to its great flammability and partly owing to its tendency 
to creep up walls of the containing vessel, thus depositing solid matter by com- 
plete evaporation instead of preferential crystallisation. Carbon disulphide, b.p. 
46 °C, should never be used if an alternative solvent can be found; it has a dan- 
gerously low flash point and forms very explosive mixtures with air. 

Other recrystallisation solvents include tetrahydrofuran (THF), b.p. 65-66 °C;

The following rough generalisations may assist the student in the selection of 
a solvent for recrystallisation, but it must be clearly understood that numerous 
exceptions are known (for a further discussion see Section 9.2): 

1. A substance is likely to be most soluble in a solvent to which it is most closely 
related in chemical and physical characteristics. 

2. In ascending a homologous series, the solubilities of the members tend to 
become more and more like that of the hydrocarbon from which they may be 
regarded as being derived. 

3. A polar substance is more soluble in polar solvents and less soluble in non- 
polar solvents. The solvents in Table 2.8 have been listed broadly in order of 
decreasing polar character. 

* CAUTION: The vapours of these solvents are toxic and therefore recrystallisations involving their 
use must be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard: excessive inhalation of any vapour should be 
avoided. For notes on cumulative toxic effects refer to Section 2.3. 

t Toluene is much less toxic than benzene and should be used in place of the latter whenever pos- 
sible.

2.20 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



In practice the choice of a solvent for recrystallisation must be determined 
experimentally if no information is already available. About 0. 1 g of the 
powdered substance* is placed in a small test tube (75 x 11mm or 110 x 
12 mm) and the solvent is added a drop at a time with continuous shaking of the 
test tube. After about 1 ml of the solvent has been added, the mixture is heated to 
boiling, due precautions being taken if the solvent is flammable. If the sample 
dissolves easily in 1 ml of cold solvent or upon gentle warming, the solvent is un- 
suitable. If all the solid does not dissolve, more solvent is added in 0.5 ml por- 
tions, and again heated to boiling after each addition. If 3 ml of solvent is added 
and the substance does not dissolve on heating, the substance is regarded as 
sparingly soluble in that solvent, and another solvent should be sought. If the 
compound dissolves (or almost completely dissolves!) i n tne hot solvent, the 
tube is cooled to determine whether crystallisation occurs. If crystallisation does 
not take place rapidly, this may be due to the absence of suitable nuclei for crys- 
tal growth. The tube should be scratched below the surface of the solution with a 
glass rod; the fine scratches on the walls (and the minute fragments of glass pro- 
duced) may serve as excellent nuclei for crystal growth. If crystals do not separ- 
ate, even after scratching for several minutes and cooling in an ice-salt mixture, 
the solvent is rejected. If crystals separate, the amount of these should be noted. 
The process may be repeated with other possible solvents, using a fresh test tube 
for each experiment, until the best solvent is found; the approximate proportions 
of the solute and solvent giving the most satisfactory results should be recorded. 

If the substance is found to be far too soluble in one solvent and much too 
insoluble in another solvent to allow of recrystallisation, mixed solvents or 
'solvent pairs' may frequently be used with excellent results. The two solvents 
must, of course, be completely miscible.J Recrystallisation from mixed solvents 
is carried out near the boiling point of the mixture. The compound is dissolved 
in the solvent in which it is very soluble, and the hot solvent, in which the sub- 
stance is only sparingly soluble, is added cautiously until a slight turbidity is 
produced. The turbidity is then just cleared by the addition of a small quantity 
of the first solvent and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature; crys- 
tals will separate. Pairs of liquids which may be used include: alcohols and 
water; alcohols and toluene; toluene and light petroleum; acetone and light 
petroleum; diethyl ether and pentane; glacial acetic acid and water; dimethyl- 
formamide with either water or toluene. 

When the best solvent or solvent mixture and the appropriate proportions of 
solute and solvent have been determined by these preliminary tests or have been 
obtained from reference books containing solubility data, 39,40 the solid sub- 
stance is placed in a round-bottomed flask of suitable size fitted with a reflux 
condenser (Fig. 2.54) and slightly less than the required quantity of solvent is 
added together with a few pieces of porous porcelain to prevent 'bumping' (see 

* With practice the student should be able readily to perform trial recrystallisations with much 
smaller quantities of material (e.g. 5 mg) using a small ignition or centrifuge tube and correspond- 
ingly smaller quantities of solvents. 

t If the crude substance contains an insoluble impurity, difficulty may be experienced at a later stage 
in estimating how much solute has crystallised from the cold solution. The hot solution should there- 
fore be filtered into another tube through a very small fluted filter paper contained in a small short- 
stemmed funnel. The solution must always be clear before cooling is attempted. 
J Solvent pairs selected from the extremes of the list Table 2.8 are not usually sufficiently miscible to 
be satisfactory, e.g. methanol and light petroleum.

Section 2.24). The mixture is heated to boiling on a water bath (if the solvent 
boils below 80 °C) or with an electric heating mantle, and more solvent is added 
down the condenser until a clear solution, apart from insoluble impurities*, is 
produced. If the solvent is not flammable, toxic or expensive, recrystallisation 
may be carried out in a conical flask, into the neck of which a funnel with a short 
stem is inserted, which is heated on an electric plate. 

FILTRATION OF THE HOT SOLUTION 

The boiling or hot solution must be rapidly filtered before undue cooling has 
occurred. (If a flammable solvent has been used, all flames in the vicinity must be 
extinguished.) This is usually done through a fluted filter paper (see below) sup- 
ported in a relatively large funnel with a short wide stem; separation of crystals 
in and clogging of the stem is thus reduced to a minimum. The funnel should be 
warmed in an electric or steam oven before filtration is started, when it should be 
supported in a conical flask of sufficient size to hold all the solution; the conical 
flask is stood on an electric hotplate or steam bath and the filtrate is kept boiling 
gently so that the warm solvent vapours maintain the temperature of the solution 
undergoing filtration, and thus prevent premature deposition of crystals on the 
filter or in the neck of the funnel. If solid does separate out on the filter it must be 
scraped back into the first flask, redissolved and refiltered. The filtered solution 
is covered with a watch- or clock-glass, and then set aside to cool undisturbed. If 
large crystals are desired, any solid which may have separated from the filtered 
solution should be redissolved by warming (a reflux condenser must be used for 
a flammable solvent), the flask wrapped in a towel or cloth, and allowed to cool 
slowly. If small crystals are required, the hot saturated solution should be stirred 
vigorously and cooled rapidly in a bath of cold water or of ice. It should be 
noted that large crystals are not necessarily purer than small ones; generally very 
impure substances are best purified by slow recrystallisation to give large crys- 
tals, followed by several rapid recrystallisations to give small crystals. 

If large quantities of hot solution are to be filtered, the funnel (and fluted filter 
paper) should be warmed externally during the filtration. The heating mantle 
illustrated in Fig. 2.47(c) is particularly suitable, using the lower heating ele- 
ment; no flames should be present while flammable solvents are being filtered 
through this funnel. When dealing with considerable volumes of aqueous or 
other solutions which do not deposit crystals rapidly on cooling, a Buchner 
funnel preheated in an oven may be used for filtration (see Section 2.19). The 
filter paper should be of close-grained texture and should be wetted with solvent 
before suction is applied; the solution may then be poured on to the filter. 

PREPARATION OF A FLUTED FILTER PAPER 

The filter paper is first folded in half and again in quarters, and opened up as 
shown in Fig. 2.80(a). The edge 2,1 is then folded on to 2,4 and edge 2,3 on to 2,4, 
producing, when the paper is opened, new folds at 2,5 and 2,6. The folding is 
continued, 2,1 to 2,6 and 2,3 to 2,5, thus producing folds at 2,7 and 2,8 respect- 
ively (Fig. 2.80(b)); further 2,3 to 2,6 giving 2,9, and 2,1 to 2,5 giving 2,10 (Fig. 
2.80(c)). The final operation consists in making a fold in each of the eight seg- 
ments - between 2,3 and 2,9, between 2,9 and 2,6, etc. - in a direction opposite to

correctly interpreted.

the first series of folds, i.e. the folds are made outwards instead of inwards as at 
first. The result is a fan arrangement (Fig. 2.80(d)), and upon opening, the fluted 
paper (Fig. 2.80(e)) is obtained. 

USE OF DECOLOURISING CARBON 

The crude product of an organic reaction may contain a coloured impurity. 
Upon recrystallisation, this impurity may dissolve in the boiling solvent and be 
partly adsorbed by the crystals as they separate upon cooling, yielding a 
coloured product. Sometimes the solution is slightly turbid owing to the pres- 
ence of a little resinous matter or a very fine suspension of an insoluble impurity, 
which cannot always be removed by simple filtration. These impurities can be 
removed by boiling the substance in solution with a little decolourising charcoal 
for 5-10 minutes, and then filtering the solution while hot as described above. 
The decolourising charcoal adsorbs the coloured impurity and holds back 
resinous, finely divided matter, and the filtrate is usually free from extraneous 
colour, and therefore deposits pure crystals. The decolourisation takes place 
most readily in aqueous solution but can be performed in almost any organic 
solvent; the process is least effective in hydrocarbon solvents. It must be pointed 
out that boiling in a solvent with decolourising carbon is not always the most 
effective method of removing the colour; if this is only partially effective, it is 
often worth while to pass the cold solution of the substance (preferably in an 
organic solvent such as ethanol) through a small amount of decolourising car- 
bon supported on a wad of cotton wool in the stem of a funnel - this is effectively 
a chromatographic procedure. 

An excessive quantity of decolourising agent must be avoided, since it may 
also adsorb some of the compound which is being purified. The exact quantity 
to be added will depend upon the amount of impurities present; for most pur- 
poses 1-2 per cent by weight of the crude solid will be found satisfactory. If this 
quantity is insufficient, the operation should be repeated with a further 1-2 per 
cent of fresh decolourising charcoal. Sometimes a little charcoal passes through 
the close-grained filter paper; the addition, before filtration of a filter aid (filter- 
paper pulp or Celite), will give a clear filtrate. Attention is directed to the fact 
that the decolourising charcoal should not be added to a superheated solution 
as the latter may foam excessively and boil over. Excellent decolourising car- 
bons are marketed under the trade names 'Norit' (from birch wood), 'Darco' 
and 'Nuchar', and are widely available.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.20 



DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED IN RECRYSTALLISATION 

The separation of a second liquid phase, commonly known as an 'oil', instead of 
the expected crystalline solid, sometimes occurs during recrystallisation. The oil 
often solidifies on standing, although at times a considerable period may elapse 
before crystallisation occurs. The resulting crystals will probably occlude some 
of the mother-liquor, and the purity will therefore not be high. The separation of 
the oil may be avoided by diluting the solution considerably, but this will lead to 
large losses. It is probably best to re-heat the mixture until a clear solution is 
obtained, and allow it to cool spontaneously; immediately the oil commences to 
separate, the mixture is vigorously stirred so that the oil is well dispersed in the 
solution. Eventually, crystals will separate and these will grow in the bulk of the 
solution and not in a pool of oil, so that occlusion of the mother-liquor is con- 
siderably reduced. When all the oil has disappeared, stirring may be stopped and 
the crystals allowed to accumulate. Sometimes the addition of a minute quantity 
of the crude compound in order to 'seed' the solution may facilitate the initial 
crystallisation. 

Occasionally substances form supersaturated solutions from which the first 
crystals separate with difficulty; this is sometimes caused by the presence of a 
little tar or viscous substance acting as a protective colloid. The following 
methods should be tried in order to induce crystallisation: 

1. By scratching the inside of the vessel with a glass rod. The effect is attributed 
to the breaking off of small particles of glass which may act as crystal nuclei, 
or to the roughening of the surface, which facilitates more rapid orientation of 
the crystals on the surface. 

2. By inoculating {seeding) the solution with some of the solid material or with 
isomorphous crystals, crystallisation frequently commences and continues 
until equilibrium is reached. The 'seed crystals' may be obtained by cooling a 
very thin film of liquid to a low temperature. Several drops of the solution are 
placed in a test tube or beaker and spread into a thin film by rotating the con- 
tainer, the latter is then cooled in a mixture of ice and salt or in some other 
suitable freezing mixture. A better procedure, which avoids the necessity of 
subsequently scraping the surface to remove the 'seed crystals' and the 
attendant melting if the compound is impure or of low melting point, is to 
moisten a small glass bead with the supersaturated solution, place it in a test 
tube, cool the latter in a freezing mixture and thus form crystals on the surface 
of the bead. The glass bead can then be rolled out of the tube into the vessel 
containing the main bulk of the solution. Seed crystals may sometimes be 
formed when a few drops of the solution are placed on a watch glass and the 
solvent is gradually allowed to evaporate while at the same time the film is 
rubbed with a glass rod. 

3. By cooling the solution in a freezing mixture (ice and salt, ice and calcium 
chloride, or solid carbon dioxide and acetone). It must be borne in mind that 
the rate of crystal formation is inversely proportional to the temperature; 
cooling to very low temperatures may render the mass very viscous and thus 
considerably hinder crystallisation. In such a case, the mixture should be 
allowed to warm slowly so that it may be given the opportunity to form crys- 
tals if it passes through an optimum temperature region for crystal formation. 
Once minute crystals have been formed, it is very probable that their size will 
be increased by keeping the mixture at a somewhat higher temperature. 

141 



2.20 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



4. By adding a few lumps of solid carbon dioxide; this produces a number of cold 
spots here and there, and assists the formation of crystals. 

5. If all the above methods fail, the solution should be left in an ice chest (or a 
refrigerator) for a prolonged period. The exercise of considerable patience is 
sometimes necessary so as to give the solute every opportunity to crystallise. 

The product of a chemical reaction which has been isolated by solvent extrac- 
tion and subsequent removal of solvent (see Sections 2.22 and 2.24), and which 
normally should be crystalline, is sometimes an oil due to the presence of impur- 
ities. It is usually advisable to attempt to induce the oil to crystallise before puri- 
fying it by recrystallisation. Methods 1 and 2 (previous paragraph) may be 
applied; method 2 cannot always be used because of the difficulty of securing the 
necessary seed crystals, but should these be available, successful results will 
usually be obtained. Another procedure is to add a small quantity of an organic 
solvent in which the compound is sparingly soluble or insoluble, and then to rub 
with a stirring rod or grind in a mortar until crystals appear; it may be necessary 
to continue the rubbing for an hour before signs of solidification are apparent. 
Another useful expedient is to leave the oil in a vacuum desiccator over silica gel 
or some other drying agent. If all the above methods fail to induce crystallis- 
ation, direct recrystallisation may be attempted: the solution should be boiled 
with decolourising carbon as this may remove some of the impurities respons- 
ible for the difficulty of crystal formation. Occasionally, conversion into a simple 
crystalline derivative is applicable; subsequent regeneration of the original com- 
pound will usually yield a pure, crystalline solid. Instances will occur however 
when assessment by thin-layer chromatography (Section 2.31) of the number of 
probable impurities in the isolated reaction mixture and of their relative 
amounts is advisable. It may then be judged whether some prior purification by 
suitable preparative chromatography (Section 2.31) or by solvent extraction 
(Section 2.22), should be performed before crystallisation is attempted. 

The technique for the removal of solids by nitration with suction has already 
been described (Section 2.19). The same technique will of course be applied to 
the collection of recrystallised compounds. Additionally, however, it should be 
noted that the mother-liquor from a recrystallisation is often of value for the re- 
covery of further quantities of product, and should be transferred to another 
vessel after the crystals have been drained and washed with solvent. The mother- 
liquor may be then subsequently concentrated (Section 2.24; suitable pre- 
cautions being taken, of course, if the solvent is flammable), and a further crop of 
crystals obtained. Occasionally yet another crop may be produced. The crops 
thus isolated are generally less pure than the first crystals which separate, and 
they should be combined and recrystallised from fresh solvent; the purity is 
checked by a melting point determination. 

After the main filtrate has been removed for such treatment, the crystals on 
the filter pad should be washed to remove remaining traces of mother-liquor 
which, on drying, would contaminate the crystals. The wash liquid will normally 
be the same solvent or solvent mixture used for recrystallisation and must be 
used in the smallest amount compatible with efficient washing, in order to pre- 
vent appreciable loss of the solid. With the suction discontinued the crystals are 
treated with a small volume of the chilled solvent and cautiously stirred with a 
spatula or with a flattened glass rod (without loosening the filter paper) so that 
the solvent wets all the crystals. The suction is then applied again, and the crys- 

142 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.20 



tals are pressed down with a wide glass stopper as before. The washing is re- 
peated, if necessary, after connection to the filter pump has again been broken. 
If the solvent constituting the crystallisation medium has a comparatively 
high boiling point, it is advisable to wash the solid with a solvent of low boiling 
point in order that the ultimate crystalline product may be easily dried; it need 
hardly be added that the crystals should be insoluble or only very sparingly 
soluble in the volatile solvent. The new solvent must be completely miscible with 
the first, and should not be applied until crystals have been washed at least once 
with the original solvent. 

RECRYSTALLISATION AT VERY LOW TEMPERATURES 

This technique is necessary either when the solubility of the compound in the 
requisite solvent is too high at ordinarily obtained temperatures (refrigerator to 
room temperatures) for recovery to be economic, or when handling compounds 
which are liquid at room temperature but which may be recrystallised from a 
solvent maintained at much lower temperatures (say —10 to — 40 °C). In this 
latter case, after several successive low temperature recrystallisations, the com- 
pound will revert to a liquid on storage at room temperature, but the purifica- 
tion process by recrystallisation will have been achieved. 

The following crude, but none the less relatively effective, procedure may be 
adopted in those cases where the compound is not moisture sensitive, and where 
the amount of product is relatively large (say 5 to 50 g). A round-bottomed or 
conical flask protected with a calcium chloride tube and containing the solvent 
in which the compound has been previously dissolved is placed in a suitable 
cooling mixture (see Section 2.12) until crystallisation is complete. A second 
flask, also protected by a calcium chloride tube and containing the washing sol- 
vent, is also chilled in the same cooling bath. A Buchner funnel is fitted with a 
suitable filter paper, attached to the filter flask and filled with powdered solid 
carbon dioxide. Immediately prior to filtration the solid carbon dioxide is tipped 
out (for very low temperature filtrations some proportion of the solid carbon 
dioxide may be retained in the funnel since this helps to maintain the low tem- 
perature of the filtering mixture) and the solution is filtered as rapidly as pos- 
sible using the previously chilled solvent for rinsing and washing. One must 
work as rapidly as possible, returning the flasks to the cooling bath at every 
opportunity and ensuring that before pouring from either flask the outside is 
wiped with a cloth, otherwise some drops of the cooling-bath mixture may drain 
on to the filter cake. 

It will be clear from the above account that recrystallisation and filtration at 
low temperatures are attended by two inherent difficulties: (1) moisture is 
rapidly deposited on the chilled compound, the solvent and the Buchner funnel, 
and (2) it is difficult to maintain the apparatus, product and solvent at the 
required temperature throughout the filtration process. 

To overcome these difficulties some ingenuity in apparatus design is neces- 
sary, and Fig. 2.81 illustrates one possible assembly. 

Here a three-necked, pear-shaped flask A is fitted with a condenser and cal- 
cium chloride tube B, a filter stick* C (this being a glass tube having a sintered 

* Filter sticks of a range of dimensions and porosities are available from J. Bibby Science Products 
Ltd. The choice of size of flasks and filter sticks will be governed by the scale of the recrystallisation. 
Broadly speaking pear-shaped flasks are more suitable for the range lOOmg to 5g, but may be re- 
placed by round-bottomed flasks for operations on a larger scale.

glass frit at its end), a stirrer guide D with flexible rubber or polythene tubing to 
allow vertical and circular movements of the filter stick, a two-necked flask E 
fitted with a nitrogen gas inlet system, and a delivery tube (with stopcock) F. 
The thoroughly dried assembled apparatus, containing the compound to be 
recrystallised in flask A and with the filter stick drawn into the upper part of the 
flask, is flushed through with nitrogen. The nitrogen inlet tube is removed, sol- 
vent is introduced into flask E, the nitrogen inlet tube is replaced, and by suit- 
able control of the stopcock F (1) the required amount of solvent is allowed to 
flow into flask A (2). Flask A is now heated by suitable means until solution of 
the compound is complete, and the liquors are allowed to cool to near room 
temperature before both flasks A and E are immersed in the appropriate cooling 
bath. When recrystallisation is complete, the filter stick C is lowered to the level 
of the mother-liquors and suction applied slowly (3). The horizontal and circu- 
lar movement allowed by the flexible connection D enables the crystalline solid 
to be pressed down into a filter cake and the mother-liquor to be efficiently 
removed. Without disconnecting the suction, washing solvent is allowed to flow 
into the flask A; by adjustment of the position of the delivery tube it is possible 
to direct solvent flow on to the outside of the filter-stick tube in order to remove 
contaminating mother-liquor. These initial washings also serve the purpose of 
rinsing the inside of the filter stick so that subsequent drainage which may occur 
when suction is discontinued will not cause contamination of the crystalline 
material. If further washing is required the suction is discontinued and the sol- 
vent allowed to flow on to the crystals which are stirred with the filter stick; 
finally suction is reapplied. Further recrystallisations may of course be carried 
out without removal of material from flask A. The entire assembly should be 
allowed finally to reach room temperature with the dry atmosphere maintained 
within, so that when the apparatus is disconnected the purified product will not 
be contaminated with condensing water vapour from the laboratory atmo- 
sphere. 

Notes. (1) The nitrogen inlet system should be of the type suggested in Fig. 2.60 with a 
sufficiently great enough head of mercury or mineral oil in the escape valve to force the 
solvent from flask E to A. Control of solvent flow should be by stopcock F, and the outlet 
of the solvent delivery tube should be above the final level of solution. 



144 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.20 



(2) The amount of solvent used will have been estimated from the trial recrystallisa- 
tions carried out in ignition or test tubes using a cooling bath to effect crystallisation. 

(3) The filter stick should be attached to a suction pump via a filter trap so that the 
mother-liquor may be collected, and, if need be, concentrated for further crystal crops; 
furthermore it is essential that the suction be carefully controlled (by the use of additional 
stopcocks which are not shown) so that the filter stick may be lowered at the same rate as 
the level of mother-liquor falls. Undue immersion of the filter stick leads to some trouble- 
some difficulties in removing contaminating mother-liquor from the outside of the filter 
stick. 

RECRYSTALLISATION IN AN INERT ATMOSPHERE 

Substances which decompose, or otherwise undergo structural modification, on 
contact with air must be recrystallised in an indifferent atmosphere, which is 
usually nitrogen but may on occasions be carbon dioxide, or rarely, hydrogen 
(see Section 2.17.8, for hazards). The apparatus assembly shown in Fig. 2.81 is 
suitable with the modification that the calcium chloride tube is replaced by a 
second nitrogen inlet system. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, and the 
solid material is quickly transferred to flask A; the apparatus is flushed with 
nitrogen before solvent transfer from flask E to A is carried out. Subsequent 
operations are as described above using such cooling methods as are appropri- 
ate to the recrystallisation process. Finally the material is thoroughly dried 
under nitrogen in flask A by allowing the gas to pass through the system before 
the apparatus is disconnected. Short periods of exposure of the crystalline 
material to the atmosphere is not always harmful and hence it may usually be 
transferred rapidly to a suitable container for storage under nitrogen (e.g., a 
nitrogen-filled desiccator). 

In those cases where even a short exposure to the atmosphere is harmful, the 
recrystallisation and filtration processes may be carried out in a nitrogen-filled 
manipulator glove box (available, for example, from Gallenkamp, Miller-Howe) 
which has been adapted to accommodate the services required for a normal 
recrystallisation procedure. The size of the glove box itself and the dimensions of 
the outlet panels will naturally limit the scale on which recrystallisation can be 
carried out in this manner. 

TECHNIQUE OF SEMIMICRO AND MICRO RECRYSTALLISATIONS 

The student in the later stages of his training will certainly be required to recrys- 
tallise quantities of solid material within the range of 1 g to fractions of a milli- 
gram. These small quantities could arise from: (i) small-scale preparations 
involving very expensive materials; (ii) preparations of derivatives of small 
amounts of natural products; (iii) by-products isolated from a reaction process; 
(iv) chromatographic separation procedures (column and thin-layer tech- 
niques), etc. For convenience the experimental procedure to be adopted for 
recrystallisation of small quantities may be described under three groups: 

1. A scale in the range of 1 g to 20 mg. 

2. A scale in the range of 20 mg to 1 mg. 

3. A scale below 1 mg. 

The scale of the recrystallisation envisaged in group (1) means that the opera- 
tions are carried out in the conventional manner but in apparatus of reduced 
size. Thus small conical flasks (5 to 20 ml), pear-shaped flasks (5 to 20 ml), semi- 
micro test tubes (75 x 10 mm or 100 x 12 mm) or centrifuge tubes (1 to 5 ml) 

145 



2.20 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



are employed; it is best that the solutions in these receptacles be heated on a 
water or oil bath rather than directly with a semimicro burner since the heating 
process can thus be better controlled. Operations involving hot flammable sol- 
vents should be performed under reflux using semimicro interchangeable 
ground glass joint apparatus (7/11 and 10/19). The crystals which separate on 
cooling are removed by filtration using a small Hirsch funnel, or a small conical 
glass funnel fitted with a perforated or sintered glass filtration plate; it is often 
advantageous to place a small filter paper upon the sintered glass plate since 
complete removal of the crystalline material is thus facilitated. Typical filtration 
assemblies are shown in Figs 2.82 and 2.43(f). In Fig. 2.82 a rubber cone is used 
with the Hirsch funnel and boiling tube (150 x 25 mm) having a side-arm for 
attachment to the suction pump; the filtrate is collected in a centrifuge tube or in 
a semimicro test tube resting upon a wad of cotton wool. In Fig. 2.43(f) the 
assembly incorporates ground glass joints and is suitable for the 20-1 00 mg 
scale. 

An apparatus for the filtration of quantities of crystals within the scale of 
both groups (1) and (2) incorporates the so-called Willstdtter 'filtration naiV. The 
latter consists of a thin glass rod flattened at one end. It is readily constructed by 
heating the end of a short glass rod in the blowpipe flame and pressing vertically 
upon a heat resistant board. The 'nail' is fitted into a small glass funnel (Fig. 
2.83(a)) which is attached to the filter tube by a rubber ring or cone, or the 
funnel may incorporate a ground glass joint. The nail head may be covered with 
a circle of filter paper cut with the aid of a cork borer of appropriate size; alter- 
natively, with a good fit between the nail-head edge and the funnel surface and 
with well-formed crystals, an initial layer of crystals is held at the join and pro- 
vides a filter medium. The latter technique is valuable for the final stages in the 
preparation of dust- and fibre-free samples for subsequent elemental analysis. 
The dimensions given in Fig. 2.83(a) are a guide to the construction of a 'filtra- 
tion nail' and funnel capable of handling up to 1 g of solid; a smaller size will 
handle correspondingly smaller quantities (20 mg) just as efficiently. It is often 
convenient to make several 'nails' with different sized heads which will fit a 
single funnel so that the 'nail' and filter-paper diameter appropriate to the 
amount of solid to be collected may be employed. For the larger sizes of 'nail' 
which accommodate filter papers of 15-25 mm diameter, it is advisable to corru- 
gate the head of the 'nail' as shown (somewhat exaggerated) in Fig. 2.83(b) in

order to permit drainage of nitrate over the entire paper; these corrugations are 
easily produced by pressing the hot glass on the surface of an old single-cut file 
of coarse grade. 

Should it be necessary, before crystallisation takes place, to filter the hot or 
boiling solutions to remove dust, fibre, etc., the Pyrex micro filter (8 ml capacity) 
shown in Fig. 2.84 is suitable since the long cylindrical tube reduces evap- 
oration. The filter would be used in an assembly similar to that shown in 
Fig. 2.82. 

It is clear that when the scale of the operation falls within group (2) (20 mg to 
1 mg), losses arising from transference of material from flask to filter become 
more serious and contamination by dirt and filter-paper fibre more likely. 
For these reasons one of the following variations in technique should be 
employed. 

The solution and crystallisation processes may be conducted in a centrifuge 
tube; when crystallisation is complete the tube and its contents should be centri- 
fuged (with a suitable hand-operated or electric centrifuge) to pack the crystal- 
line mass. Filtration is now performed by introducing the end of a dropper 
pipette (previously drawn out to a capillary of approximately 0. 1 mm diameter), 
down the inside surface of the centrifuge tube until it reaches the bottom; in this 
way there is less chance of breakage of the capillary because of the support pro- 
vided by the side of the tube. The mother-liquor is now drawn into the pipette, 
the capillary end serving as the filter. Drops of washing solvent from another 
dropper pipette are now directed, first to the inside of the tube contaminated 
with mother-liquor, and then on to the surface of the crystalline mass. The sol- 
vent percolates through the crystalline mass and is drawn up into the capillary - 
the filled capillary pipette is withdrawn and returned empty as frequently as is 
necessary. Further recrystallisation may be performed without removing the 
solid from the centrifuge tube, and finally the centrifuge tube containing the pur- 
ified compound is placed in a vacuum desiccator or drying pistol. When com- 
pletely solvent-free it will be found that the product may be cleanly removed 
from the centrifuge tube. 

When the volume of solvent required for the recrystallisation is large, com- 
pared to the quantity of solid material, initial removal of mother-liquor from the 
centrifuge tube by this capillary pipette method may be tedious. In such a case, 
centrifugation should be more prolonged to get more effective packing of the 



ra

solid, and the bulk of mother-liquor may be drained without disturbance of the 
solid by inverting the tube over another receptacle in a smooth jerk -free motion. 
While the tube is in the inverted position the lip is now rinsed with solvent from 
a dropper pipette; finally wash solvent is introduced into the tube and on to the 
solid. Subsequent nitration may now be by the capillary-ended pipette as de- 
scribed above. 

An alternative means of nitration of quantities of material in the 1 to 5 mg 
region is to effect solution and crystallisation in a narrow glass tube (6 mm) 
sealed at one end and with a slight constriction sited at such a position to give 
the required capacity. After crystallisation is complete, a glass rod flattened at 
one end to give a type of Willstatter 'nail' (Fig. 2.85(a)) is introduced, the tube is 
inverted into a centrifuge tube (Fig. 2.85(b)) and the whole is centrifuged. Wash- 
ing may be effected by removing the 'nail' from the crystallisation tube, intro- 
ducing wash solvent with a capillary pipette, reintroducing the 'nail' and filtering 
by centrifuging in the inverted position as before. 

Where a recrystallisation has been conducted in a centrifuge or small di- 
ameter tube and too much solvent has been added initially, concentration of the 
solution may be effected by the following technique. A small carborundum chip 
is introduced and the tube is heated very carefully over a water or oil bath of 
suitable temperature to give gentle boiling. A flow of nitrogen is directed to the 
surface of the boiling liquid by means of a capillary-end pipette; the process is 
continued until the required concentration is effected. The technique of concen- 
tration may also be used in those cases where further crystalline crops are 
required from the mother-liquor. 

Where it is clear that the solid to be purified contains dust, or insoluble 
impurities, then it is necessary to use initially a greater volume of solvent (to pre- 
vent prior crystallisation) and to filter the solution in the micro-filter shown in 
Fig. 2.84. The filtered solution is concentrated using the technique described 
above until the required smaller volume is reached using first, if necessary, larger 
test tubes and transferring in stages the concentrated solutions by dropper 
pipettes to finally the centrifuge or small diameter tube of an appropriate size. 

It should be emphasised that in all these operations the laboratory worker 
should have readily to hand racks, retort stands, clamps and bosses to hold and 
support the centrifuge tubes and dropping pipettes, and watch glasses to cover 
tube ends and prevent the entry of dust. 

Recrystallisation of quantities of materials less than 1 mg (group (3)) is 
carried out in melting point or capillary tubes (e.g. 1.5 mm diameter), and is a 
much simpler operation than might be imagined. All manipulations should be 
carried out on a bench top covered with a piece of white glazed card or opaque 
glass. This ensures that all dust and dirt may be immediately observed and 
removed, and that the glass apparatus does not accidentally pick up dirt, bench 
polish, etc., small quantities of which could seriously contaminate the product. 

The solid is introduced into one of the two open ends of the capillary tube 
(c 1 mm i.d.) by pushing the end into the solid contained in a specimen tube or 
on a watch glass. The solvent is introduced by holding the same open end of the 
capillary tube against a drop of solvent suspended from the end of a capillary 
dropping pipette. The amount of solvent taken up depends on the balance 
between surface tension and capillary forces, and the force of gravity, which in 
turn is determined by the angle at which the capillary tube is held and by the 
portion of the suspended drop which is touched by the capillary end. In general 



148 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.20 



a horizontally-held tube rapidly takes up a column of several centimetres of 
liquid, while a tube held vertically over the top of a suspended drop takes up 
only a few millimetres of liquid. Practice with empty tubes results in the tech- 
nique of solvent introduction being easily acquired. The solute/solvent-free end 
is now sealed in the flame of a micro-burner, allowed to cool, and the tube con- 
tents transferred to the newly sealed end by placing the capillary tube in a centri- 
fuge tube and centrifuging. It is advisable to cover the centrifuge tube with a soft 
rubber cap through which some pin holes have been pierced; the capillary tubes 
inserted through these holes are then supported adequately to prevent breakage. 
The open end is now washed clean by the introduction of more solvent. This is 
accomplished by passing the midsection of the tube through a micro-burner 
flame and then introducing the end into a drop of liquid; as the tube cools liquid 
is drawn into the tube. This additional liquid may be centrifuged down, or if not 
required to augment the volume of solvent already present it may be removed 
from the tube by wrapping the open end in a filter or paper tissue and passing 
the midsection of the tube again through the micro-burner flame. The cleaned 
end is now sealed, and solution of the solute in the solvent effected by immersing 
the end of the tube in an appropriate heating bath. The tube is now cooled and 
when crystallisation is complete [a cooling bath (1) may be necessary to induce 
crystallisation], the tube is centrifuged to compact the crystalline mass. Removal 
of mother-liquor may be achieved by cutting off the top of the capillary tube (2) 
and using a very fine capillary pipette; washing solvent is introduced by another 
capillary pipette. Finally the end of the tube containing the purified solid may be 
severed, dried in a vacuum desiccator, and the contents removed by holding the 
glass section in a pair of tweezers and using a short piece of platinum wire sealed 
into a glass rod as a spatula. 

Notes. (1) For the support of these tubes in heating and cooling baths it is recommended 
that the top of the bath be covered with a wire mesh large enough to allow insertion of the 
tube; the upper end of the tube should be pushed into a small rubber collar which then 
allows the tube to be suspended satisfactorily. 

(2) Scratching of tube of this size is accomplished by a carborundum glass cutter, which is 
easily constructed by fusing a carborundum chip in the end of a glass rod. Alternatively a 
diamond pencil may be used. 

DRYING OF RECRYSTALLISED MATERIAL 

The conditions for drying recrystallised material depend upon the quantity of 
product, the nature of the solvent to be removed and the sensitivity of the prod- 
uct to heat and to the atmosphere. 

With large-scale preparations of stable compounds, moist with non-toxic sol- 
vents which are volatile at room temperature (e.g. water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, 
acetone), the Buchner funnel is inverted over two or three thicknesses of drying 
paper (i.e. coarse-grained, smooth-surfaced filter paper) resting upon a pad of 
newspaper, and the crystalline cake removed with the aid of a clean spatula; 
several sheets of drying paper are placed on top and the crystals are pressed 
firmly. If the sheets become too damp with solvent, the crystals should be trans- 
ferred to fresh paper. The crystals are then covered by a piece of filter paper per- 
forated with a number of holes or with a large clock glass or sheet of glass 
supported upon corks. The air drying is continued until only traces of solvent 
remain (usually detected by smell or appearance) and final drying is accom- 
plished by placing the solid in an electric oven controlled at a suitable tempera- 

149 



2.20 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ture.* The disadvantage of this method of drying is that the crystallised product 
is liable to become contaminated with filter-paper fibre. 

With smaller amounts (e.g. l-20g) of more valuable recrystallised material 
the filter cake is transferred to a tared watch glass, broken down into small frag- 
ments without damaging the crystalline form, and air dried under another suit- 
ably supported watch glass before being placed into a temperature-controlled 
oven. 

With low melting solids, the best method of drying is to place the crystals on a 
watch glass in a desiccator (Section 2. 1 1) charged with an appropriate substance 
to absorb the solvent. For general purposes, water vapour is absorbed by a 
charge of granular calcium chloride, concentrated sulphuric acidf or silica gel. J 
Methanol and ethanol vapours are absorbed by granular calcium chloride or 
silica gel. Vapours from diethyl ether, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, ben- 
zene, toluene, light petroleum and similar solvents are absorbed by a charge of 
freshly cut shavings of paraffin wax; since the sample may contain traces of 
moisture, it is advisable to insert also a dish containing a suitable desiccant. If 
the compound is moist with glacial acetic acid (e.g. from a recrystallisation of 
some 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones), or with concentrated hydrochloric acid 
(e.g. from a recrystallisation of an amine hydrochloride), a dual charge of silica 
gel or concentrated sulphuric acid together with a separate receptacle contain- 
ing flake sodium hydroxide is necessary to absorb the water and acid vapours 
respectively. Samples which are to be used subsequently in reactions requiring 
anhydrous conditions are best dried in a desiccator charged with phosphoric 
oxide.§ 

Drying is more rapid in a vacuum desiccator of the design shown in Section 
2.11. When exhausting a desiccator a filter flask trap should always be inserted 
between the desiccator and the pump. The vacuum should be applied gradually 
and the precaution taken of surrounding the desiccator by a cage of fine-mesh 
steel wire (DesiguardU); the collapse of the desiccator will then do no harm. 

When using a vacuum desiccator, the vessel containing the substance (clock 
glass, etc.) should be covered with an inverted clock glass. This will protect the 
finer crystals from being swept away should the air, accidentally, be rapidly ad- 
mitted to the desiccator. In actual practice the tube inside the desiccator leading 
from the stopcock is bent so that the open end points in the direction of the lid, 
hence if the tap is only slightly opened and air allowed to enter slowly, there is 
little danger of the solid being blown from the clock glass or other receptacle. 

* Many students place carefully recrystallised samples into a heated oven maintained at a tempera- 
ture higher than the melting point of their solid with inevitable results; this leads to undue waste of 
effort and chemicals. Even if the melting point is known, it is always advisable to make a trial with a 
small quantity on a watch glass. In fact, a temperature of about 50 °C over a period of 1-2 hours is 
usually adequate for the removal of the common organic solvents mentioned in Table 2.8. If the 
material can be left overnight at this temperature complete removal of water will occur, 
t If a solution of 1 8 g of barium sulphate in 1 litre of concentrated sulphuric acid is employed, a pre- 
cipitate of barium sulphate will form when sufficient water has been absorbed to render it unfit for 
drying; recharging will then, of course, be necessary. 

J It is usual to employ blue self-indicating silica gel crystals which turn a pale pink colour when re- 
generation by heating in an electric oven is required. 

§ Phosphoric oxide coated on an inert carrier is available from B.D.H. and other suppliers, and is an 
efficient agent for desiccators. An indicator is incorporated which turns from colourless to blue as 
water absorption increases.

Frequently the water or other solvent is so firmly held that it cannot be com- 
pletely removed in a vacuum desiccator at ordinary temperatures. Large quanti- 
ties of material (100 g upwards) must therefore be dried in a vacuum oven at 
higher temperatures, using one of the commercial designs which are available. 
For smaller amounts of recrystallised material a convenient laboratory form of 
vacuum oven is the so-called 'drying pistoF. An interchangeable glass joint as- 
sembly* is shown in Fig. 2.86 where vapour from a boiling liquid in the flask A 
rises through the jacket surrounding the drying chamber B (holding the sub- 
stance) and returns to the flask from the condenser; the drying chamber B is con- 
nected to the vessel C containing the drying agent; C is attached to a suction 
pump. The liquid in A is selected according to the temperature required, e.g. 
chloroform (61 °C), trichloroethylene (86 °C), water (100 °C), perchloroethylene 
(120 °C), 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (147 °C), etc. The charge in C consists of 
phosphoric oxide distributed on glass woolf (to prevent 'caking') when water is 
to be removed, potassium hydroxide for removal of acid vapours, paraffin wax 
for removal of organic solvents such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 
benzene, etc. 

EXERCISES IN RECRYSTALLISATION 

To gain experience in recrystallisation technique the student should carry out 
the following experiments. 

Choice of solvent for recrystallisation Obtain small samples (about 0.5 g) of the 
following compounds from the storeroom: (i) salicylic acid; (ii) acetanilide; (iii) 
m-dinitrobenzene; (iv) naphthalene; and (v) toluene-p-sulphonamide. Use the 
following solvents: distilled water, industrial spirit, rectified spirit, acetone, 
toluene, glacial acetic acid and hexane. 

Place 0.1 g of the substance in a semimicro test tube (75 x 10 mm or 100 x 
12 mm) and proceed systematically with the various solvents as detailed on 

* Available from J. Bibby Science Products Ltd. This apparatus is also referred to as the Abderhal- 

den vacuum drying apparatus.

p. 138. Finally, summarise your results, and indicate the most suitable solvent or 
solvents for the recrystallisation of each of the above compounds. 

Acetanilide from water. Weigh out 4.0 g of commercial acetanilide into a 250 ml 
conical flask. Add 80 ml of water and heat nearly to the boiling point on an elec- 
tric hotplate. The acetanilide will appear to melt and form an 'oil' in the solution. 
Add small portions of hot water, while stirring the mixture and boiling gently, 
until the solid has dissolved (or almost completely dissolved). If the solution is 
not colourless, allow to cool slightly, add about 0.1 g of decolourising carbon 
and continue the boiling for a few minutes in order to remove the coloured 
impurities. Filter the boiling solution through a fluted filter paper (for prepara- 
tion, see p. 139) supported in a short-necked funnel; if the solution cannot be fil- 
tered in a single operation, keep the unfiltered portion hot by returning the 
conical flask to the hotplate. Alternatively, the solution may be filtered through 
a hot- water funnel (Fig. 2.42 or 2.47(c)). Collect the filtrate in a 250 ml conical 
flask. When all the solution has been filtered, cover the flask containing the hot 
filtrate with a clock glass and cool rapidly with swirling. Allow to stand for 
about 30 minutes to complete the separation of the solid. Filter with suction 
through a small Buchner funnel (Section 2.19), wash the crystals twice with 5 ml 
portions of cold water (to remove the adhering mother-liquor) and press them in 
the funnel with a spatula or the back of a flat glass stopper. Remove the funnel 
from the filter flask, invert it on two thicknesses of filter or absorbent paper rest- 
ing upon a pad of newspaper and if necessary dislodge the pad of crystals by tap- 
ping the funnel; allow the crystals to dry in the air. It is advisable in air-drying to 
cover the crystals with a large clock glass resting upon corks, or the crystals may 
be covered with a large filter paper perforated with a number of holes in order to 
allow the solvent to evaporate. For more rapid drying, the crystals may be 
placed on a clock glass or in an evaporating basin in an oven held at a tempera- 
ture of about 80 °C. Weigh the yield of recrystallised material and determine the 
melting point. If the recrystallised product is not sufficiently pure (melting point 
low or melting over a range of several degrees), repeat the recrystallisation. Pure 
acetanilide has m.p. 114°C. 

If an m.p. determination is required soon after recrystallisation, a small 
quantity may be rapidly dried by pressing it several times upon a pad of several 
thicknesses of filter or absorbent paper and placing it upon a watch glass in a 
warm place. A piece of unglazed porous plate may also be used. 

Optional or alternative experiments are the recrystallisation of 3.0 g of crude 
benzoic or salicylic acid from water. 

Naphthalene from alcohol {crystallisation from a flammable solvent). Weigh out 
5.0 g of commercial naphthalene into a 100 ml round-bottomed flask. Add 25 ml 
of rectified spirit (or industrial spirit), 2-3 fragments of porous porcelain, and fit 
a reflux condenser (compare Fig. 2.54; a guard-tube is not required here). Heat 
the mixture on a water or steam bath or in an electric heating mantle until the 
solvent boils. Add successive small volumes (each 2-3 ml) of the solvent, and 
boil gently after each addition, until the naphthalene has dissolved (apart from 
insoluble impurities). If the solution is coloured, remove it from the heat source, 
and when it has cooled somewhat add 0.2-0.3 g of decolourising charcoal and 
mix thoroughly. Boil the mixture for several minutes. Filter the hot solution 
through a fluted filter paper or through a hot water funnel (CAUTION: All 
flames in the vicinity must be extinguished), and collect the filtrate in a conical 

152 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.21 



flask. Cover the receiver with a watch glass and cool it in cold water. Stir or 
shake the solution as cooling proceeds. After 30 minutes, filter off the crystals 
through a small Buchner funnel at the water pump; wash all the crystals into the 
funnel by rinsing the flask with some of the filtrate. Discontinue the suction and 
wash the crystals with two 5- ml portions of chilled rectified or industrial spirit. 
Continue the suction and press the crystals down firmly with a spatula or a flat 
glass stopper. Dry the crystals on filter paper as in Acetanilidefrom water, above. 
When dry, determine the weight and also the m.p. of the purified naphthalene. 
Pure naphthalene has m.p. 80 °C. 

Alternative experiments: (a) Recrystallisation of crude benzoic acid (5.0 g) 
from methanol (30 ml); the wash liquid should be 50 per cent acqueous meth- 
anol, (b) Recrystallisation of acetanilide (5g) from toluene (100ml); filter 
through a preheated funnel. 

Sulphanilk acid from water. Use 5.0 g of crude (grey) sulphanilic acid and pro- 
ceed as in Acetanilidefrom water, above. Add 0.2 g of decolourising carbon to the 
solution at 70-80 °C, and continue the boiling for several minutes. If the filtered 
solution is not colourless it must be boiled with a further 0.2 g of decolourising 
carbon. Filter the cold solution at the water pump, wash with a little cold water, 
dry and weigh the yield of recrystallised product. 



2.21 SUBLIMATION TECHNIQUES - FREEZE DRYING 

Purification of some organic compounds may frequently be achieved by the 
technique of sublimation as an alternative, or in addition, to recrystallisation. 
The success of the method depends upon the compound having a high enough 
vapour pressure at a temperature below the melting point, so that the rate of 
vaporisation from the solid will be rapid and the vapour may be condensed back 
to the solid upon a cooled surface. Impurities should have materially different 
vapour pressures to the compound undergoing purification so that they may be 
either removed with the initial sublimate or allowed to remain in the residue. 
The yield of sublimate will be greatly improved if the sublimation is carried out 
under reduced pressure, and further under these conditions the lower tempera- 
ture employed reduces the possiblity of thermal degradation. Substances having 
low vapour pressures at their melting points can only be sublimed under greatly 
diminished pressures (10~ 3 to 10" 6 mmHg). 

The theory of the sublimation process has been discussed in detail else- 
where 41 ; the following describes the practical aspects of this technique which is 
applicable down to a few milligrams of material. 

The simplest form of apparatus for the sublimation at atmospheric pressure 
of quantities of material in the region of 10 to 25 g consists of a porcelain dish 
covered with a filter paper which has been perforated with a number of small 
holes; a watch glass of the same size, convex side uppermost, is placed upon the 
filter paper. The substance is placed inside the dish, and the latter heated with a 
minute flame on a wire gauze or sand bath in a fume cupboard. The sublimate 
collects on the watch glass, and the filter paper below prevents the sublimate 
from falling into the residue. The watch glass may be kept cool by covering it 
with several pieces of damp filter paper and moistening these from time to time. 
A modification, for use with larger quantities of material, employs an inverted 

153

glass funnel with a plug of glass wool in the stem in place of the watch glass and 
supported on the porcelain dish by a narrow ring of heat resistant board fitted 
near the rim. Upon heating the dish gently the vapour of the pure compound 
passes through the holes in the filter paper and condenses on the inside walls of 
the funnel; care must be taken that the heat supply is adjusted so that the funnel 
does not become more than lukewarm. An inverted water jacket (cf. Fig. 2.42), 
filled with cold water, gives excellent results. 

For sublimation under reduced pressure (vacuum sublimation), several 
designs of apparatus are available to suit a range of differently scaled operations. 
The sublimation of quantities of materials in the region of 5 g is usually con- 
ducted in an apparatus having the basic design shown in Fig. 2.87.* The impure 
substance is placed in the bottom of the wider tube, the cold finger is inserted 
and connected to the water supply; the T-connection is attached to an oil 
vacuum pump. Evacuation of the system should be carried out slowly since the 
sudden removal of traces of moisture, solvent or air from the crystalline mass 
could cause spattering of the solid on to the cold finger, leading to contamina- 
tion of the final sublimate. The outer tube is then heated by immersion in a bath 
of liquid paraffin or silicone oil, not by a direct flame, which would be difficult to 
control and which may lead to decomposition due to too high a temperature 
being attained. The temperature should be allowed to rise slowly and held at 
that level at which sublimation is seen to occur. Usually a 'misting' of the cold 
finger - provided that the sample was completely dry - is the first indication of 
sublimation. The process should not be hurried, either by raising the tempera- 
ture too rapidly in the initial stages or by using finally too high a temperature. 
As a general guide the temperature should be in the region of 30 °C below the 
melting point of the solid or lower if sublimation takes place reasonably 
smoothly. 

With care a mixture may be fractioned by sublimation; when the amount of 
sublimate formed at a particular temperature no longer seems to increase, the 
sublimation process should be stopped and the sublimate removed. The cleaned 
cold finger is then reintroduced and the sublimation is continued at a higher

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.21 



temperature when further less volatile fractions may be obtained. The tempera- 
ture and pressure of sublimation should be recorded, together with the melting 
point of the impure substance and of the sublimate, for reference purposes. 

Another design is illustrated in Fig. 2.88 and may be purchased from appro- 
priate suppliers or made to specification; the sizes of the pot and of the cold 
finger are appropriate to the quantity of material to be sublimed, which may be 
as low as 20 mg. Frequently these assemblies, sometimes with slight modifica- 
tion, may be used for the high vacuum micro-distillation of viscous liquids (Sec- 
tion 2.28). 

For the sublimation of quantities of materials in the region of a few milli- 
grams, the vacuum sublimation block supplied by Reichert-Jung is particularly 
suitable. This block is located on the hot-stage microscope (see p. 240), the sub- 
limation chamber carefully evacuated, the temperature raised slowly, and the 
process of sublimation observed through the microscope. 

FREEZE DRYING 

This process, frequently called lyophilisation, is necessary when water is to be 
removed from solutions containing heat-labile materials so that conventional 
distillation, even under reduced pressure, would cause extensive losses by de- 
composition. Examples are to be found in the removal of water from aqueous 
solutions of enzymes, polysaccharides, peptides, etc. In principle the aqueous 
solution is frozen in a suitable solid carbon dioxide freezing mixture (see Section 
2.12), and the ice is sublimed off to leave a dry residue. 42 

Figure 2.89 illustrates a commercially available Quickfit lyophiliser (Bibby 
Science Products) accommodating a single flask of such a size that the volume of 
aqueous solution to be treated is one-quarter its total capacity. The charged 
flask is rotated in a dry ice-acetone bath so that an even layer of frozen solution 
is obtained over the inside. The flask is immediately attached to the refrigerant 
chambers which are filled with a Cardice-acetone mixture. An oil vacuum pump 
is connected to the refrigerant chamber via the supplementary trap, which if pos- 
sible should be immersed in a Dewar flask filled with liquid nitrogen; such a 
cooled trap provides maximum protection for the vacuum pump. Vacuum is

applied to the apparatus and sublimation of ice takes place over a period of 
several hours (best carried out overnight). Air should be readmitted to the 
apparatus very slowly as the dried material is frequently a light 'fluffy' powder 
and is liable to become dispersed. The flask is removed and the ice allowed to 
melt and drain off through the stopcock. 

Other designs of apparatus, which are variations on this pattern, are avail- 
able for freeze-drying smaller quantities of solution using test tubes having 
ground glass joints or round-bottomed flasks of up to 50 ml capacity. 

2.22 SOLVENT EXTRACTION 

As was pointed out in Section 2.18, the crude products of most organic reactions 
are multicomponent mixtures, and a convenient initial isolation procedure, for 
the first stages of both the separation of such mixtures and of the purification of 
the components, may involve solvent extraction processes. The general cases 
which are discussed below to illustrate the technique of solvent extraction are 
selected to cover many of the commonly met systems. The student is recom- 
mended to refer to the comments in Section 2.18 on the necessity of assessing the 
chemical and physical nature of the components of a particular reaction mixture 
with regard to their solubilities in solvents, and to their acidic, basic or neutral 
characteristics. 

EXTRACTION OF LIQUIDS 

Batch-extraction processes. Perhaps one of the most frequent cases that is 
encountered is the separation of a neutral organic compound (or compounds) 
from a solution or suspension (as either a solid or liquid) in an aqueous medium, 
by shaking with an organic solvent in which the compound is soluble and which 
is immiscible (or nearly immiscible) with water. 

The solvents generally employed for extraction are diethyl ether or di- 
isopropyl ether, toluene, dichloromethane and light petroleum. The solvent 
selected will depend upon the solubility of the substance to be extracted in that 
solvent and upon the ease with which the solvent can be separated from the 
solute. Diethyl ether, owing to its powerful solvent properties and its low boiling 
point (35 °C) thus rendering its removal extremely facile, is very widely used; its 
chief disadvantage lies in the great fire hazard attending its use, but this may be 
reduced to a minimum by adopting the general precautions given in Section 
2.3.2, p. 39. The fire hazard is reduced also by employing di-isopropyl ether 
(b.p. 67.5 °C), but this solvent is much more expensive than diethyl ether. 

If prior information is not available, solvent selection should be based on 
some small-scale trials. A few millimetres of suspension or solution to be 
extracted are placed in a small test tube and shaken with an equal volume of 
diethyl ether, when dissolution of suspended material clearly indicates that the 
solvent would be satisfactory. If the solution to be extracted is homogeneous 
initially, then the ether solution is removed with a dropper pipette on to a watch 
glass, and the ether is allowed to evaporate to determine whether material has 
been extracted. A little experience soon enables the student to differentiate 
between organic liquids so extracted and traces of water simultaneously 
removed during the extraction process. If extraction with diethyl ether proves 
unsatisfactory the experiment is repeated with a fresh sample of reaction mixture 

156 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.22 



using dichloromethane (b.p. 40 °C) as the extraction solvent. If necessary, the 
other solvents are tried similarly until a suitable solvent has been selected. 

By way of illustration, the technique of the bulk batch-extraction of an 
aqueous solution with diethyl ether* is as follows. A separatory funnel (conical 
or pear-shaped which short stem and fitted with a ground glass interchangeable 
stopper) is selected of about twice the volume as that to be extracted and 
mounted in a ring on a stand with a firm base. The barrel and plug of the stop- 
cock are dried with a linen cloth and in the case of glass stopcocks lightly treated 
with a suitable lubricant (Apiezon or silicon grease). The solution and the 
extraction solvent (usually about one-third of the volume of the solution, but see 
theory of extraction, below) are introduced into the funnel, and the latter stop- 
pered. All naked flames in the immediate vicinity should be extinguished. The 
funnel with the stopper firmly held in place is then shaken gently (so that the 
excess vapour pressuref will be developed slowly), inverted and the stopcock 
opened in order to relieve the excess pressure. The stopcock is again closed, the 
funnel again shaken and the internal pressure released. When the atmosphere in- 
side the funnel is saturated with ether vapour, further shaking develops little or 
no additional pressure. At this stage, the funnel is vigorously shaken for 2-3 
minutes to ensure the maximum possible transfer of the organic substance to the 
ether layer, and then returned to the stand in order to allow the mixture to settle. 
When two sharply defined layers have formed, the lower aqueous layer is run off 
and separated as completely as possible. The residual ethereal layer is then 
poured out through the upper neck of the funnel; contamination with any drops 
of the aqueous solution still remaining in the stem of the funnel is thus avoided. 
The aqueous solution may now be returned to the funnel and the extraction re- 
peated, using fresh ether on each occasion until the extraction is complete. Not 
more than three extractions are usually required, but the exact number of 
extractions will naturally depend upon the partition coefficient of the substance 
between water and ether. The completeness of the extraction can always be 
determined by evaporating a portion of the last extract on the water bath and 
noting the amount of residue. The combined ethereal solutions are dried with an 
appropriate reagent (Section 2.23), and the ether removed on a water bath 
(Sections 2.24 and 2.27). The residual organic material is now further purified, 
depending upon its properties and the organic impurities removed in the extrac- 
tion, by chromatography, by recrystallisation or by distillation. It is also import- 
ant to retain the aqueous solution until the final purified product is isolated so 
that incorrect observations on the solubility characteristics of the required prod- 
uct do not lead to premature discarding of the product. 

Occasionally emulsions are formed in the extraction of aqueous solution by 
organic solvents, thus rendering a clean separation impossible. Emulsion forma- 
tion is particularly liable to occur when the aqueous solution is alkaline, and 
when dichloromethane is the extracting solvent. The emulsion may be broken 
by any of the following devices, but in general its occurrence may be minimised 

* The diethyl ether (frequently abbreviated to ether) should be reasonably free from 'peroxides', see 
Section 4. 1.7 J, p. 404. 

t When ether is poured into a funnel containing an aqueous solution, a two-liquid phase system is 
formed. If the funnel is stoppered and the mixture shaken the vapour pressure of the ether (300- 
500 mm according to the temperature) is ultimately added to the pressure of the air (about 760 mm) 
plus water vapour, thus producing excess of pressure inside the funnel. Hence the necessity for 
shaking gently and releasing the pressure from time to time until the air has been expelled. 



157 



2.22 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



by using a very careful swirling action in the shaking of the separatory funnel 
during the initial extraction; only in the final extraction is a more vigorous 
action adopted. 

1. Mechanical means, such as agitating the end of a glass rod at the interface of 
the emulsion with the growing liquid phase, or alternatively gentle rocking of 
the funnel or gentle swirling, may be successful. Slow nitration through a 
compacted pad of glass wool in a Hirsch or Buchner funnel is often satisfac- 
tory. The emulsion may be transferred to a conical flask and the flask placed 
in an ultrasonic cleaning bath. 

2. An increase in concentration of ionic species may be helpful as the result of the 

addition of sodium chloride, sodium sulphate or potassium carbonate, for 
example. With extractions involving alkaline solutions the addition of dilute 
sulphuric acid may be helpful, providing that complete neutralisation or 
acidification does not take place since this may result in a change in the chem- 
ical nature of some of the components (see below). 

3. Emulsions may sometimes be broken by the addition of a few drops of alcohol 

or other suitable solvent from a dropper pipette, the outlet of which is sited at 
the emulsion-liquid interface. 

4. A satisfactory separation is frequently obtained if the mixture is simply 
allowed to stand for some time. 

In the isolation of organic compounds from aqueous solutions, use is fre- 
quently made of the fact that the solubility of many organic substances in water 
is considerably decreased by the presence of dissolved inorganic salts (sodium 
chloride, calcium chloride, ammonium sulphate, etc.). This is the so-called 
salting-out effect. A further advantage is that the solubility of partially miscible 
organic solvents, such as ether, is considerably less in the salt solution, thus 
reducing the loss of solvent in extractions. 

The process of extraction is concerned with the distribution law or partition 
law which states that if to a system of two liquid layers, made up of two im- 
miscible or slightly miscible components, is added a quantity of a third sub- 
stance soluble in both layers, then the substance distributes itself between the 
two layers so that the ratio of the concentration in one solvent to the concentra- 
tion in the second solvent remains constant at constant temperature. It is 
assumed that the molecular state of the substance is the same in both solvents.* 
If c A and c B are concentrations in the layers A and B, then, at constant temperat- 
ure: 

Ca/cb = constant = K 

The constant K is termed the distribution or partition coefficient. As a very rough 
approximation the distribution coefficient may be assumed equal to the ratio of 
the solubilities in the two solvents. Organic compounds are usually relatively 
more soluble in organic solvents than in water, hence they may be extracted 
from aqueous solutions. If electrolytes, e.g. sodium chloride, are added to the 
aqueous solution, the solubility of the organic substance is lowered, i.e. it will be 
salted out: this will assist the extraction of the organic compound. 

The problem that arises in extraction is the following. Given a limited quant -

ity of the solvent, should this be used in one operation or divided into several 
portions for repeated extractions in order to secure the best result? A general 
solution may be derived as follows. Let the volume v ml of the aqueous solution 
containing w grams of the dissolved substance be repeatedly extracted with 
fresh portions of s ml of the organic solvent, which is immiscible with water. If w, 
grams is the weight of the solute remaining in the aqueous phase after the first 
extraction, then the concentrations are w t /v g per ml in the aqueous phase and 
(w — w,)/s g per ml in the organic solvent layer. The partition coefficient K is

Kv + s 



We desire to make w„ as small as possible for a given weight of solvent, i.e. the 
product of n and s is constant, hence n should be large and s small; in other 
words, the best results are obtained by dividing the extraction solvent into 
several portions rather than by making a single extraction with the whole quant- 
ity. It must be emphasised that the expression deduced above applies strictly to a 
solvent which may be regarded as completely immisicible with water, such as 
toluene, dichloromethane or carbon tetrachloride; if the solvent is slightly mis- 
cible, e.g. ether, the equation (i) is only approximate, but is nevertheless useful 
for indicating the qualitative nature of the results to be expected. 

Let us consider a specific example, viz. the extraction of a solution of 4.0 g of 
butanoic acid in 100ml of water at 15 °C with 100ml of benzene at 15 °C. The 
partition coefficient of the acid between benzene and water may be taken as 3 (or 
j between water and benzene) at 15 °C. For a single extraction with benzene, we 
have:

For three extractions with 33.3 ml portions of fresh benzene: 
£ x 100 ^ 3 



w„ = 4 



100 



+ 33.3 



0.5 g 



Hence one extraction with 100 ml of benzene removes 3.0 g (or 75%) of the 
butanoic acid, while three extractions remove 3.5 g (or 87%) of the total acid. 
This clearly shows the greater efficiency of extraction obtainable with several 
extractions when the total volume of solvent is the same. Moreover, the smaller 
the distribution coefficient between the organic solvent and the water, the larger 
the number of extractions that will be necessary. 

The above considerations apply also to the removal of a soluble impurity by 
extraction (or washing) with an immiscible solvent. Several washings with por- 
tions of the solvent give better results than a single washing with the same total 
volume of the solvent. 

Continuous extractions of liquids. When the organic compounds is more soluble 
in water than in the organic solvent (i.e. the distribution coefficient between the 
organic solvent and water is small), very large quantities of organic solvent must 
be employed to obtain even a moderately efficient extraction. This may be 
avoided by the use of an apparatus for continuous extraction where only rela- 
tively small volumes of solvent are required. 

Two types of apparatus are available according to whether the aqueous solu- 
tion is to be extracted with an organic solvent which is heavier or lighter than 
water. The precise design varies according to the manufacturer (e.g. Bibby 
Science Products; Aldrich, etc.); the following description and diagrams may be 
regarded as typical.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.22 



Figures 2.90, 2.91 and 2.92 illustrate the apparatus employed for the extrac- 
tion of an aqueous solution by solvents lighter than water, such as ether or ben- 
zene (liquid-liquid extraction by upward displacement). That shown in Fig. 2.90 is 
suitable for small amounts of aqueous solution (6-8 ml); the solvent distils from 
a flask (attached to the lower end) and condenses in a reflux condenser (attached 
to the upper end), passes through the funnel down a narrow tube partially open 
at the lower end into the aqueous solution held in a glass thimble, then rises to 
the surface and returns to the flask via the small hole at the thimble top, having 
during its passage extracted some portion of the dissolved material from it. The 
apparatus shown in Fig. 2.91 is useful for volumes of aqueous solution in the 
range 10 to 500 ml; its mode of operation is similar to the previous case, but this 
apparatus has additionally baffle discs to assist the even distribution of rising 
solvent droplets and hence increase the efficiency of the extraction. The liquid- 
liquid extraction apparatus shown in Fig. 2.92 is available in capacities up to 
2.5 litres. This design incorporates a sintered glass disc at the end of the con- 
densed solvent delivery tube, which serves the purpose of dispersing the solvent 
into small droplets. It is important that solvent is poured continuously down the 
delivery tube to escape through the sinter while the disc is lowered through the 
aqueous solution during assembly. 

In the use of all these extractors, it should be borne in mind that the extrac- 
tion process takes place over several hours and due precautions should be taken 
as the apparatus will be unattended (see Section 2.16). Furthermore as the 
extraction solvent is more than likely to be flammable, due attention to fire 
hazards should be taken. The flasks of solvent should be heated with a heating 
mantle and the level of the solvent in the flask should be above the ring of con- 
tact between the mantle element and the outer glass surface, otherwise there is 
danger of prolonged and possibly harmful overheating of material left as a ring 
above the solvent level. A further point to note with the use of all these types of 
apparatus is that the level of aqueous solution should be substantially below the 
thimble holes, or the extractor side-arms, even when the baffle discs, etc, are in 
position. This is necessary since the volumes of aqueous solution may increase, 
either owing to the small solubility in water of the extracting solvent (and this is 
particularly noticeable with diethyl ether) or to a small rise in the temperature of 
the aqueous solution during extraction leading to expansion; this could lead to 
some of the aqueous solution being carried over into the solvent flask. 

Figures 2.93, 2.94 and 2.95 illustrate apparatus employed for the extraction of 
aqueous solutions by solvent heavier than water such as dichloromethane or 
carbon tetrachloride (liquid-liquid extraction by downward displacement). 

That shown in Fig. 2.93, when fitted with flask and condenser, is suitable for 
extractions of about 10 ml of solution. The condensed solvent drops through the 
funnel and thence down through the solution and escapes via the side-arm 
sealed into the bottom of the extractor thimble. When assembling the apparatus 
it is advisable to pour a few millimetres of the extracting solvent into the thimble 
before pouring in the liquid to be extracted; in this way contamination of the sol- 
vent in the flask by a carry-over of solution to be extracted is minimised. The 
apparatus shown in Fig. 2.94, when fitted with a flask and condenser, is suitable 
for the extraction of about 50 ml of aqueous solution; the baffle discs improve 
the dispersion of solvent into droplets. Some of the solvent should be placed in 
the extraction vessel first, then the baffle plates and finally the aqueous solution; 
further addition of solvent to prevent the passage of aqueous solution down the

a,

Fig. 2.95 



solvent return tube may be necessary. The apparatus shown in Fig. 2.95 is suit- 
able for the extraction of up to 1 litre of aqueous solution. Here the solvent 
vapours pass through the holes at the top of the solvent delivery tube to con- 
dense in the reflux condenser, and pass through the delivery tube and thence 
through the sintered disc which should be located just under the surface of the 
solution to be extracted. The fine droplets collect at the base of the extractor 
which should have been previously loaded with sufficient solvent so that with 
the weight of aqueous solution, the solvent level in the side-arm coincides with 
the horizontal portion of the solvent return tube. 

Extraction by chemically active solvents. Not infrequently the crude organic 
product from a reaction may contain a mixture of acidic (phenols and carboxy- 
lic acids), basic and neutral components in various combinations. Some of these 
components may of course be impurities, but none the less, whether as a pre- 
liminary purification stage or as a means of separating the mixture, a carefully 
planned solvent extraction procedure may be adopted using acidic and basic 
reagents which react chemically with the basic and acidic components of the 
mixture respectively. The following full account of a typical procedure may be 
abbreviated in practice according to the complexity of the mixture to be 
handled. 

The multicomponent organic mixture is dissolved in a suitable solvent; this 
should be diethyl ether if at all possible for the reasons stated above, but any low 
boiling, water-immiscible solvent (light petroleum, dichloromethane, etc.) may 
be used. This solution is now shaken in a separatory funnel (see above) with 
several successive portions of dilute hydrochloric acid (1m) or dilute sulphuric 
acid (1m; (1)). Basic components are thus extracted into the aqueous acidic 



162 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.22 



extract, and the combined extracts are washed once with the clean organic sol- 
vent to remove traces of the original organic phase which may have been carried 
over into the aqueous extract (this is called a 'back -extraction' process, (2)). The 
basic components are recovered (unless they only represent known impurities 
which are not required), by cooling the aqueous extract in an ice bath, basifying 
it carefully by adding an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (5m; see (3)) 
dropwise and with stirring, extracting the precipitated oil or solid with organic 
solvent, and drying (Section 2.23) and evaporating (Section 2.27) the extract. 
The original organic solution from which the basic components have been 
removed is now extracted with several successive portions of dilute aqueous 
sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate solution (1m). Acidic components will 
be extracted into the aqueous alkaline layer. After 'back-extraction' with fresh 
organic solvent, the acidic components may be recovered (if necessary) by cool- 
ing the alkaline extract, acidifying by the careful dropwise addition of hydro- 
chloric acid (5m; (4)), extracting the precipitated solid or liquid with an organic 
solvent, and drying and evaporating the extract (5). The original organic solu- 
tion now only contains neutral components; these may be recovered by washing 
the solution first with a little dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid to remove traces 
of alkali, then with distilled water until the washings are neutral. The organic 
solution is finally dried and the solvent is evaporated. 

Notes. (1) The volumes of organic and aqueous solvents to be used depend, of course, on 
the quantities of material to be handled. As a guide, a 5 g mixture may be dissolved in 
30 ml of organic solvent and extracted with three successive portions of 10 ml of aqueous 
acid. The student should always check the completeness of the extraction by removing a 
little of the final extract into a test tube and adding a little concentrated sodium hydrox- 
ide solution to make the solution alkaline; a cloudiness suggests that further extractions 
of the original solution with aqueous acid are necessary. Because of the conversion of the 
base component into its water-soluble salt, almost complete removal of the base from the 
mixture is achieved in relatively few extractions. 

(2) The solvent washings are best returned to the original solvent solution which in any 
case may require 'topping-up' in a prolonged extraction process. 

(3) The reason for using a concentrated solution of alkali is to keep the final total volume 
of aqueous solution to a minimum to facilitate the subsequent recovery of the basic com- 
ponents. If no precipitate is visible but the aroma of an amine is noticeable, this implies 
some degree of water solubility; recovery is then best attempted using one of the continu- 
ous extraction techniques. 

(4) If aqueous sodium carbonate has been used then considerable effervescence will 
accompany this acidification process. It is advisable that a flask which is large compared 
to the volume of solution to be treated should be employed and that the solution be 
shaken vigorously during the addition of acid. 

(5) Extraction of the original solution with sodium hydroxide will have removed phenols, 
enols and carboxylic acids. Separation of these may be readily accomplished by redissolv- 
ing the acidic components in diethyl ether (or other suitable solvent). Extraction with 
saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate will remove the carboxylic acids, 
enabling the phenolic (or enolic) components to be recovered by evaporating the dried 
organic phase. Acidification of the aqueous extract will liberate the carboxylic acid com- 
ponents which may then be isolated by extraction in the usual way. 

While the above details provide a general procedure for handling mixtures of 
acidic, basic and neutral components, other selective extraction reagents may be 
utilised in certain special instances. For example, cold concentrated sulphuric 
acid will remove unsaturated hydrocarbons (alkenes and alkynes) present in 

163 



2.22 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



saturated hydrocarbons, or alcohols and ethers present in alkyl halides. In the 
former case soluble sulphonated products are formed while in the latter case 
alkyl hydrogen sulphates or addition complexes that are soluble in the concen- 
trated acid are produced. Another example is provided by the removal of con- 
taminating benzaldehyde from the benzyl alcohol obtained by the Cannizzaro 
reaction (Expt 6.133). 

EXTRACTION OF SOLIDS 

The process is generally applied to the removal of natural products from dried 
tissue originating from plants, fungi, seaweed, mammals, etc. The steam-volatile 
natural products (e.g. those occurring in the essential oils) such as the alcohols, 
esters and carbonyl compounds of the aliphatic (both acyclic and alicyclic) and 
the simpler aromatic systems, are removed by steam distillation (Section 2.25). 
The non-steam-volatile compounds may be removed by solvent extraction using 
a batch or continuous process. Not infrequently a comprehensive study of the 
range of organic substances in a particular tissue requires extraction with a suc- 
cession of solvents starting with light petroleum (b.p. « 40 °C) for the removal 
of the least polar components (e.g. higher homologues of terpenes, steroids, etc.), 
progressing through to more polar solvents such as diethyl ether, acetone, 
ethanol and finally water for the sequential removal of the more polar com- 
pounds (e.g. amino acids, carbohydrates, etc.). 

The batch process, which tends to be less efficient than the continuous extrac- 
tion process, involves macerating the tissue with the appropriate solvent in a 
Waring Blender, soaking for a short time (1), filtering in a suitable size of 
Buchner funnel and then returning the residue to fresh solvent for further extrac- 
tion. The combined solvent extracts are then evaporated, usually under reduced 
pressure and the residue submitted to appropriate fractionation procedures (2). 

Notes. (1) Warming the suspended solid in the solvent may be necessary by removing the 
'porridge' to a suitable flask and heating under reflux. Care must be taken if such is the 
case to supervise this operation carefully as there may be considerable tendency towards 
'bumping'. It should also be borne in mind that this batch-extraction process uses open- 
type vessels and usually large volumes of solvents; precautions must therefore be taken in 
relation to the possible fire and toxic hazards involved in the use of a particular solvent. 
(2) As a first step, this procedure would involve solvent extraction procedures to divide 
the multicomponent mixture into acidic, basic and neutral fractions (see above). Sub- 
sequently chromatography, fractional crystallisation, etc., would be employed as appro- 
priate. 

For the continuous extraction of a solid by a hot solvent, it is better to use a 
Soxhlet extraction apparatus such as that shown in Fig. 2.96. The solid sub- 
stance is placed in the porous thimble A (made of tough filter paper) and the 
latter is placed in the inner tube of the Soxhlet apparatus. The apparatus is then 
fitted to a round-bottomed flask C of appropriate size containing the solvent 
and boiling chips, and to a reflux condenser D (preferably of the double surface 
type). The solvent is boiled gently; the vapour passes up through the tube E, is 
condensed by the condenser D, and the condensed solvent falls into the thimble 
A and slowly fills the body of the Soxhlet.* When the solvent reaches the top of 



* For solids of low density, the top of the porous thimble A should be above the siphon tube F, 
otherwise the solid may tend to float out of the thimble and pass down the siphon tube; a plug of 
glass wool may also be placed within the top of the thimble. 

164

Fig. 2.97 



the tube F, it siphons over into the flask C, and thus removes that portion of the 
substance which it has extracted in A. The process is repeated automatically 
until complete extraction is effected. The extracted compound may be isolated 
from its solution in C by any of the usual methods. One minor disadvantage of 
this apparatus is that the temperature of the liquid in A differs considerably from 
the boiling point of the solvent; extraction is thus effected by the lukewarm 
liquid and is therefore relatively slow, particularly if the solubility of the sub- 
stance increases markedly with temperature. This disadvantage is absent in the 
modifications illustrated in Fig. 2.97 in which the part of the apparatus housing 
the extraction thimble is surrounded by the vapour of the solvent: extraction is 
accordingly effected by the hot solvent. The capacity of the Soxhlet extractor is 
quoted in terms of the siphoning volume; sizes ranging from 6 ml to 5 litre are 
available. 

2.23 DRYING OF LIQUIDS OR OF SOLUTIONS OF ORGANIC 
COMPOUNDS IN ORGANIC SOLVENTS 

Organic liquids, or solutions of organic substances in organic solvents such as 
would be obtained from solvent extraction procedures described in Section 2.22, 
are usually dried by direct contact with a solid drying agent. The selection of the 
desiccant will be governed by the following considerations: (i) it must not com- 
bine chemically with the organic compound; (ii) it should have a rapid action 
and an effective drying capacity; (iii) it should not dissolve appreciably in the 
liquid; (iv) it should be as economical as possible; and (v) it should have no cata- 
lytic effect in promoting chemical reactions of the organic compound, such as 
polymerisation, condensation reactions and auto-oxidation. The various 
common drying agents are discussed in detail below; the drying of solvents, 
including the use of molecular sieves, together with other special techniques of 
solvent purification is discussed in Section 4.1. 



165 



2.23 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



It is generally best to shake the liquid with small amounts of the drying agent 
until no further action appears to take place; too large an excess is to be avoided 
in order to keep adsorption losses down to a minimum. If sufficient water is 
present to cause the separation of a small aqueous phase (e.g. with calcium 
chloride), this must be removed* and the liquid treated with a fresh portion of 
the desiccant. If time permits, the liquid, when apparently dry, should be filtered 
and left overnight in contact with fresh drying agent. The desiccant should, in 
general, be separated by nitration (best through a fluted filter paper) before the 
distillation of the liquid. This is particularly necessary with many reagents 
whose drying action depends upon the formation of hydrates (e.g. sodium sul- 
phate, magnesium sulphate and calcium chloride): at higher temperatures the 
vapour pressures above the salts become appreciable and unless the salts are 
removed, much, if not all, of the water may be returned to the distillate. How- 
ever, with some desiccating agents (e.g. calcium oxide, phosphoric oxide), the 
reaction products with water are quite stable and filtration is not essential. 

A list of the common drying agents with their practical limitations and their 
important applications follows. 

ANHYDROUS CALCIUM CHLORIDE 

This reagent is widely employed because of its high drying capacity and its 
cheapness. It has a high water-absorption capacity (since it forms CaCl 2 .6H 2 
below 30 °C) but is not very rapid in its action; ample time must therefore be 
given for desiccation. The slowness of the action is attributed to the blanketing 
of the particles of calcium chloride with a thin layer of the solution formed by 
the extraction of the water present; on standing, the water combines forming a 
solid lower hydrate, which is also a desiccating agent. 

The industrial process for preparing the reagent usually permits a little 
hydrolysis to occur, and the product may contain some free calcium hydroxide 
or basic chloride. It cannot therefore be employed for drying acids or acidic 
liquids. Calcium chloride combines with alcohols, phenols, amines, amino acids, 
amides, ketones and some aldehydes and esters, and thus cannot be used with 
these classes of compounds. 

MAGNESIUM SULPHATE 

The most effective commercially available form of this desiccant is the mono- 
hydrate; a cheaper grade contains from 30 to 40 per cent of water but this retains 
useful desiccating action (the fully hydrated form is the heptahydrate). It is an 
excellent neutral desiccant, rapid in its action, chemically inert and fairly effi- 
cient, and can be employed for most compounds including those (e.g. esters, 
aldehydes, ketones, nitriles, amides) to which calcium chloride is not applicable. 

ANHYDROUS SODIUM SULPHATE 

This is a neutral drying agent, is inexpensive, and has a high water-absorption 
capacity (forming Na 2 SO 4 .10H 2 O, below 32.4 °C). It can be used on almost all 
occasions, but the drying action is slow and not thorough. The desiccant is valu- 
able for the preliminary removal of large quantities of water. Sodium sulphate is 

* The aqueous phase may be removed rapidly and conveniently by filtration through a Whatman 
Phase Separating Paper and washing with a small quantity of the dry solvent. The water-repellent 
paper retains the aqueous layer. 

166 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.23 



an inefficient drying agent for solvents such as benzene and toluene and is use- 
less as a desiccant above 32.4 °C, at which temperature the decahydrate begins 
to lose water of crystallisation. 

ANHYDROUS CALCIUM SULPHATE 

When the dihydrate CaS0 4 .2H 2 or the hemihydrate 2CaS0 4 .H 2 is heated in 
an oven at 230-240 °C for about three hours, anhydrous calcium sulphate is 
obtained. It is sold commercially under the name of "Drierite 1 (not to be confused 
with l Dehydrite\ which is anhydrous magnesium perchlorate). The reagent is ex- 
tremely rapid and efficient in its action, is chemically inert, and is insoluble in 
organic solvents; it may therefore be used with most organic compounds. The 
only disadvantage is its limited capacity for absorption of water since it passes 
into the hemihydrate 2CaS0 4 .H 2 0, and should theoretically absorb only 6.6 
per cent of its weight of water to retain its maximum efficiency; where extreme 
desiccation is not essential, the porous commercial product may absorb up to 
about 10 per cent of its weight of water. It is recommended that the solution or 
liquid be subjected to a preliminary drying with magnesium or sodium sulphate, 
before using anhydrous calcium sulphate. 

ANHYDROUS POTASSIUM CARBONATE 

This drying agent possesses a moderate efficiency and drying capacity (the 
dihydrate is formed). It is applied to the drying of nitriles, ketones, esters and 
some alcohols, but cannot be employed for acids, phenols and other acidic sub- 
stances. It also sometimes replaces sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide 
for amines, when a strongly alkaline reagent is to be avoided. Potassium carbon- 
ate frequently finds application in the salting-out of water-soluble alcohols, 
amines and ketones, and as a preliminary drying agent. In many cases it may be 
replaced by the desiccant magnesium sulphate. 

SODIUM AND POTASSIUM HYDROXIDES 

The use of these efficient reagents should usually be confined to the drying of 
amines (soda lime, barium oxide or calcium oxide may also be employed), 
potassium hydroxide is somewhat superior to the sodium compound. These 
bases react with many organic compounds (e.g. acids, phenols, esters and 
amides) in the presence of water, and with some common solvents (e.g. chloro- 
form) so that their use as desiccants is very limited. 

CALCIUM OXIDE 

This reagent is commonly used for the drying of alcohols of low molecular 
weight; its action is improved by preheating to 700-900 °C in an electric furnace. 
Both calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide are insoluble in the solvents, stable 
to heat, and practically non-volatile, hence the reagent need not be removed 
before distillation.* Owing to its high alkalinity, it cannot be used for acidic 
compounds or for esters; the latter would undergo hydrolysis. 

* Some finely divided particles of solid may be carried over during the distillation from calcium 
oxide. It is recommended that the head of the ground glass distillation assembly leading to the con- 
denser be filled with purified glass wool in order to retain the finely-divided solid. The purified glass 
wool is prepared by boiling commerical glass wool with concentrated nitric acid for about 15 
minutes, washing thoroughly with distilled water, and drying at 120 °C. Alternatively it may be more 
convenient to use a splash head (Fig. 2.102). 

167 



2.23 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



PHOSPHORIC OXIDE 

This is an extremely efficient reagent and is rapid in its action. Phosphoric oxide 
is difficult to handle, channels badly, is expensive and tends to form a protective 
syrupy coating on its surface. A preliminary drying with anhydrous magnesium 
sulphate, etc., should precede its use. Phosphoric oxide is only employed when 
extreme desiccation is required. It may be used for hydrocarbons, ethers, alkyl 
and aryl halides and nitriles, but not for alcohols, acids, amines and ketones.

DRYING BY DISTILLATION 

In most cases the distillation of organic preparations before drying is regarded 
as bad technique, but in a number of instances of solvents or liquids, which are 
practically insoluble in water, the process of distillation itself effects the drying. 
In short, advantage is taken of the formation of binary and ternary mixtures of 
minimum boiling point. Thus if moist benzene is distilled, the first fraction con- 
sists of a mixture of benzene and water (the constant boiling point mixture, b.p. 
69 °C, contains 9 per cent of water); after the water has been removed, dry ben- 
zene distils. Other solvents which may be dried in this manner include carbon 
tetrachloride, toluene, xylene, hexane, heptane, light petroleum, 1,4-dioxane and 
ethylene dichloride. The dry solvent should not be collected until after about 10 
per cent of the main bulk has passed over, since it is necessary to eliminate also 
the moisture absorbed by the walls of the flask and the condenser. If moist ani- 
line (b.p. 184°C) or moist nitrobenzene (b.p. 210 °C) is distilled, the moisture is 
rapidly removed in the first portion of the distillate and the remainder of the 
liquid passes over dry. Sometimes a moist liquid preparation, which is sparingly 
soluble in water, is dried by admixture with a solvent (formerly benzenef now 

t Benzene should be replaced by the much less toxic toluene if at all possible; this forms a binary 
azeotrope with water, b.p. 85 °C, containing 20 per cent of water. 

168 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.24 



usually toluene) immiscible with water, and the resulting mixture is distilled. 
Thus when a mixture of pentanoic acid, water and benzene is distilled, the mix- 
ture of benzene and water passes over first (b.p. 69.3 °C), this is followed by dry 
benzene (b.p. 80 °C), and finally by dry pentanoic acid (b.p. 186 °C). This 
method has been used for the drying of commercial preparations of 3-methyl- 
butanoic acid and higher aliphatic carboxylic acids by distillation with about 40 
per cent of the weight of benzene until the temperature of the vapours reaches 
100 °C. The dehydration of crystallised oxalic acid by distillation with carbon 
tetrachloride is sometimes regarded as another example of the use of a binary 
mixture for the removal of water (see also pinacol from pinacol hydrate, Expt 
5.35). 

The following is an example of the use of a ternary mixture in the drying of a 
solid. D-Fructose (laevulose) is dissolved in warm absolute ethanol, benzene is 
added, and the mixture is fractionated. A ternary mixture, alcohol-benzene- 
water, b.p. 64 °C, distils first, and then the binary mixture, benzene-alcohol, b.p. 
68.3 °C. The residual, dry alcoholic solution is partially distilled and the concen- 
trated solution is allowed to crystallise: the anhydrous sugar separates. 

2.24 DISTILLATION AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE 43 

A typical assembly for the purification of liquids by simple distillation at atmo- 
sphere pressure is shown in Fig. 2.98. The flask may be of any appropriate size, 
although small quantities of liquid (between 5 and 25 ml) are best distilled in 
pear-shaped flasks; the flask when charged with liquid should be one-half to 
two-thirds full. The screw-cap adapter on the still-head allows the bulb of the 
thermometer to be located slightly below the level of the side tube. If the boiling 
point of the liquid is likely to be above 150°C the water-cooled condenser 
shown is replaced by an unjacketed tube fitted with ground glass joints at each 
end to act as an air-cooled condenser. A drying tube attached to the side-arm 
adapter may be filled with anhydrous calcium chloride held in position by loose 
plugs of cotton wool if it is desired to protect the distillate from moisture in the 




Fig. 2.98 

169 



2.24 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



atmosphere. If the liquid is flammable the side-arm should be fitted with a piece 
of rubber tubing, the outlet of which leads to an open window, fume cupboard 
or drain. When the distillation flask has been charged with liquid, a few frag- 
ments of unglazed porous porcelain (porous pot) to promote regular ebullition 
in the subsequent heating are added; they should never be added to the hot 
liquid.* The flask may be heated on a ceramic-centred wire gauze or preferably 
in a bath (Section 2.13) appropriate to the boiling point of the liquid undergoing 
distillation. For small quantities of liquid contained in pear-shaped flasks care- 
ful heating with a semi-luminous Bunsen flame may be used. Heating may be 
rather rapid until boiling commences; the rate of heating must then be reduced 
and the source of heat adjusted so that the distillate is collected at the rate of one 
or two drops per second. It must be borne in mind that at the commencement of 
the distillation it takes an appreciable time for the vapour to heat the upper part 
of the flask and the thermometer. The distillation should not be conducted too 
slowly, for the thermometer may momentarily cool from lack of a constant 
supply of fresh vapour on the bulb, and an irregular thermometer reading will 
result. 

It will be found that the temperature will first rise rapidly until it is near the 
boiling point of the liquid, then slowly, and finally will remain practically con- 
stant. At this point a clean, weighed receiver should be connected to the appar- 
atus and the distillate collected until only a small volume of liquid remains in the 
flask; the temperature should be noted at regular intervals. If the liquid being 
distilled is not grossly impure most of it will pass over within a narrow tempera- 
ture range (within 2-3 degrees). 

Should the temperature rise steadily, instead of remaining virtually constant, 
it is then clear that this simple distillation procedure is unsuitable for the purifi- 
cation of the sample and some form of fractional distillation (Section 2.26) will 
have to be used. 

For the distillation of quantities of liquid in the range 0.5 to 5 ml several 
designs of apparatus are suitable. The pear-shaped flask with fixed side-arm 
condenser (Fig. 2.99) having capacities of 2 ml or 5 ml (joint size 7/11) is still 
available in many research laboratories, and in any case may be easily con- 
structed by a competent glass blower. This design has the advantage of minimis- 
ing losses due to retention of the distillate as a film on the glass surface. The side- 
arm has a tip on the drip end to facilitate drainage and collection of distillate. A 
design is also available (Aldrich) for quick micro-distillation in which the liquid 
condensing on a cold finger collects in a small cup (Fig. 2.100); a thermometer 
may be inserted in the side joint, although it is essential that liquid condensing 
on the mercury bulb drips into the collecting cup. The apparatus is equally 
effective under atmospheric or reduced pressure. Controlled heating is best 
achieved with both apparatus designs by means of a suitably-sized air bath or an 
oil bath. Finally the Kugelrohr bulb-to-bulb distillation unit (Aldrich) (see 
Section 2.28) may be operated at atmospheric pressure. 

The assembly shown in Fig. 2.101 is useful for distilling off solvent from solu- 
tions, as would be obtained for example from solvent extraction procedures. The 

* Other aids to regular boiling include the addition of the following: fragments of pumice stone or of 
carborundum; small strips of Teflon tape 19 mm wide or of shredded Teflon (these may be washed 
with an organic solvent, dried and reused); small pieces of platinum wire (use is made of the well- 
known property of platinum in absorbing large quantities of gases).

solution is placed in the separatory funnel and is allowed to drop into the flask, 
initially about half-full with the solution, at approximately the same rate as that 
at which the solvent distils into the receiver. The use of a large flask for distilling 
the solution is thus rendered unnecessary. The distilling flask (alternatively, a 
Claisen flask with fractionating side-arm - see Fig. 2.108 - may be used, particu- 
larly if the residue is to be ultimately distilled under diminished pressure) should 
have a capacity of about twice the estimated volume of the residue after the re- 
moval of the solvent. The removal of the solvent in this manner is sometimes 
termed flash distillation. 

Relatively large volumes of solvents are conveniently removed by 'stripping' 
under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator (Section 2.27, Fig. 2.112). 

2.25 STEAM DISTILLATION 

Steam distillation 46,47 is a means of separating and purifying organic com- 
pounds. Essentially the operation consists of volatilising a substance by passing 
steam into a mixture of the compound and water. Provided the organic com- 



171 



2.25 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



pound has an appreciable vapour pressure (at least 5-10mm at 100 °C), it will 
distil with the steam. Steam distillation takes place at a temperature below the 
boiling point of water and hence, in numerous cases, well below the boiling point 
of the organic substance. This renders possible the purification of many sub- 
stances of high boiling point by low-temperature distillation, and is particularly 
valuable when the substances undergo decomposition when distilled alone at 
atmospheric pressure. It is also of importance in the separation of the desired 
organic compound: 



(b) 
(c) 



id) 
(e) 



from non-volatile tarry substances which are formed as by-products in 
many reactions; 

from aqueous mixtures containing dissolved inorganic salts; 
in those cases where other means of separation might lead to difficulties (e.g. 
the direct ether extraction of aniline, produced by the reduction of nitro- 
benzene by tin, etc., leads to troublesome emulsion formation owing to the 
alkali and the tin compounds present: Expt 6.48); 

from compounds which are not appreciably volatile in steam (e.g. o-nitro- 
phenol from p-nitrophenol: Expt 6.102); and 

from certain by-products which are steam volatile (e.g. biphenyl and excess 
of unreacted starting materials from the less volatile triphenylcarbinol: Expt 
5.42). 

A simple apparatus for steam distillation is shown in Fig. 2.102. Flask A con- 
tains the liquid to be steam distilled; it is fitted with the 'splash-head' B which 
prevents the carry-over of the contents of the flask A into the receiver. To carry 
out a steam distillation, the solution (or mixture of the solid with a little water) is 
placed in the flask A, and the apparatus is completely assembled. Steam is 
passed into flask A, which is itself heated by means of a flame to prevent too 
rapid an accumulation of water. If the substance crystallises in the condenser 
and tends to choke it, the water should be run out of the condenser for a few 
minutes until the solid material has been melted and carried by the steam into 
the receiver; the water should then be cautiously readmitted to the hot con- 
denser. It is best to use a condenser of the double surface type if the rate at which 
the steam distillation is carried out is rapid; if necessary two such condensers 
connected in series may be used since in most steam distillations best results are 
obtained when the process of distillation is carried out rapidly. The passage of 
steam is continued until no appreciable amount of water-insoluble material is 





Fig. 2.102 

172

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.26 



detected in the distillate (1). To discontinue the distillation the supply of steam is 
disconnected from the splash-head and the source of heat removed from flask A. 
The method of isolation of the organic compound from the distillate will depend 
upon the physical state and upon its water solubility. For example, a solid com- 
pound which is virtually insoluble in water would be removed by filtration; 
liquids and water-soluble solids would be isolated by batch or continuous sol- 
vent extraction procedures as described in Section 2.22. For the steam distilla- 
tion of small quantities of material a suitable design of apparatus is shown in 
Fig. 2.103. 

Note. (1) With water-insoluble materials distillation will usually be continued until the 
distillate is quite clear. For water-soluble materials a suitable chemical procedure for 
detection must be used, e.g. for aldehydic or ketonic compounds, portions of the distillate 
would be tested with an aqueous acidic solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. 

2.26 FRACTIONAL DISTILLATION AT ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE 

Unless the boiling points of the components of a mixture are widely different it is 
usual to employ a fractionating column to attempt the separation of liquid mix- 
tures by distillation. Apparatus for precision fractionation, which can success- 
fully separate mixtures in which the components have boiling points which differ 
by only a few degrees, is available, although careful operation and an appreci- 
ation of the factors which influence the efficiency of the fractionating column 
chosen are needed. 

A fractionating column consists essentially of a long vertical tube through 
which the vapour passes upward and is partially condensed; the condensate 
flows down the column and is returned eventually to the flask. Inside the column 
the returning liquid is brought into intimate contact with the ascending vapour 
and a heat interchange occurs whereby the vapour is enriched with the more 
volatile component at the expense of the liquid, in an attempt to reach equilib- 
rium within the liquid-vapour system. The conditions necessary for a good 
separation are: 

(a) comparatively large amounts of liquid continually returning through the 
column; 

(b) thorough mixing of liquid and vapour; 

(c) a large active surface of contact between liquid and vapour. 

Excessive cooling should be avoided; this difficulty is particularly apparent with 
liquids of high boiling point and may be overcome by suitably insulating or 
lagging the outer surface of the column or, if possible, by surrounding it with a 
vacuum jacket or an electrically heated jacket. 

The assembly shown in Fig. 2.104 illustrates a set-up for simple fractionation 
using a Vigreux column which has moderate fractionating efficiency and is prob- 
ably one of the most widely used columns. The column consists of a glass tube 
with a series of indentations such that alternate sets of indentations point down- 
wards at an angle of 45° in order to promote the redistribution of liquid from the 
walls to the centre of the column. The mixture to be fractionated is placed in a 
flask of convenient size (it should be one-third to one-half full), a few fragments 
of porous porcelain added and a water condenser attached to the side-arm. The 
distillate is collected in small flasks or in test tubes. The bulb of the thermometer 

173 



2.26 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




Fig. 2.104 

should be just below the level of the side-arm. It is advisable to lag the column to 
minimise the effect of draughts in producing excessive cooling. Lagging of the 
column is essential if the boiling point of any of the components exceeds 100 °C. 
The flask is then heated in an air bath, an oil bath, or a heating mantle (Section 
2.13), to ensure a uniform heating. The initial heating must not be hurried, as 
owing to the considerable extra condensation which occurs while the column is 
warming up, the latter may easily choke with liquid. Once distillation has com- 
menced, the rate of heating is adjusted so that the liquid passes over at the rate of 
one drop every two or three seconds. Under these conditions fairly efficient frac- 
tionation should be obtained. When the low boiling point fraction has passed 
over, distillation should cease. The heating is then slowly increased, and a sharp 
rise in boiling point should occur as the second fraction commences to distil; it is 
assumed, of course, that the fractionating system is capable of effecting a sharp 
fractionation of the components of the mixture. If the set-up is inefficient, a rela- 
tively large intermediate fraction may be obtained. It is desired to emphasise the 
fact that the distillation must be conducted slowly; no time is usually saved by 
distilling rapidly since a second fractionation will then be necessary. 

Other designs of fractionating columns commonly used are illustrated in Fig. 
2.105(a)-(c). The all-glass Dufton column (Fig. 2.105(a)) is a satisfactory fraction- 
ating column for general use. The glass spiral must be carefully ground to fit the 
outer tube in order to prevent appreciable leakage of vapour past the spiral. The 
length of the spiral is usually 15 or 30 cm, the internal diameter of the tube is 15- 
20 mm and the distance between the turns of the spiral is 9-13 mm; the cone and 
socket are 19/26 or 24/29. This type of column has the advantage of a small 
hold-up (i.e. a low volume of liquid is retained within the column compared to 
the flask charge), but it is of relatively low efficiency. 

The pear-bulb column (Fig. 2.105(b)) is a precision-bore tube with accurately 
fitting removable bulbs which fit closely to form a liquid seal between the bulbs 
and the walls of the column. Additional mixing between the ascending vapour 

174 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.26 



Fig. 2.105 

and the descending liquid is provided by inserting small glass 'bubbles' between 
the separate pear-bulbs. 

The Hempel column (Fig. 2.105(c)) is a single glass tube, 25 to 75 cm long and 
15 to 25 mm diameter, fitted with either 24/29, 29/32 or 34/35 ground glass 
joints, which may be filled to within 5 cm of the top with a suitable packing. This 
packing is supported by a small glass spiral of appropriate size. A number of 
excellent column packings are available commercially. The simplest and cheap- 
est, yet very efficient, packing consists of hollow glass rings {Raschig rings), of 6 
or 9 mm length and 6 or 9 mm diameter; similar hollow porcelain rings are 
almost equally effective. 

Single-turn glass helices (Fenske rings) are an alternative but somewhat more 
expensive packing for Hempel fractionating columns. A convenient size for 
single-turn helices is 4.0 mm external diameter and 0.50 mm rod thickness: one 
kilo of these occupies almost 2 litres. These helices form a closely-spaced packing 
providing maximum contact between the continuously moving liquid and 
vapour streams and at the same time allowing for good 'through-put' of 
descending liquid and ascending vapour. 

A detailed discussion of the theory of fractional distillation is to be found in 
other texts, 48 ' 49 but a brief description of the terms used in discussing fraction- 
ating columns and the chief desiderata for efficient columns will be given. The 
capacity of a column is a measure of the quantity of vapour and liquid which can 
be passed counter-current to each other in a column without causing it to choke 
or flood. The efficiency of a column is the separating power of a definite length of 
the column; it is measured by comparing the performance of the column with 
that calculated for a theoretically perfect plate column under similar conditions. 
A theoretical plate is denned as the length of distilling column such that the 
vapour leaving the plate has the same composition as the vapour which would 



175 



2.26 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



be in stationary equilibrium with liquid at that temperature, as obtained from 
the vapour-liquid phase diagram. Since the efficiency of the column depends on 
the establishment of equilibrium conditions between ascending vapour and des- 
cending liquid by thorough and intimate mixing, it is clear that the removal of 
the more volatile component from the top of the column should be as slow as 
possible. The number of theoretical plates cannot be determined from the 
dimensions of the fractionating column; it is computed from the separation 
effected by distillation of a liquid mixture (e.g. benzene and toluene; benzene and 
carbon tetrachloride; benzene and dichloroethane; heptane and methylcyclo- 
hexane), the vapour and liquid compositions of which are accurately known. An 
ordinary 1-cm tube 1 metre long might be equivalent to only one theoretical 
plate, while the same tube filled with a suitable packing can give the equivalent 
of twenty of more theoretical plates. A column with twelve theoretical plates is 
satisfactory for the practical separation of a mixture of benzene and toluene 
(Ab.p. 30 °C); where the two components of a mixture differ in b.p. by only about 
3 °C, a column with approximately 100 theoretical plates would be required. The 
effectiveness of a column depends upon the height as well as upon the packing or 
internal construction, hence the efficiency is frequently expressed in terms of the 
height equivalent per theoretical plate (HETP). It is obtained by dividing the 
height by the number of theoretical plates, and is usually stated in centimetres. 
For the comparison of the relative efficiencies of fractionating columns, the 
operating procedure should be standardised. 

The ideal fractionation yields a series of sharply defined fractions, each distill- 
ing at a definite temperature. After each fraction has distilled, the temperature 
rises rapidly, no liquid being distilled as an intermediate fraction. If the temper- 
ature is plotted against the volume of the distillate in such an ideal fractionation, 
the graph obtained is a series of alternate horizontal and vertical lines resem- 
bling a staircase. A more or less sloping break reveals the presence of an inter- 
mediate fraction and the amount of such fraction can be used as a qualitative 
criterion of the performance of different columns. The ultimate aim in the design 
of efficient fractionating columns is to reduce the proportion of the intermediate 
fractions to a minimum. The most important factors which influence the separa- 
tion of mixtures into sharp fractions are the following: 

1. Time of distillation. For any column there is always an optimum time of distil- 
lation below which accuracy is sacrificed and above which the slightly im- 
proved separation does not justify the extra time taken. For most laboratory 
columns this will vary between 1 hour and 8-10 hours. 

2. Hold-up of column. The hold-up of liquid should be reduced to a minimum 
compatible with scrubbing effectiveness and an adequate column capacity. 
The ratio of charge of the still to the hold-up of the column should be as large 
as possible; in general, the still charge should be at least twenty times the 
hold-up. 

3. Thermal insulation. Even slight heat losses considerably disturb the delicate 
equilibrium of an efficient column, and almost perfect thermal insulation is 
required for the separation of compounds with boiling points only a few 
degrees apart. Theoretically, the greatest efficiency is obtained under 
adiabatic conditions. If the components boil below 100°C, a silvered vacuum 
jacket is satisfactory; the efficiency of such a jacket will depend upon the care 
with which it is cleaned, silvered and exhausted. In general, the most satisfac- 



176 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.26 



tory insulation is provided by the application of heat to balance the heat loss. 
An electrically-heated insulating tape is fitted round the column; the temper- 
ature of the tape, which should be controlled by means of an external resist- 
ance or a variable voltage transformer (Variac), should be adjusted within 
5 °C of the temperature of the vapour condensing at the upper end of the 
column. 
4. Reflux ratio. This is defined as the ratio between the number of moles of 
vapour returned as refluxed liquid to the fractionating column and the 
number of moles of final product (collected as distillate), both per unit time. 
The reflux ratio should be varied according to the difficulty of fractionation, 
rather than be maintained constant; a high efficiency of separation requires a 
high reflux ratio.* 

Otherwise expressed, the number of theoretical plates required for a given 
separation increases when the reflux ratio is decreased, i.e. when the amount of 
condensed vapour returned to the column is decreased and the amount distilled 
off becomes greater. The variation in the reflux ratio is achieved by the use of a 
suitable take-off head (or still-head), usually of the total condensation variable 
take-off type. In use, all the vapour is condensed and the bulk of the condensate 
is returned to the fractionating column, small fractions of the condensate being 
allowed to collect in a suitable receiver. The design may be appreciated from the 
line diagram shown in Fig. 2.107 in which the controlled collection of distillate is 
by the socket -cone screw-operated valve sited just below the condenser drip end. 

Figure 2.106 shows a generally useful fractional distillation unit employing 
a packing of glass helices (Gallenkamp). The column is provided with an 
electrically-heated jacket the temperature of which may be adjusted with an 
energy regulator. The still-head is of the total condensation variable take-off 
type; all vapour at the top of the column is condensed, a portion of the conden- 
sate is returned to the column by means of the special stopcock (which permits 
fine adjustment of the reflux ratio) and the remainder is collected in the receiver. 
The advantages of the still-head are that true equilibrium conditions can be 
established before any distillate is collected; this is particularly important when 
the jacket temperature must be controlled. Furthermore changing from a lower 
to a higher boiling point fraction is comparatively easy. The stopcock is closed 
and the liquid is allowed to reflux until the thermometer records the lowest tem- 
perature possible; at this point the column is effecting its maximum degree of 
separation and an equilibrium condition is reached. The tap is then partially 
opened and the distillate is collected in the receiver until the temperature begins 
to rise. The stopcock is then closed and equilibrium conditions again estab- 
lished, and a further fraction is removed. In this way sharper separations may be 
obtained. Further improvement results from the use of a capillary tube to drain 
the condensate into the receiver. The reflux ratio may be measured approxi- 
mately by counting the number of drops of liquid which fall back into the col- 



* The more difficult the fractionation, the greater the reflux ratio to be employed. Thus for com- 
pounds differing only slightly in boiling point, this may be as high as 50 to 1; for liquids of wider 
boiling point range, thus permitting of fairly easy separation, a reflux ratio of 5 or 10 to 1 may be 
used. 

Beyond certain limits increase of the reflux ratio does not appreciably increase the separating 
power or efficiency of the column. As a rough guide, if the column has an efficiency of n plates at total 
reflux, the reflux ratio should be between 2n/3 and 3n/2. 

177 



226 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

umn as compared with the number of drops which fall into the receiver flask (the 
liquid drops falling off the slanting ends of the drip tubes are readily observable). 
The vacuum distillation adapter also shown in Fig. 2.106 allows the collec- 
tion of fractions when distilling under reduced pressure. Its operation is similar 
to the 'Perkin triangle' or equivalent device ('intermediate receiver adapter') de- 
scribed in Section 2.27. The general technique of conducting a fractional distilla- 
tion is as follows: 

1. Charge the flask with the mixture, and attach to the column. Set the still-head 
for total reflux and heat the flask until the material begins to reflux into the 
column. Then heat the column very slowly until the refluxing liquid reaches 
the top of the column and the boiling point registers on the thermometer. 
Adjust the temperature in (or near the top of) the jacket, as recorded on the 
thermometer (just visible in diagram), adjacent to the column until it is just 
below (i.e. within 5°C) the boiling point recorded in the vapour. With 
random packings, such as Fenske or Raschig rings, the column should first be 
flooded in order to coat the packing completely with liquid; it is then oper- 



178 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.26 



ated under total reflux until the equilibrium is attained (about 1 hour per ten 
theoretical plates). 

2. When the column has reached equilibrium, adjust the head to give the desired 
reflux ratio, change the receiver and collect the lowest boiling point com- 
ponent over an appropriate distillation range, say 1-2 °C. During the distilla- 
tion, maintain as high a rate of reflux as possible consistent with prevention 
of flooding the column; under these conditions the reflux ratio is controlled 
by the rate of take-off. As the lowest boiling component is removed, the pro- 
portion of it in the distillation flask gradually decreases and eventually a mix- 
ture of two components reaches the top of the column, and this will be 
indicated by a slight rise in boiling point. When this occurs, gradually in- 
crease the reflux ratio, i.e. decrease the rate of take-off: this will make it pos- 
sible to collect the lowest boiling point fraction over a narrow range; 
eventually a point will be reached when even with a high reflux ratio the boil- 
ing point rises. At this stage, change the receiver and commence the collection 
of the intermediate fraction. 

3. During the distillation of the intermediate fraction, keep the rate of take-off 
very slow. The boiling point will rise and eventually either remain constant or 
increase very slowly. At this point, change the receiver, adjust the tempera- 
ture of the heating jacket again and collect the second fraction over a narrow 
distillation range - rapidly so long as the temperature remains essentially 
constant, then more slowly until finally the second intermediate fraction is 
reached again while distilling very slowly. Change the receiver, collect the 
intermediate fraction and proceed as before for the third component, etc. 

The following general comments upon situations which may arise during 
fractionation may be helpful: 

(a) The sharper the fractionation, the smaller, of course, is the intermediate 
fraction. If the difference in boiling points of the components being separ- 
ated is considerable, the separation will be so facile that practically all the 
lower boiling point component will be removed whilst the boiling point 
remains essentially constant. Eventually the upper part of the column will 
begin to run dry, distillation will slow up and finally stop, while the reflux at 
the bottom of the column will be heavy. The vapour temperature may begin 
to fall until it is below the temperature at the top of the heating jacket. Mere 
increase of the bath temperature may result in the flooding of the column: 
the power input to the heating jacket must be gradually increased until 
reflux again reaches the top of the column, the boiling point begins to rise 
and eventually becomes constant; the temperature in the jacket is main- 
tained just below the boiling point of the vapour. 

(b) As the rate of take-off is reduced near the end of a fraction, a slight lowering 
of the bath temperature may be necessary to avoid flooding of the column. 
Also as the boiling point rises during the collection of the intermediate frac- 
tion, the power input to the jacket must be increased in order to hold its 
temperature just below the boiling point. 

(c) If the column is flooding near the top and there is little reflux at the bottom, 
the jacket temperature is too high. If there is normal heavy reflux at the 
bottom of the column and there is flooding at the top, the bath temperature 
is probably too high. If the column is flooding near the bottom and there is 
little reflux near the top, the jacket temperature is too low. 



179 



2.26 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(d) If it is desired to collect the liquid remaining in the column at the end of the 
fractionation (constituting the 'hold-up'), the column may be stripped by 
the addition of a 'chaser' at the beginning of the fractional distillation in a 
quantity somewhat greater than the estimated 'hold-up'. The boiling point 
of the 'chaser' should be at least 20 C C higher than the final boiling point of 
the material being fractionated. For this operation the bath temperature is 
kept sufficiently high to distil the end component, and the jacket tempera- 
ture is carefully and slowly raised above the boiling point of the component. 
'Chasers' should be chemically inert, inexpensive, and should not form azeo- 
tropic mixtures with the components of the mixture undergoing fractiona- 
tion; examples are: toluene, b.p. 110°C; p-cymene, b.p. 175°C; tetralin, b.p. 
207 °C; diphenyl ether, b.p. 259 °C. 

When it is required to separate by fractional distillation components of a 
mixture which differ in their boiling points by only a few degrees, the spinning- 
band fractionating column offers the best chance of success. The fractionating 
column consists of a vertical glass tube into which is accurately fitted through- 
out its length a spiral of Teflon or metal gauze (platinum, stainless steel or 
Monel) which is fixed to a central Teflon or metal rod and which has a diameter 
very slightly less than the internal bore diameter of the tube. The spiral extends 
through the reflux condenser of the specially designed, integral, total- 
condensation variable take-off still-head, and may be spun by means of either 
direct or magnetic couplings to an electric motor (Fig. 2.107). The central rod of 
the spinning band extends into the distillation flask and terminates in a Teflon

stirrer to ensure smooth boiling. The column may be jacketed with a Nichrome 
heating element or alternatively the column and still-head may be vacuum 
jacketed and silvered. The advantage of the spinning band (which rotates at 
selected speeds between 600 and 3000 r.p.m.) is that it increases vapour-liquid 
contact upon which the column efficiency depends, by causing the vapour to be 
thrown on to the column walls, and into contact with the liquid descending as a 
thin film. Furthermore these columns have little tendency to flood and have a 
low hold-up which therefore allows their high efficiency to be realised to the full. 
When deliberately flooded they rapidly clear and liquid-vapour equilibrium is 
re-attained. The spinning band has the further advantage of assisting the pas- 
sage of vapours through the column. This reduces the pressure difference which 
always exists between the top (lower pressure) and bottom (higher pressure) 
regions of a fractionating column. This pressure difference depends upon the 
dimensions of the column, the nature of the column packing and the rate of dis- 
tillation. A large pressure drop is undesirable since it leads to a higher heat input 
at the distillation flask being needed to sweep the vapours to the still-head. With 
a spinning-band column this difference may be as low as 0.23 mmHg. This small 
pressure drop is a feature which makes this column design particularly suitable 
for fractional distillations under reduced pressure (see Section 2.27). 

2.27 DISTILLATION UNDER DIMINISHED PRESSURE ('VACUUM' 
DISTILLATION) 50 

Many organic substances cannot be distilled satisfactorily under atmospheric 
pressure because they undergo partial or complete decomposition before the 
normal boiling point is reached. By reducing the external pressure to 0.1- 
30 mmHg, the boiling point is considerably reduced and the distillation may 
usually be conducted without danger of decomposition. 

In a vacuum distillation apparatus certain features should be present to facili- 
tate the ease of operation and these have been incorporated into the assembly 
illustrated in Fig. 2.108. A is a pear-shaped Claisen-Vigreux flask, the left-hand 
neck of which carries a screw-cap adapter through which is inserted a glass tube 
B of appropriate diameter drawn out to a capillary C, at its lower end (1). The 
tube B carries at its upper end a short piece of pressure tubing and a screw clip 
D.* The condenser carries a three-limbed multiple receiver and adapter E, fre- 
quently called a l pig\ the outlet being connected via a suitable trap and mano- 
meter (Section 2.30) to either a water or an oil pump (Section 2.29). The pig 
adapter permits the collection of three individual fractions without breaking the 
vacuum and interrupting the progress of the distillation. The flask is heated 
either by means of an air bath or by means of a water or oil bath as appropriatef 

* After some experience it will be found that a drawn-out capillary tube of the correct size may be 
prepared; the rubber tubing and the screw clip D are then omitted. 

If pressure tubing is used, it is advisable to insert a short length of thin metal wire (e.g. copper 
wire, 22 gauge) to prevent the tubing being closed completely by the screw clip. 
t Experienced laboratory workers sometimes employ a large free flame for liquids which tend to 
froth considerably; by directing the flame for the most part at approximately the level of the surface 
of the liquid and heating the circumference evenly with a 'rotating' flame, the frothing may be 
reduced and the distillation carried out with comparative safety. Boiling points which are slightly 
high may be obtained by the use of a free frame unless the liquid is distilled slowly.

(Section 2.13); in the latter case the bulb of the flask is immersed at least two- 
thirds into the bath, which should contain a thermometer. 

To carry out a distillation (under the reduced pressures obtainable with a 
water pump), the liquid is poured into the Claisen flask so that it is about one- 
half full (the apparatus is completely assembled as in Fig. 2.108) and the water 
supply to the condenser is turned on. The water pump is then allowed to reach 
its maximum capacity with the screw clip D almost fully closed (2). The latter is 
then adjusted so that a fine stream of air bubbles passes through the liquid in 
order to minimise 'bumping' in the subsequent distillation.* (The introduction 
of a gas (air) tends to prevent a delay in the appearance of vapour and thus to 
prevent superheating; the volume of air introduced in the form of minute 
bubbles is small so that the effect of the partial pressure upon the boiling point 
will usually be negligible.) When the mercury level in the manometer (Section 
2.30) is steady, the pressure in the system is noted. If the pressure is unsatisfact- 
ory, the apparatus must be carefully tested for leaks and these eliminated before 
the distillation can be commenced; special attention should be paid to ensure 
that all the glass joints are firmly in position and not contaminated by grit, and 
that the rubber pressure tubing fits tightly over the glass connections. When a 
satisfactory vacuum has been achieved the flask is heated. With a water or oil 
bath, the temperature of the bath should be 20-25 °C above the boiling point of 
the liquid at the recorded pressures. If an air bath is employed, the temperature 
is slowly raised until the liquid commences to distil, and the heating is main- 
tained at this intensity so that the liquid distils at the rate of 1-2 drops per 
second. (For high boiling point liquids, it is advantageous to lag the neck of the 
flask below the outlet tube.) The readings on the thermometer and manometer 
are taken frequently during the course of distillation. If the initial distillate boils 

* For air-sensitive compounds the capillary leak should be connected to a suitable nitrogen gas 
supply.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.27 



at a lower temperature than that expected, the heating is continued until the 
thermometer records a temperature near that anticipated, and the receiver is 
then changed by rotation of the pig to bring a clean flask under the condenser 
outlet. For a pure compound the boiling point will not rise more than a degree 
or two during the whole of the distillation, even when the bath temperature has 
to be raised considerably towards the end to drive off the last of the liquid. At the 
conclusion of the distillation the heating bath is removed, the 'vacuum' is gradu- 
ally released and the screw clip on D is fully opened (this will prevent any liquid 
entering the capillary). 

If the pressure during distillation is not exactly that given in the recorded 
boiling point, it may be estimated very approximately for the working pressures 
of a water pump (10-25 mm) by assuming that a difference of 1 mm in pressure 
corresponds to one degree difference in the boiling point. Table 2.10 may be 
found useful as a guide to the approximate boiling point under diminished pres- 
sure when the boiling point under atmospheric pressure is known; it will enable 
the student to select the thermometer employed in the distillation.

Notes. (1) The capillary when drawn out should be sufficiently robust so that it is not 
broken during the vigorous boiling but should have a degree of flexibility to permit some 
movement of the capillary during distillation; this is particularly advantageous when 
round-bottomed flasks are used. Furthermore the bore should be such that only a fine 
stream of bubbles is admitted to the flask when the vacuum is initially applied. The suc- 
cessful construction of a suitable capillary requires some practice and it is usually helpful 
to perform the operation in two stages. Initially a length of Pyrex tubing (c. 15 cm x 
5 mm) is rotated in the flame of an oxygen-gas burner so that about 2 cm in the middle of 
the tube is heated to dull redness. The softened glass is allowed to thicken gently before it 
is removed from the flame and extended by a few centimetres (Fig. 2.109(a)). The second 
stage is to reheat with a needle flame a narrow section of the thickened portion which 
when pliable is extended by a steady pulling action (Fig. 2.109(6)). Experience will deter- 
mine how the speed and length of extension affects the dimensions of the final capillary. 
The capillary is then cut to the length required so that when it is inserted into the flask the 
end comes within 1-2 mm of the bottom. 

(2) If the material in the flask contains traces of volatile solvents, it is advisable to allow 
the passage of a comparatively large volume of air through the liquid while warming the 



(b)

183 



2.27 PRACTICAL 0R6AN1C CHEMISTRY 



flask slightly; this drives off the last traces of volatile solvents, which are carried down the 
water pump. If this is not done, the pressure obtained when testing out the apparatus will 
be above the real capacity of the pump, and the student will erroneously assume either 
that the pump is not functioning efficiently or that leaks are present in the apparatus. 
When all traces of volatile solvents have been removed, the screw clip D is almost com- 
pletely closed or otherwise adjusted. 

When it is necessary to use an oil vacuum pump to attain lower pressures, it is essential 
to prevent large volumes of solvent vapour from passing into the pumping system. The 
oil pump should therefore be guarded with a suitable trap; furthermore distillation at 
water pump pressures should first be used to remove the bulk of low boiling solvent 
before the oil pump is brought into operation. 

For the fractional distillation of mixtures under diminished pressure, when a 
more efficient fractionating column is necessary, the pig type of adapter should 
be replaced by the more versatile Perkin-type receiver adapter to enable the more 
numerous fractions to be collected conveniently. The complete apparatus for 
vacuum distillation is depicted in Fig. 2.110. The two-necked round-bottomed 
flask A is fitted with a Hempel column (packed with Fenske rings) connected via 
a still-head with thermometer to a water-cooled condenser which terminates in 
the Perkin receiver adapter. The stopcocks may be of the ground glass type as 
shown or of the Rotaflo (HP) design. The capillary leak shown illustrates a 
simple alternative arrangement to that described above. Here the take-off 
adapter B (see also Fig. 2.27(a)) carries a short length of pressure tubing C, fitted 
with a screw clip D. A convenient length of fine capillary tube, which must be 
flexible yet reasonably robust, is threaded through the tubing and located in 
position by tightening the clip D. 

To carry out the distillation the flask is charged and the apparatus assembled. 
Before evacuating the system the tap F is closed to isolate the receiver E from the 
flask J, but the taps H and G are turned so as to connect the pump to the 
receiver E (via H) and to the flask J (via G). The apparatus is now evacuated 




Fig. 2.110 

184 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.27 



until a steady pressure reading is obtained on the manometer (checking for leaks 
as previously) and the flask is heated by an air or oil bath until distillation com- 
mences. The initial distillate is allowed to run directly into the flask J by turning 
the tap F; as soon as observation of the thermometer shows that a steady boiling 
fraction is distilling, the tap F is closed and the required fraction is allowed to 
collect in E, noting the thermometer and manometer readings. While distillation 
is taking place, the three-way tap G is turned to admit air to the flask J, which is 
then removed and replaced by a clean receiver. The vacuum in J is now restored, 
by first isolating the distillation unit from the pumping system by closing the tap 
H, and then connecting J to the pump via the tap G. When a steady pressure is 
once more attained, the tap H is opened and the contents of E allowed to flow 
into J by opening F. When the boiling point of the distillate indicates that a new 
fraction is beginning to distil, this is isolated in E by means of the tap F and the 
procedure for changing the receiver J is repeated. 

For vacuum fractional distillation of liquids having close boiling points, 
which necessitates the use of a total condensation variable take-off head, the 
receiver adapter modification noted in Fig. 2.106 is employed. Its operation is 
similar to that of the Perkin triangle; the column is operated under total reflux 
while the receivers are being changed. 

The high efficiency and small pressure drop of the spinning-band columns 
(Fig. 2.107) makes them very suitable for precision vacuum fractional distilla- 
tion. The still-head is provided with a type of Perkin triangle assembly which 
allows the receivers to be changed without disturbing the column equilibrium. 

Vacuum distillation on the semimicro scale (1-8 ml) is conveniently carried 
out using the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2.1 1 1 . Although this design is not now 
available commercially, many research laboratories still have this useful piece of 





Fig. 2.111

2.28 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



equipment, and in any case, should the need arise it may be readily constructed 
by a competent glass blower. It should be pointed out also that quantities of 
liquid within this range, containing components of close boiling point, may be 
more easily separated by preparative g.l.c. (Section 2.31), and this may often be 
the method of choice. 

The rapid removal of a large quantity of volatile solvent from a solution of an 
organic compound (i.e. from a solvent extraction process) is conveniently 
effected by using the Rotary Film Evaporator (Fig. 2.1 12, Jencons). Evaporation 
is conducted under reduced pressure (a water pump is the most convenient) and 
therefore at relatively low temperatures. The evaporator flask is heated to the 
appropriate temperature on a water bath, and is rotated during evaporation; 
this ensures thorough mixing, prevents bumping and also exposes a relatively 
large liquid film. The solvent distils from the evaporating surface, is condensed 
by the spiral condenser and runs off into the receiving flask. Further quantities 
of the solution may be added through the feed-tube controlled by the stopcock. 
A quick-action jack with built-in tension spring is sometimes fitted; the operator 
may lift or lower the assembly and secure it in any desired position within pre- 
set upper and lower limits. Various sizes of specially shaped flasks are available 
or, alternatively, round-bottomed flasks with appropriate ground glass joints 
may be used satisfactorily. 

2.28 HIGH VACUUM DISTILLATION - MOLECULAR DISTILLATION 

The apparatus designs which have been described in the previous section for dis- 
tillation under reduced pressure are virtually useless for the distillation of com- 
pounds having very high boiling points, which need to be distilled at pressures in 
the region of 10" 5 mmHg (or mbar) if decomposition is to be avoided. Success- 
ful distillation is achieved in a greatly simplified distillation unit in which the 
chief feature is the short direct path between a heated liquid surface and the 
cooled condensing area (molecular distillation, short path distillation). 51,52 

In molecular distillation, the permanent gas pressure is so low (less than 
0.001 mmHg) that it has very little influence upon the speed of the distillation. 
The distillation velocity at such low pressures is determined by the speed at 
which the vapour from the liquid being distilled can flow through the enclosed 
space connecting the still and condenser under the driving force of its own 
saturation pressure. If the distance from the surface of the evaporating liquid to 
the condenser is less than (or of the order of) the mean free path of a molecule of 
distillate vapour in the residual gas at the same density and pressure, most of the 
molecules which leave the surface will not return. The mean free path of air at 
various pressures is as follows: 

Pressure (mmHg) 1.0 0.1 0.01 0.001 

Mean free path (cm) 0.0056 0.0562 0.562 5.62 

The mean free path of large organic molecules is shorter; it is evident, therefore, 
that the condenser must be quite close to the evaporating surface. Strictly speak- 
ing, a molecular still may be defined as a still in which the distance between the 
evaporating surface and the cold condensing surface is less than the mean free 
path of the molecules. The escaping molecules will, for the most part, proceed in 
a straight path to the condenser; by maintaining the temperature of the latter 

186 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.28 



comparatively low, the amount of reflection of molecules from the condensing 
surface is reduced. The great advantage of distillation under a high vacuum is 
that the 'boiling point' is considerably reduced - in some cases by as much as 
200-300 °C - thus rendering possible the distillation of substances which decom- 
pose at higher temperatures, of substances which are very sensitive to heat, and 
also of compounds of very high boiling point and large molecular weight. 

When the evaporating liquid is a single substance, the rate of evaporation will 
be pc/s grams per square cm per second, where p is the density of the saturated 
vapour at the given temperature, c is the mean molecular velocity and s the 
mean free path of a distillate molecule. If the liquid is a mixture, the rate of evap- 
oration of the rth component will be p r c r /s grams per square cm per second. The 
separation obtained in a molecular distillation thus depends upon the quantity 
p r c r , unlike the separation obtained in ordinary distillation, where the vapour is 
in equilibrium with the liquid, which depends upon p r . Since c r is inversely pro- 
portional to the square root of the molecular weight, and the magnitude of p r is 
in general greatest for the components of least molecular weight, p r c r is greatest 
for constituents of least molecular weight. Molecular distillation (sometimes 
termed evaporative distillation) is the only method by which substances of high 
molecular weight can be distilled without decomposition. According to Lang- 
muir (1917) the theoretical rate of distillation can be written in the form: 



1 



InMRT 



where w is the weight of substance evaporating per square cm of liquid surface 
per second, M is the molecular weight of the liquid, R the gas constant and Tthe 
absolute temperature. In practice, lower values are obtained because of the re- 
flection of molecules from the condensing surface. 

The vacuum sublimation apparatus (Fig. 2.88) is particularly suitable when 
only small quantities (10-50 mg) of fairly viscous high boiling liquids need to be 
distilled. The design offers the least hindrance to the flow of vapour from the 
evaporating to the condensing surface. The rate of distillation is determined by 
the rate at which the liquid surface is able to produce vapour. Since a liquid 
sample may almost certainly contain dissolved gases, or solvents which have 
been used to aid its transference to the distillation chamber, even greater care 
must be taken in applying the vacuum than is the case with the sublimation of 
solids. Initially a stopper should be used in place of the cold finger. To avoid ex- 
cessive frothing and splashing the vacuum must be reduced very gradually and 
the temperature increased in careful stages. Initially the vacuum attainable with 
a water pump is employed and the temperature increased slowly by immersion 
of the distillation unit in a water bath at a suitably controlled temperature; 
gentle agitation of the unit during the heating will aid the removal of solvent and 
keep frothing to a minimum. When ebullition has ceased the water pump is re- 
placed by an oil pump and the vacuum slowly reapplied and the gentle heating 
continued. Only when it is clear that no further volatile material is being 
removed (and often this may take up to an hour or so) is the stopper replaced by 
the cold finger, the apparatus connected to the source of high vacuum and the 
molecular distillation commenced. The vacuum required is that provided by a 
suitable vapour diffusion pump, and the complete assembly required for the dis- 
tillation is illustrated schematically in Fig. 2.1 13. The individual components are

the distillation unit A, the vapour traps B, a simple uncalibrated mercury mano- 
meter C, the vapour diffusion pump D (Section 2.29), a phosphoric oxide mois- 
ture trap E, an oil immersion rotatory 'backing' pump F (Section 2.29) and the 
McLeod gauge or Pirani/Penning gauge G (Section 2.30).* These components 
are connected with wide-bore glass tubing having the minimum number of 
bends and fitted with ground glass joints sealed with Apiezon wax W, or better 
with joints of the O-ring seal type (Section 2.8) as appropriate. The wide-bore 
vacuum taps H-M are sited at the points indicated to enable sections of the 
assembly to be isolated and to facilitate vacuum control and measurement. The 
entire apparatus, without of course the unit A, is usually permanently assembled 
on laboratory scaffolding with the section between taps K and M, together with 
the McLeod gauge, kept permanently under vacuum. A manostat (Section 2.30) 
may be attached to the outlet from tap J if a pressure higher than that produced 
from the pumping system is required. 

In use, with all the taps in the closed position, the distillation unit A is 
attached to the ground glass joint which is fitted to tap H; the Dewar flasks sur- 
rounding the vapour traps are filled with suitable coolant (Cardice-acetone, or 
liquid nitrogen), and the condenser water to the vapour diffusion pump and to 
the cold finger (or condenser) of A turned on. The backing pump is switched on 
and the taps M, L, K and H are opened in sequence so that the system is evacu- 
ated to the pressure attainable with this pump. The pressure in the system is 
indicated by the auxiliary manometer C, which can also be used to check for 
leaks in the apparatus by closing M and noting any fluctuations in its mercury 
level. When the backing pump has been reconnected to the system by turning 
tap M, the heat supply to the vapour diffusion pump is brought into operation 
and the system allowed to reach the minimum pressure as indicated by the 
McLeod gauge (see Section 2.30 for the operation of this gauge). It is at this 
stage that the manostat is operated, if required, by connecting it to the system 
via tap J. The distillation unit A is now heated slowly in an oil bath until misting 
of the cold finger is observed when the temperature of the oil bath should be 
noted and maintained at this level. The reading on the McLeod or Pirani/ 
Penning gauge should be checked periodically during the progress of the distil- 
lation. At the conclusion of the distillation the heat supply to the vapour diffu- 
sion pump is disconnected and the unit A isolated by closing tap H. After 
allowing several minutes to elapse to allow the temperature of the diffusion 
pump fluidf and the distillation unit A to drop substantially, tap K is closed and 

* It is highly desirable that a portable safety screen suitably located should be provided between the 
operator and the distillation unit and vacuum system illustrated. 

t This is particularly important in those cases where the fluid in the vapour diffusion pump is 
Apiezon oil and is heated by electrical means. The capacity of the heating element is such that over- 
heating of the oil occurs leading to 'cracking' with the formation of lower boiling components which 
diminish the efficiency of the vapour diffusion pump in any subsequent operation.

the backing pump switched off after connecting it to the atmosphere via the 
three-way tap M. The pin-hole three-way tap I is opened carefully to admit air 
to the traps B which are then dismantled for cleaning, drying and reassembly. 
Tap H is opened and the unit A dismantled when it has reached room tempera- 
ture. The water supply to the condensers is finally turned off 

In cases where the quantity of material to be distilled is such that there is a 
danger of drainage of droplets of condensed liquid from the cold finger, a small 
collection cup may be attached to the cold finger by means of platinum wire suit- 
ably fused to the two glass surfaces (Fig. 2.114). Alternatively the Wheaton- 
Hickman flask (Aldrich) (Fig. 2.115) may be used; note in this case the screw 
thread joint. 

An apparatus for the high vacuum distillation of larger quantities is the 
Hickman vacuum still shown in Fig. 2.116; it is about 600mm in diameter, 
45 mm high and will hold about 40 ml of liquid. The roof of the still is filled with 
ice-water or any appropriate freezing mixture. A modification which permits 
continuous flow of cooling liquid over the roof of the still is shown in Fig. 2.117. 

Small quantities (0.1-2 g) of material may be distilled using the distillation 
unit shown in Fig. 2.1 18 which is readily constructed from 9-mm-diameter Pyrex 
tubing, the bulbs being made to a size appropriate to the size of sample. The 
material to be distilled is diluted with a little solvent so that it can be introduced

in stages directly into the distillation bulb, without contaminating the sides of 
the tube, by means of a capillary pipette. After each addition the solvent is 
removed in the usual careful manner and the residue prepared for the final 
vacuum distillation as in the former cases. The unit is supported by a retort 
stand and clamp so that the receiver tube slopes slightly downward and the dis- 
tillation bulb is encased in an air bath or immersed in an oil bath. The vacuum is 
allowed to reach a steady value before heating of the air or the oil bath by means 
of a controlled flame is commenced. Liquid distils into the first indentation and 
the temperature and pressure is noted. The indentations further along the tube 
prevent further distilled material flowing to waste. 

A design of apparatus* which has found particular use in the editors' labora- 
tories for the distillation of viscous high boiling monosaccharide derivatives 
under high vacuum (10" 5 mmHg) in relatively large amounts (up to 100 g) is 
shown in Fig. 2.119. Preliminary removal of volatile solvents from the material 
is carried out in a round-bottomed flask on a rotary evaporator under water- 
pump pressure and then by means of an oil vacuum pump which is fitted with a 
series of suitable cooled solvent traps. The hot solvent-free material, while still in 
an adequately fluid state, is then poured into the distillation retort using a pre- 
warmed, long-necked, wide-tube funnel, the end of which reaches into the distil- 
lation bulb. In this way contamination of the inside of the unit is avoided, and 
removal of last traces of solvent, which would be tiresome on this scale, 
obviated. A pine splint is inserted into the flask to prevent 'bumping' during the 
distillation, which is effected by evacuating the flask with the aid of a suitable 
high vacuum source and heating it in an oil bath. 

These latter pieces of equipment may be called bulb-to-bulb distillation units. 
A commercial form is the Kugelrohr apparatus (Aldrich). The material to be dis- 
tilled is placed in a suitably sized round-bottomed flask (one-third full) and 
attached to the receiver flask train (Fig. 2.120). This arrangement is connected to 
a horizontal drive shaft which enables the bulbs to be gently rocked by a safe air- 
or vacuum-operated oscillating motor, which speeds distillation and prevents 
bumping. The distillation flask may be heated up to 225 °C in an i.r.-radiant 
heater. The hollow drive shaft may be connected to a vacuum pumping system 
and the apparatus operates down to 1 x 10" 5 mmHg.

2.29 VACUUM PUMPS 

The two principal operations in an organic preparative laboratory which re- 
quire the use of a vacuum pump are those of nitration and distillation under 
reduced pressure. The effectiveness of the vacuum attained by a pumping system 
may be quoted as centimetres/millimetres of mercury, or as a torr value, 
although recently the use of the millibar (mbar), has become widespread. The 
interrelationship of these units is: 

760mmHg (0°C) = 1013.2 mbar, and 1 torr = 1 mmHg (0°C) 

WATER PUMPS. 

The high-pressure water supply is employed for the operation of the ordinary 
'filter pump', which finds so many applications in the laboratory. Several types 
of water-jet pumps of glass, plastic or metal construction are available from 
most laboratory suppliers. These are often fitted with a suitable non-return 
valve to prevent the apparatus being flooded as a result of fluctuating water 
pressure. Connection to the water tap in the case of the metal pump is by a direct 
screw-threaded joint; with the glass or plastic models high-pressure tubing of 
suitable bore is wired to the tap and to the pump. 

It is routinely desirable to interpose a large pressure bottle A (Fig. 2.121) 
fitted with a rubber bung between the pump and the apparatus to act as a trap in 
the event of failure of the non-return valve and to serve as a pressure equalising 
reservoir. Connection to the apparatus and to a manometer (see also Fig. 2.124) 
is via a three-way tap B which allows for the release of the vacuum as required; 
the two-way tap C permits the manometer to be isolated from the system when 
necessary. 

Theoretically, an efficient water pump should reduce the pressure in the 
system to a value equal to the vapour pressure of the water at the temperature of 
the water supply mains. In practice this pressure is rarely attained (it is usually 
4-10 mm, or 5.3-13.3 mbar, higher) because of the leakage of air into the appar- 
atus and the higher temperature of the laboratory. The vapour pressure at 5, 10, 
15, 20 and 25 °C is 6.5, 9.2, 12.8, 17.5 and 23.8 mm (or 8.2, 12.3, 17.1, 23.3 and 




Fig. 2.121 



191 



2.29 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



31.7mbar) respectively. It is evident that the 'vacuum' obtained with a water 
pump will vary considerably with the temperature of the water and therefore 
with the season of the year. The water pump vacuum is routinely used for filtra- 
tion, for removal of solvent using a rotary evaporator, and for many distillations 
under reduced pressure. 

OIL IMMERSION PUMPS. 

These now find extensive use in an organic laboratory, either as individual units 
or as a large-capacity unit connected to numerous points in the laboratory 
(satisfactory installation units are supplied by Edwards High Vacuum Ltd). 
Commercially available single-stage pumps may evacuate down to 0.1 mmHg 
(0.133 mbar); somewhat higher pressures are satisfactory for many laboratory 
purposes. To take advantage of the low pressure produced by a good oil pump, 
narrow-bore connections in the apparatus assembly should be avoided by using 
ground glass joints, or 'O'-ring joints if appropriate, wherever possible. Rubber 
tubing connections should be as short as possible. 

For convenience in laboratory use, the pump is mounted on a suitable trolley 
(e.g. that from Gallenkamp), which also houses a vacustat (Section 2.30) and a 
pair of glass vapour traps (Fig. 2.122); these are essential since they protect the 
pump against the intake of moisture or chemical vapours, either of which would 
be harmful to the pumping efficiency if allowed to contaminate the oil of the 
pump. Before the pump is brought into operation therefore, the trapping vessels 
are filled with a suitable coolant (dry ice-acetone). After use the traps must be 
cleaned and dried. If there is a possibility that the vapours are corrosive then it is 
essential that a more elaborate trapping system should be employed. 

VAPOUR DIFFUSION PUMPS. 

To attain pressures lower than that produced by the oil immersion pump, a 
vapour diffusion pump is employed which gives pressures down to 5 x 





Fig. 2.123 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.30 



10~ 6 mmHg(6.6 x 10" 6 mbar). The principles of the operation of a vapour dif- 
fusion pump are illustrated by reference to the schematic diagram shown in Fig. 
2.123. Vapour molecules ascending from the boiler emerge in a downward direc- 
tion through the various orifices sited under baffle plates attached to the central 
tube. Gas molecules diffuse into this descending stream and are thereby pro- 
pelled downwards and removed by a subsidiary backing pump of the oil immer- 
sion rotatory type, after the vaporising fluid has been condensed on the cooled 
jacket which surrounds the unit. The condensed fluid drains into the boiler to be 
revaporised. 

Mercury-charged vapour diffusion pumps, in which the boiler unit is con- 
structed of quartz or Pyrex and designed to be heated with a gas flame or by an 
electric element, are available commercially (e.g. Jencons); the remainder of the 
unit is constructed in Pyrex glass. More robust and highly efficient vapour diffu- 
sion pumps of all-metal construction designed for use with either mercury or 
suitable grades of Apiezon or Silicone oil and electrically heated are also com- 
mercially available. Diffusion pumps, whether of mercury or of oil, when first 
brought into operation do not usually reach their lowest pressure; this will only 
be achieved after continuous operation for 24 hours, during which time dis- 
solved gases, etc., are removed from the fluid, together with occluded gases from 
the glass surfaces. 



2.30 MANOMETERS, VACUSTATS, VACUUM GAUGES AND 
MANOSTATS 

A frequently used simple mercury manometer which is employed for the measure- 
ment of pressure in the range 0.5-17 cm (6.6 to 226 mbar) is the U-tube design 
illustrated in Fig. 2.124 (Anschutz manometer, Gallenkamp). It consists of a 
U-tube charged with mercury and mounted in a wooden stand. The scale B, 
graduated in millimetres and sometimes made of mirror glass in order to elimin- 
ate errors due to parallax, is sited between the two arms and is movable. This

enables adjustment of the scale so that one of the mercury levels coincides with a 
convenient point on the scale, and facilitates the reading of the difference in the 
height of the mercury in the two arms which gives the pressure directly. A tap A 
is usually provided so that the manometer may be isolated from the distillation 
apparatus. Great care should be exercised when using this manometer; if air is 
allowed to enter the exhausted apparatus rapidly when the tap A is open, the 
mercury may rise to the top of the closed end with sufficient velocity to break it. 
It is advisable, therefore, to open tap A only when the pressure needs to be 
measured during an experiment, and at the conclusion of the distillation to open 
the tap very slowly after the pressure in the apparatus has been restored to 
atmospheric. A model is also available (Aldrich) in which the U-tube is totally 
enclosed in a glass chamber to contain the mercury in the case of U-tube break- 
age; in this case the scale is graduated in torr and mbar units. 

The vacustat (Edwards High Vacuum) (Fig. 2.125) is a very useful pressure 
gauge which is usually employed in conjunction with an oil pump; two models 
which cover the ranges 10 to 10" 2 mbar and 1 to 10" 3 mbar are available. It is 
direct reading, compact, and is charged with only about 1 50 g of triple distilled 
mercury. The gauge must be rotated carefully to the vertical position (as shown) 
when reading the pressure; it is then returned to the horizontal position equally 
carefully, otherwise there is a tendency for some of the mercury to spill over into 
the tubing which connects the vacustat to the apparatus via an 'O'-ring glass-to- 
metal adapter (insert A), and hence into the pump (p. 51). The gauge does not 
automatically record a variable pressure. 

The MacLeod gauge (Manostat Corporation), illustrated in Fig. 2.126, is 
widely found in established research laboratories, and is used for the measure- 
ment of pressures down to about 5 x 10" 6 mmHg (6.5 x 10" 6 mbar). The 
gauge, mounted on a suitable stand, is connected to the vacuum system between 
the diffusion pump and the vapour traps (see Fig. 2.113) by means of a ground 
glass joint permanently sealed with Apiezon wax W, or preferably by means of 
an O-ring joint (Section 2.8). The gauge may be isolated from the vacuum 
system by the tap A, Fig. 2.126. The side-arm of the mercury reservoir is con- 
nected via a three-way stopcock B to a suitable auxiliary vacuum system 
(usually the vacuum achieved with a water-jet pump is adequate). 

To take a reading after the gauge has been newly installed, the three-way tap 
B is closed and the gauge is connected to the vacuum system by opening the tap 
A and allowing the mercury to be partially drawn upward into the bulb. The 
three-way tap B connection to the auxiliary vacuum supply is then opened to 
allow the mercury to be drawn down from the bulb. When the gauge and the 
mercury reservoir have been completely evacuated by several such successive 
operations, the gauge is isolated by closing taps A and B. The pressure in the 
system may now be recorded by carrying out the following sequence. The tap A 
is opened carefully, and after a pause of a minute or so to allow the gauge to be 
finally evacuated to the pressure in the remainder of the system, tap B is 
cautiously opened to admit air into the reservoir which allows mercury to rise 
into the bulb. As the mercury approaches the bottom end of the closed capillary 
the three-way tap should be adjusted so that mercury rises at a very slow rate 
until the level in the reference capillary is coincident with the zero on the scale, at 
which point tap B is closed. The pressure reading is now recorded by the level of 
the mercury in the closed capillary. The gauge is then isolated once more by 
closing tap A and the mercury reservoir is evacuated via the three-way tap B to 

194 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.30

withdraw mercury well below the bulb in the gauge. While the bulb-trap at the 
top of the gauge prevents overflow of mercury into the vacuum system it is 
advisable to carry out all the operations needed to record the pressure in the 
system carefully and methodically, since violent 'bumping' in the gauge due to 
the incautious inlet of air could lead to breakage and the hazard associated with 
spilling mercury. Finally it is customary to keep the gauge and reservoir per- 
manently under vacuum. 

The major disadvantage of the MacLeod gauge is the very large quantity of 
mercury that is required (over 3.6 kg). Not only is this expensive but, if the 
apparatus breaks in use or storage, there would be a considerable toxic hazard. 
For these reasons the use of a Pirani or a Penning gauge (Edwards High 
Vacuum) is to be recommended. The former is suitable for pressures in the 
region of 5 to 10~ 3 mbar, and the latter for pressures in the region of 10~ 2 to 
10~ 7 mbar. These gauges operate on the principle that when gas molecules in 
the region of a detector are struck by electrons from a heated filament (the ion 
source), they become electrically charged, and are thus attracted towards a de- 
tector site where they cause an electric current. This current is amplified and 
calibrated to indicate a pressure which is displayed on a meter or by means of a 
digital readout. These gauges may be inserted directly into the vacuum line, as 



195 



2.30 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



discussed for the MacLeod gauge, via ground glass joint adapters or 'O'-ring 
seals. It is essential that these gauges can be isolated from the vacuum line via 
wide-bore stopcocks, which should not be opened to the vacuum line until the 
pressure in the system has been reduced. A stopcock should then only be opened 
when a pressure reading is required otherwise the filament may become un- 
necessarily contaminated. 

The maintenance of a constant pressure in a system during distillation under 
reduced pressure is of great practical importance if steady distillation at con- 
stant temperature is to be achieved, and a trustworthy boiling point recorded. 
Devices which maintain a constant pressure in a system that is higher than the 
minimum pressure that the pump will give are termed manostats. One commer- 
cially available form of instrument is the Cartesian manostat, model 7 (Manostat 
Corporation) (Fig. 2.128). Its operation may be explained with the aid of the 
Fig. 2.127. Mercury is introduced into the container until the disc of the float 
just makes contact with the orifice, when the pressure is equalised inside and 
outside the float. The device is connected to the pump and to the system by way 
of a large reservoir and a manometer. With the stopcock open, the pressure is 
reduced by way of a by-pass between the pump and the system until the desired 
value as read on the manometer is reached, then both the stopcock and by-pass 
are closed; the device will automatically maintain the desired pressure. If the 
system is vacuum-tight, the pressure will maintain itself; a slight leak, which may 
be introduced intentionally, will cause the pressure to rise slightly. This will pro- 
duce a displacement of the mercury level downward outside the float and a 
corresponding displacement upward inside the float; the buoyant force on the 
float is consequently diminished and when this reduction in buoyancy becomes 
sufficient to overcome the suction force at the orifice due to the pressure differen- 
tial, the disc will break away from the orifice and permit the pump to evacuate 
sufficient gas from the system to restore the original pressure. When the original 
pressure is restored, the disc will return to its former position and seal off the 
orifice The cycle is repeated indefinitely if the size of the leak in the system does 
not exceed the capacity of the gas flow that is possible through the orifice and 
the pump is of sufficient rating to carry the load. 

Needle valves (Edwards High Vacuum) are available which provide a fine 
control of a gas bleed into the vacuum line, and are suitable for gas admissions

down to 10" 5 mbar. They may be inserted into the vacuum line; it is further 
recommended that a filter be attached to the inlet of the valve to prevent damage 
from the uptake of dust or grit. 



2.31 CHROMATOGRAPHY 

Chromatography is a separation process which depends on the differential dis- 
tributions of the components of a mixture between a mobile bulk phase and an 
essentially thin film stationary phase. 53-56 The stationary phase may be either 
in the form of a packed column (column chromatography) through which a 
mobile phase is allowed to flow, or in the form of a thin layer adhering to a suit- 
able form of backing material (thin-layer chromatography) over which the 
mobile phase is allowed to ascend by capillary action. 

The thin film stationary phase may be either a liquid or a solid, and the 
mobile phase a liquid or a gas. Possible combinations of these phases then give 
rise to the principal chromatographic techniques in general use. 

In partition chromatography the stationary phase is a thin liquid film 
adsorbed on the surface of an essentially inert support. The mobile phase may be 
either a liquid (liquid-liquid partition chromatography) or a gas (gas-liquid parti- 
tion chromatography or gas chromatography). In either system the separation 
depends largely upon partition between the two phases although the separation 
process may be complicated by the incursion of adsorption effects involving the 
inert support and the compounds undergoing chromatographic separation. 
Paper chromatography is an example of partition chromatography in which filter 
paper serves as a support for the immobile liquid phase. 

In adsorption chromatography the mobile phase is usually a liquid and the 
stationary phase is a finely-divided solid adsorbent (liquid-solid chromato- 
graphy). Separation here depends on the selective adsorption of the components 
of a mixture on the surface of the solid. Separations based on gas-solid 
chromatographic processes are of limited application to organic mixtures. The 
use of ion-exchange resins as the solid phase constitutes a special example of 
liquid-solid chromatography in which electrostatic forces augment the rela- 
tively weak adsorption forces. 

Apart from partition and adsorption processes, chromatographic separations 
may also be based upon differences in molecular size (gel permeation chroma- 
tography, or gel filtration). In this technique gel-like material, which is commer- 
cially available in a range of porosities, serves as the stationary phase, and 
separation is achieved through differential diffusion into the pores of the matrix, 
of molecules which are not large enough to be completely excluded. 

The chromatographic techniques which are principally of use to the synthetic 
organic chemist are described in the following sections. These are: 

1. Thin-layer chromatography (t.l.c). 

2. Liquid-solid column chromatography. 

3. Gas-liquid chromatography (g.l.c). 

4. High performance liquid chromatography (h.p.l.c). 

These techniques may be variously used as analytical tools to establish the com- 
plexity of mixtures and the purity of samples, and as preparative tools for the 
separation of mixtures into individual components. 

197 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The selection of a particular technique which might be expected to be the 
most appropriate for a given situation is to some extent a matter of experience, 
and the following considerations may be used as a guide to assist in the choice of 
method. 

In general preparative work, the chromatographic techniques cited above 
may be used: (a) to establish the purity and authenticity of starting materials and 
(if appropriate) reagents; (b) to monitor the reaction, particularly in the case of 
new reactions, or in the optimisation of experimental conditions to achieve the 
highest possible yield of product; (c) to check the isolation and purification pro- 
cedures; (d) to achieve the separation of product mixtures should this not be 
possible by means of distillation, recrystallisation, or sublimation procedures; 
(e) to provide a further check on the authenticity of the final product in addition 
to that provided by the comparison of physical constants (e.g. m.p., b.p., n't,, 
[a]n, etc.) and spectroscopic data with those quoted in the literature. 

It should be noted of course that with well authenticated preparations, the 
application of chromatographic procedures at the stages noted above would not 
usually be necessary; however, when for some unknown reason the expected 
product is not obtained, or when new reactions are being studied, chromato- 
graphy is invaluable. 

The most convenient and economic techniques of choice for the rapid analy- 
sis of starting materials and for the assessment of purity of a crude reaction 
product are t.l.c. and g.l.c. These techniques may also be used to monitor the 
progress of a reaction for which optimum conditions are uncertain, as may be 
the case when an established published procedure is used as the basis for carry- 
ing out other preparations of a similar nature. In these cases the reaction is moni- 
tored by the periodic removal from the reaction mixture of test portions for 
suitable chromatographic study. Clearly the chromatographic behaviour of 
starting materials and, if possible, expected products, needs to be established 
prior to the commencement of the reaction. For t.l.c. this would include solvent 
and thin layer selection, a detection method, and an appraisal of sensitivity of 
detection with respect to the concentration of components in the reaction 
medium. For g.l.c. preliminary experiments would be required to select a suit- 
able column and the appropriate operating conditions. 

In the case of solid products and starting materials it is often convenient and 
sufficient to load a sequence of appropriately sized samples of the homogeneous 
reaction mixture, taken at various times during the progress of the reaction, 
directly on to a thin-layer chromatographic plate. However the work-up pro- 
cedure of the reaction mixture should be carefully studied to determine whether 
sample pretreatment is required. For example, the product may be present in the 
reaction mixture as an acid or base salt, or as a chelated complex, and the isola- 
tion procedure would then include a step to ensure decomposition to the 
required product. In such a case, sample pretreatment is essentially the opera- 
tion which would be followed in the final work-up procedure (carried out on the 
small scale in test tubes and with Pasteur pipettes) to give a final solution con- 
taining reactants and products for loading on to the t.l.c. plate. 

With liquid reactants and products some simple form of sample pretreatment 
is often essential. This arises from the fact that a g.l.c. column may rapidly 
become contaminated with involatile and possibly highly acidic or basic mater- 
ial which would render it useless within a short period of time. 

By way of illustration the following simple example of a suitable procedure 



198 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



may be cited. In the preparation of an alkyl halide from the alcohol (Expt 5.54) 
using constant boiling hydrobromic acid and sulphuric acid, an aliquot portion 
of the reaction mixture is removed by means of a capillary pipette after a suitable 
time interval from the start of the reaction (say 30 minutes) and transferred to a 
micro test tube. A few drops of ether or dichloromethane are added and the con- 
tents of the tube shaken. The lower organic layer is removed to another micro 
test tube with a capillary pipette and washed successively by shaking it with 
dilute aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and water, the aqueous layers being 
removed with the aid of a pipette. The organic layer is dried by the addition of a 
little magnesium sulphate desiccant, the tube centrifuged if necessary, and a 
sample of the clear upper layer submitted to gas chromatographic investigation. 

When the success or outcome of a reaction is uncertain or unknown, chroma- 
tographic methods are invaluable for assessing the success of the purification 
process. They may well reveal that the procedures adopted are unsuited to the 
required isolation and purification of the reaction product. In these cases the 
chromatographic behaviour of the components in the system which has been 
revealed by these preliminary small-scale studies provides a basis upon which 
purification by preparative chromatographic methods may be achieved. Thin- 
layer chromatographic behaviour may be reasonably closely duplicated by 
employing a similar stationary phase and a similar mobile phase in either a 'wet' 
or a 'dry' column technique, which can then be readily scaled up to accommo- 
date the bulk of the reaction product. Preparative gas chromatography has the 
advantage that usually little further investigational work is required to accom- 
plish the separation of larger quantities, but as will be seen later a preparative 
scale separation may require the use of an automated apparatus using a multiple 
cycling procedure. 

In recent years h.p.l.c. has become a valuable chromatographic tool for 
analytical and preparative scale work. In this latter area the separation of 
isomers (structural, diastereoisomeric, and enantiomeric) has been possible by 
the selection of appropriate column packing material and solvent systems. How- 
ever, the equipment, operating costs, and column packing materials are more ex- 
pensive than those in t.l.c, g.l.c. and conventional liquid-solid column 
chromatography. 

THIN-LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY (t.l.c.) 57 ' 58 

In this technique it is usual to employ glass plates coated with layers of the solid 
stationary phase, which adhere to the plates, generally by virtue of a binding 
agent, such as calcium sulphate, which is incorporated. The prepared thin layer 
on glass is often called a chromaplate. 

The most commonly used stationary phases, which are available in grades 
specially prepared for t.l.c. use, include silica gel, alumina, kieselguhr and cellu- 
lose powder; many of these are available with a fluorescent compound (e.g. zinc 
sulphide) incorporated in order to facilitate the detection of the resolved com- 
ponents of the mixture which is then achieved by viewing the plates under ultra- 
violet light. Other materials suitable for special applications are polyamides, 
modified celluloses with ion exchange properties and the various forms of 
organic gel having molecular sieving properties (e.g. Sephadex, Bio-Gel P). 
Stationary phases for t.l.c. may be obtained from the following suppliers: Aldrich 
Chemical Co., BDH, Eastman Kodak, Fluka AG., Johns-Manville, E. Merck, 
Phase Separations, Sigma Chemical Co., M. Woelm, etc.

2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Preparation of plates. Before glass plates are coated with adsorbent they must 
be carefully cleaned with laboratory detergent, using a test-tube brush to remove 
adhering particles, rinsed thoroughly with distilled water, placed in a suitable 
metal rack and dried in an oven. Subsequent to the treatment with detergent 
solution the plates should only be handled by the edges or by the under-surface 
which is not to be coated with adsorbent. Failure to observe this precaution may 
result in the formation of a mechanically unstable layer which is liable to flaking 
due to grease spots on the glass surface. In severe cases of grease contamination 
it may be necessary to use a chromic acid cleaning mixture (Section 2.2). 

Small plates suitable for preliminary exploration of the chromatographic 
process with regard to the selection of a suitable stationary phase or the selec- 
tion of a solvent system are conveniently prepared from microscope slides using 
a dipping technique; this operation is conducted in a fume cupboard. 

A slurry is prepared by the slow addition with shaking of 30 g of adsorbent 
(most usually silica gel or alumina) to 100 ml of dry dichloromethane contained 
in a wide-necked capped bottle. A pair of microscope slides is held together and 
dipped into the slurry, slowly withdrawn and allowed to drain momentarily 
while held over the bottle. The slides are parted carefully and placed horizon- 
tally in a rack sited in a fume cupboard to dry for approximately 10 minutes. 
The surplus adsorbent is then removed by means of a razor blade drawn down 
the glass edges. It may be desirable to activate the adsorbent further by heating 
it at 1 10 °C; since the activity of the adsorbent varies with the heat treatment and 
the subsequent storage conditions of the prepared plate this further treatment 
should be carefully standardised. For the attainment of a high degree of repro- 
ducibility it is usually best to activate the adsorbent and allow the plate to cool 
in a desiccator cabinet immediately before use. 

Larger single-glass plates (i.e. 20 x 5 cm) may be coated conveniently using 
the easily assembled apparatus shown in Fig. 2.129. It consists of a sheet of plate 
glass (20 x 30 cm) at the upper and lower ends of which two glass plates (20 x 
5 cm) are secured by means of a cement for glass: the plate to be coated is placed 
in the central depression and is held in position by two uncoated plates one on 
either side. The thickness of the layer can be adjusted to the thickness required 
(say 0.25-0.3 mm) by wrapping both ends of a glass rod 14cm long and 7.5 mm 
diameter with equal lengths (12.5 cm) of 2.5 cm Sellotape: this is the 'spreader'. 

The exact composition of a suitable slurry for spreading depends on the 
nature of the adsorbent; this should therefore generally be prepared according to 
the procedure recommended by the supplier. The composition of the slurry may 




EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



have to be varied, as for example in the preparation of buffered silica gel or 
kieselguhr plates, or of plates for reversed phase thin-layer chromatography 
which require coatings of hydrophobic layers. A slurry from about 2 g of dry 
adsorbent is sufficient to coat one plate of the size stated here. The slurry is 
poured on to the upper end of the central glass plate (Fig. 2.129) and spread 
evenly over the plate with the special applicator or spreader: this should be com- 
pleted in 15 seconds. The layer is allowed to stand for 5 minutes in order to set; 
cellulose and polyamide plates are allowed to dry at room temperature and are 
then stored in a dust-free cabinet - they are not normally heated. Inorganic 
adsorbents are activated and stored under standard conditions (see above). 

Figure 2.130 illustrates diagrammatically one form of commercially available 
spreader (Shandon) which consists of a flat frame capable of holding rigidly five 
20 x 20 cm glass plates or the equivalent number of 20 x 10 cm or 20 x 5 cm 
plates. The construction of the frame is such that when the plates have been 
positioned edge to edge the upper surfaces are all aligned in the same plane. This 
flat surface, free from ridges at plate joints, ensures a uniform thickness of 
adsorbent layer over all the plates and provides a smooth path for the metal 
hopper (Fig. 2.131) when drawn across the surface. It is usually best to place at 
either end of the line of plates to be coated a 20 x 5 cm glass plate to provide an 
area upon which the coating process may be started and finished, since fre- 
quently the layer thickness at the immediate start and finishing points is not 
uniform. The prepared slurry is poured evenly into the rectangular well of the 
hopper located on the end plate and this is then drawn steadily over the glass 
plate surface so that the slurry flows evenly through the gap provided on the 
following edge. The thickness of the layer may be preselected by loosening the 
nuts and adjusting the accurately machined metal gate by means of a 'feeler' 
gauge, the hopper resting on a flat glass surface. This enables layers of thickness 
200-2000 nm to be selected; in fact a thickness of 250 nm is usually the most suit- 
able for routine use. When the full capacity of the spreader is to be utilised and 
when thick layers are to be spread, necessitating a fairly large volume of slurry, it 
is sometimes helpful to place a glass rod of suitable length immediately along the 
gap between the glass surface and the metal gate to prevent excessive flow of 
slurry while the hopper is being charged prior to the spreading operation. 

Loading of plates. In order to load the prepared chromoplate (say 20 x 5 cm 
size) with the sample to be investigated the following procedure should be fol- 
lowed; this may be modified appropriately when the larger plates and the micro 
plates are used. Wipe any excess adsorbent from the back and edges of the plate. 





Fig. 2.130 



Fig. 2.131

2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Form a sharp boundary by scoring with a metal scriber parallel with and 5 mm 
from the shorter edge (in the case of 5- and 10-cm-wide plates) of the plate and 
carefully remove surplus adsorbent with the aid of the flat side of a spatula and 
blowing carefully. Align the lower edge of the commercially available template 
(Fig. 2.132(A)) along this edge of adsorbent layer; draw the metal scriber 
through the adsorbent layer using the upper edge (B) of the template as a guide. 
Carefully blow surplus adsorbent from this cut which then provides a finishing 
line for the subsequent solvent front; if not clear of adsorbent the solvent will 
flow unevenly across the line and lead to an unsatisfactory evaluation of the 
chromatogram. With the template still in position, lightly mark a series of start- 
ing points on the adsorbent surface with the metal scriber through the applica- 
tion holes in the template; these are usually located 15 cm from the finishing line. 
(These starting points are 1 cm apart and the design of the template is such that 
four may be symmetrically accommodated on a 5-cm-width plate.) 

In a plastic-stoppered glass sample tube prepare a solution of the mixture to 
be investigated having a concentration in the range 0.5-3.0 per cent by dissolv- 
ing 3mg in from 0.1-0.6 ml of solvent depending on its solubility. The selected 
solvent should be reasonably volatile (e.g. chloroform or light petroleum, b.p. 
40-60 °C); in the subsequent application of a drop of this solution to the adsorb- 
ent rapid evaporation of the solvent is desirable, since this leads to the formation 
of a small-diameter spot which results in a better separation of the components 
in the subsequent chromatographic development process. Similar volumes of 
aqueous solutions give larger spots which result in a more diffuse chromatogram 
- if aqueous solutions need to be used a technique of multiple application (see 
below) may be necessary. Solutions of pure compounds thought to be present in 
the mixture (e.g. starting materials, possible reaction products) are similarly pre- 
pared for application to the adsorbent on the same plate and alongside the mix- 
ture spot - these act as reference compounds to permit more ready 
interpretation of the chromatogram. 

The solutions are applied individually to the marked points on the adsorbent 
layer by means of a sample applicator. This is prepared by drawing out a melt- 
ing point capillary tube in a micro-Bunsen flame and snapping the drawn-out 
portion in two after scratching with the edge of a fragment of unglazed porcelain 
to ensure a clean break. The applicator is charged by dipping the capillary end 
into the solution and after withdrawing, touching the end on a piece of filter 
paper until the volume is reduced to about 0.5 /il. Using the template as a hand 
rest, the solution is transferred to the plate by touching the tip of the capillary on 
to the adsorbent layer, taking care not to disturb the surface unduly. If the 0.5 /il 
volume has been estimated with reasonable accuracy the size of the spot 




EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



should be about 3 mm diameter. Alternatively the use of commercially available 
disposable micro-pipettes which contain standard volumes of from 1 to 5^1 and 
which can easily be partly filled to contain the required amount of solution, or 
the use of calibrated syringes delivering from 0.1 to 5^1, allows the volume of 
solution to be applied to the plate to be judged more accurately. With more 
dilute solutions or where a heavier loading of material is required, larger 
volumes may be applied by allowing the solvent to evaporate during the inter- 
mittent addition of the solution to the plate (the use of a commercial electric 
warm-air blower is recommended) so that the diameter of the spot never exceeds 
3 mm. A suitable cipher is inscribed on the adsorbent layer beyond the finishing 
line and opposite the point of application to identify the nature of the solution 
applied. After use the capillary may be cleaned by dipping it into pure solvent, 
draining by touching the tip on to a filter-paper and repeating the operation two 
or three times. 

Selection of the solvent system. If the chromatographic behaviour of the sub- 
stance under investigation is unknown, the most satisfactory developing solvent 
must be ascertained by preliminary trial runs using micro-plates in 4-oz wide- 
mouthed screw-topped bottles. It is convenient to set up a series of such bottles 
containing solvent systems of increasing polarity. For example, hexane, toluene, 
carbon tetrachloride, dichloromethane, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, 
methanol. Identically loaded micro-plates are developed separately using the 
chosen solvents, dried and sprayed with the appropriate reagent (see below), 
and the chromatographic mobility of the individual components noted. Solvents 
which cause all the components to remain near to the spot origin or to move 
near to the solvent front are clearly unsatisfactory. If it is seen that no single sol- 
vent gives a satisfactory chromatogram, with well-spaced compact spots, it is 
necessary to examine the effect of using mixtures of solvents to provide systems 
having a range of intermediate polarity. For example, mixtures of toluene and 
methanol, or hexane and ethyl acetate, are often suitable when the pure solvents 
are unsatisfactory. 

Development of plates. Individual 20 x 5 cm plates are conveniently developed 
in a cylindrical glass jar (Fig. 2.133) (Shandon). Larger plates, 20 x 10cm and 
20 x 20 cm, require a rectangular glass tank of suitable dimensions such as that 
shown in Fig. 2.134; such a tank can also be used to allow the simultaneous de- 





Fig. 2.133

203 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



velopment of several of the smaller-sized plates. Micro-plates are easily accom- 
modated individually in 4-oz wide-mouthed screw-capped glass bottles. 

Line the inside of the jar with filter paper, leaving a gap for viewing the 
chromaplate. Saturate the filter paper with the selected developing solvent, close 
the jar and allow to stand for about 10 minutes so that the atmosphere in the jar 
becomes saturated with solvent vapour. Insert the plate with the origins spot 
towards the bottom of the jar, tilted as shown, so that the uncoated face is 
uppermost. Carefully pour down the side of the jar more of the developing sol- 
vent so that the bottom of the adsorbent layer is well immersed; the solvent level 
should not however reach as far as the spots. Recap the jar and allow the solvent 
to ascend by capillary action to the finishing line which has been scored across 
the plate. The time required to complete this development varies greatly with the 
composition of the solvent and the nature of the adsorbent. If the system is 
inconveniently slow-running the development process may be terminated before 
the solvent reaches the finishing line, provided that the position of the solvent 
front is marked on the adsorbent layer immediately the plate is removed from the 
development tank. 

After removal, the plate is dried suitably depending upon the volatility and 
toxicity of the solvent system; for example, dry the plate in the fume cupboard (if 
necessary) with a warm-air blower or dry in a temperature-controlled oven, etc. 

Location of spots. The positions of coloured components can of course usually 
be seen without any difficulty providing that the concentration in the initial spot 
is sufficiently high and that excessive spreading of the component during devel- 
opment has not occurred. Viewing the plate under an ultraviolet lamp will 
reveal u.v. fluorescent compounds the positions of which must of course be 
marked with the scriber on the surface of the adsorbent. Non-fluorescent com- 
pounds can be detected by virtue of their fluorescent quenching effect when they 
are chromatographed on adsorbents into which a fluorescent indicator has been 
incorporated (e.g. Silica gel GF254). Routine inspection of plates under ultra- 
violet light is to be recommended before any further detection processes are 
applied. 

A useful general, but unspecific, detecting agent for most organic compounds 
is iodine vapour. The dried plate is allowed to stand in a closed tank containing 
a good supply of iodine crystals scattered over the tank bottom; usually the 
spots are revealed as brown stains. Their positions should be marked as soon as 
the plate has been removed from the iodine tank since standing in air for a short 
while causes the iodine to evaporate and the stains to disappear. 

Another general locating procedure applicable in the main only to plates 
coated with inorganic adsorbents and for the detection of organic material is to 
spray the plate with concentrated sulphuric acid or with a solution of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid (4 ml) in methanol (100 ml), and then to heat the plate in an 
oven to about 200 °C until the organic materials are revealed as dark charred 
spots. Other general spray reagents are potassium permanganate (2%) in an 
aqueous solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate (4%), or, phosphomolybdic 
acid (10%) in ethanol. 

Spray guns (of glass or plastic), operated by compressed air or a rubber bulb- 
type hand blower (e.g. Fig. 2.135) are available from, for example, Bibby Science, 
or Shandon. This spraying operation must of course be carried out with con- 
siderable care and it is advisable to place the plate at the bottom of a large rect- 

204 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



angular glass tank, placed on its side and located in a fume cupboard before 
spraying is attempted. It is also good practice to wear a suitable protective face 
mask. It is essential to cover the plate evenly with spray but without so saturat- 
ing the adsorbent layer that the liquid visibly flows over the surface, since this 
will cause distortion of the zones. 

Chemical methods for the detection of colourless compounds by the use of a 
suitable chromogenic spray reagent are widely used. The most commonly 
required spray reagents are available commercially with spray guns operated by 
an aerosol propellent (e.g. Sigma Chemical Co.). Many of these are selective for 
a particular functional group or groups and may be extremely sensitive; e.g. the 
ninhydrin reagent for the detection of amino acids. Other such spray reagents 
are more general in their application; e.g. indicators may be used in sprays for 
the detection of acids and bases. Such chemical locating agents may be usually 
applied with advantage after successively viewing the plate under ultraviolet 
light, exposing the plate to iodine vapour and allowing the iodine to evaporate. 
This extended treatment gives a much more comprehensive picture of the com- 
position of the mixture of components on the chromatogram than does a single 
non-selective method. 

The selectivity and sensitivity of a wide range of spray formulations may be 
found in the many specialist monographs on thin-layer chromatography. 

Provided that the experimental conditions are reproducible the movement of 
any substance relative to the solvent front in a given chromatographic system is 
constant and characteristic of the substance. The constant is the R F value and is 
denned as: 



Kj 



_ distance moved by substance 
— distance moved by the solvent front 



Figure 2.136 indicates the method of measurement of R F values of each of the 
components of a typical chromatogram: 



R F = 



Kf — IT, Kf — Tr - 



True reproducibility in R F values is however rarely achieved in practice due to 
minor changes in a number of variables such as: 

(a) the particle size of different batches of adsorbent; 

(b) the solvent composition and the degree of saturation of the tank atmo- 
sphere with solvent vapour; 

(c) prior activation and storage conditions of the plates; 

(d) the thickness of adsorbent layer, etc.

2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



It is therefore not desirable to use an R F value in isolation as a criterion of iden- 
tity; marker spots, when reference compounds are available, should always be 
run on the same plate as the mixture to substantiate the identification of the 
components. 

Precoated plates. Glass plates precoated with the most commonly used adsorb- 
ents, with or without fluorescent indicators, can be purchased from the specialist 
suppliers noted above. Having been prepared under carefully standardised con- 
ditions these have a much higher degree of reproducibility in the subsequent 
analysis than hand-coated plates, since some of the factors noted above which 
cause variation in R F values, e.g. particle size, layer thickness, etc., have been 
eliminated. In particular mention should be made of the high performance 
plates (h.p.t.l.c); these are of layers of silica gel having a smaller particle size with 
a narrower particle size distribution, namely in the range 5-10 /an. The chroma- 
tographic resolution and compactness of spots is far superior with these h.p.t.l.c. 
plates. 

Precoated plates are also available for reversed-phase liquid-liquid partition 
thin-layer chromatography. Here the silica gel has been treated with an octadecyl 
silylating reagent thus coating the particles with a non-polar chemically-bonded 
thin film. The solvent employed is more polar than the film and chromato- 
graphic development results from partition between these two phases. 

Reference must also be made to the use of layers precoated on to flexible 
sheets which are also available commercially. The backing material may be 
either of aluminium foil or more usually a solvent-resistant polyester sheet. 
These sheets can be cut to the desired size with a pair of scissors and activated if 
necessary. Several millimetres'- width of adsorbent are then scraped off the sheet, 
on the sides which will be parallel to the direction of solvent flow, using a spatula 
guided by the edge of a steel rule. This step is necessary to prevent a solvent film 
travelling along the edge and in the space created between the adsorbent layer 
and the backing sheet by the scissor cutting. The prepared sheet is then used as 
one would a normal thin-layer glass plate, but it has the added advantage that 
the adsorbent layer is less likely to be accidentally damaged. A further advan- 
tage with these flexible plates is that the developed chromatogram may be stored 
in a notebook, etc., after use. 

Two-dimensional chromatography. When complex mixtures are to be studied, 
the R F values of the individual components may be so close that a clear-cut 
separation of the components is not achieved. In such a case a two-dimensional 
thin-layer chromatographic separation can be used with advantage. 

A single spot of the mixture is applied near to one of the corners of a 20 x 
20 cm plate and the chromatogram developed in one direction as usual. The 
plate is then removed and dried and the chromatogram re-developed in a second 
solvent system so that the direction of solvent flow is at right angles with respect 
to the first (Fig. 2.137(a) and (b)). These illustrations point the need for correctly 
placing the origin spot with respect to the edge of the chromatogram so that the 
solvent levels in both development processes do not cover the applied spot or 
the individual components which separate in the first development. 

It is usual to employ two solvent systems in both of which the individual com- 
ponents have an adequately wide range of R F values since in this way a good 
separation of components over the whole plate is observed. The spot location is 
achieved be means previously described; each component will be characterised 

206 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31

by two R P values. The incorporation of an individually placed marker spot can- 
not of course be applied in the two-dimensional chromatogram. If the chro- 
matographic behaviour of reference compounds under the operating conditions 
needs to be determined, these must be run on a second two-dimensional chro- 
matogram which is developed along with the chromatogram of the unknown 
mixture. 

Preparative thin-layer chromatographic techniques. The simplest form of prepar- 
ative thin-layer chromatography is to use coated plates in which the adsorbent 
thickness is in the range 1-2 mm, although layer thickness up to 4 mm may be 
employed. The sample solution is loaded on to the plate as a continuous streak 
by means of a syringe; there are commercially available applicators which 
enable uniform loading to be achieved. After development in the selected solvent 
system, the dried plate is viewed under u.v. light and the position of the separ- 
ated components (seen as bands across the plate) carefully marked with the 
scriber. The adsorbent layers corresponding to the located bands are then separ- 
ately removed and eluted with a suitable solvent to recover the individual com- 
ponents. A convenient method is to use a glass tube carrying a sintered glass disc 
within its length, one end of which is attached to tubing leading to a water- or 
oil-vacuum pump, and the other end narrowed and shaped to act as a 'vacuum 
cleaner' nozzle. With this arrangement the adsorbent collected then constitutes a 
small chromatographic column which facilitates solvent elution. 

The 'Chromatotron' is a novel and highly convenient piece of equipment for 
preparative thin-layer separations. The equipment was designed by I. and S. 
Harrison (authors of Compendium of Organic Synthetic Methods) and is manu- 
factured and marketed by TC Research. Basically (Fig. 2.138) it consists of a 
slanted circular glass plate which is spun about a central shaft by means of an 
electric motor. The apparatus casing enables the plate to be enclosed in a nitro- 
gen atmosphere, although it may be viewed through the transparent Teflon lid. 
The glass plate carries the adsorbent layer of 1, 2 or 4 mm thickness, and sample 
loading and solvent delivery are via an off-centre inlet. Since the plate is spun 
during loading and solvent development, the sample and separated constituents 
are as radial bands. A continuous, regulated, solvent flow results in eluting sol- 
vent being spun off the edge of the plate and collected via a radial channel to 
drain into an outlet tube. Direct observation with coloured compounds, or ob- 
servation under u.v. light, enables the separated fractions to be easily collected. 
The particular advantages of the equipment are that up to 2 g of a mixture may 
be separated in 5-20 minutes, the nitrogen atmosphere prevents oxidation of 
sensitive compounds, and the adsorbent layers are easy to prepare and in any 
case may be regenerated in situ and reused.

Exercises in thin-layer chromatography. Separation of amino acids. Prepare 
solutions of DL-alanine, L-leucine and L-lysine hydrochloride by dissolving 5 mg 
of each separately in 0.33 ml of distilled water, measured with a graduated 1 ml 
pipette (leucine may require warming to effect solution). Mix one drop of each 
solution to provide a mixture of the three amino acids and dilute the remainder 
of each solution to 1 ml to give solutions of the respective amino acids. The latter 
will contain about 5 fig of each amino acid per (i\. Apply approximately 0.5 fi\ of 
each of the solutions to a Silica Gel G plate and allow to dry in the air (i.e. until 
the spots are no longer visible). 

Prepare the developing solvent by mixing 70 ml of propan-1-ol with 30 ml of 
concentrated aqueous ammonia (d 0.88). Line the inside of the jar with filter 
paper reaching to within 3 cm of the bottom and moisten with the developing 
solvent. Insert the prepared plate into the jar and carefully introduce by means 
of a pipette sufficient of the developing solvent so that the lower edge of the 
adsorbent layer is immersed in the solvent; put the cover in position in the 
mouth of the jar, and allow the chromatogram to develop. 

Remove the chromatogram, dry it at 100 °C for 10 minutes and spray with 
ninhydrin reagent [0.2% solution in butan-1-ol, (1)]; heat at 110°C for 5-10 
minutes in order to develop the colour. Mark the centre of each spot with the 
metal scriber and evaluate and record the R F values. 

Note. (1) Ninhydrin (p. 630) is the 2-hydrate of indane-l,2,3-trione. It reacts with 
a-amino acids to yield highly coloured products. Contact with the skin should be avoided 
since it produces a rather long-lasting purple discoloration. 

Separation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones. The solutions are prepared by dis- 
solving lOmg of each of the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones of acetone, butan-2- 
one and hexan-3-one (or hexan-2-one) in 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate. Prepare a flex- 
ible silica gel sheet of dimensions 20 x 5 cm in the manner already described and 
apply c. 0.5 /il of each of the three solutions to give the marker spots of a dia- 
meter of between 2 and 3 mm. A mixed spot is conveniently obtained by loading 
sequentially to the same area further 0.5 /il aliquot portions of each of the solu- 
tions and allowing the solvent to evaporate completely between each addition.

Charge the paper-lined jar with the developing solvent (toluene: light petro- 
leum b.p. 40-60 °C, 3:1), insert the loaded flexible sheet and allow the develop- 
ment to proceed. Air dry the developed chromatogram and record directly the 
R F values of the components. 

LIQUID-SOLID COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY 

Separations on a preparative scale employing this technique are generally 
accomplished by loading the substance on to a cylindrical column of the solid 
stationary phase, and developing the chromatogram by allowing the liquid 
mobile phase contained in a suitable reservoir to flow through the column under 
gravity, or under pressure applied to the top of the solvent reservoir. 

In the conventional technique, continuous passage of a single eluting solvent 
through the column may eventually result in the emergence from the bottom of 
the column of the individual components of the mixture so that they can be indi- 
vidually collected and recovered. A refinement is progressively to increase the 
polarity of the mobile phase to assist in the displacement of the individual frac- 
tions from the stationary phase and hence to speed up the overall time of opera- 
tion. If, however, actual elution from the column of the components of the 
mixture by such means is impracticable (e.g. because the time required for elu- 
tion is too prolonged), it may be necessary to drain off surplus solvent so that 
the column packing material may be extruded in one piece on to a glass sheet 
and portions of the column cut off and separately extracted and examined. In 
the so-called 'dry-column' technique described below (p. 216 - which differs 
from the conventional technique in details of chromatographic development) 
this column cutting and extraction is the method employed for recovery of 
separated components. 

If the desired compound or compounds are coloured (or strongly fluorescent 
under ultraviolet light), their location on the column or in selected eluent frac- 
tions presents no problems. Hence suitable fractions are combined and concen- 
trated to recover the purified material. 

Colourless compounds in eluate fractions are usually detected by one of the 
following generally applicable procedures: 

1. Provided that the mobile phase is a relatively volatile organic solvent, the 
simplest procedure for assessing the progress of the chromatographic separa- 
tion is to collect the eluate as a series of fractions of equal volume* and to 
evaporate to dryness each fraction in a rotary evaporator and to weigh the 
residues obtained. A graphical plot of weight versus fraction number then 
gives a profile of the chromatographic separation which has been achieved; 
the total weight eluted from the column at any one time should always be 
compared to the amount of mixture loaded on to the column to provide a 
guide to recovery of loaded material. The homogeneity of the residues should 
be further examined by t.l.c. to decide whether any further fractionation is 
required or whether any of the residues contain essentially one and the same 
component and may therefore be combined. 

2. Each of the individual fractions collected could of course be examined directly 
by t.l.c. (using one of the non-selective detecting agents, e.g. iodine vapour), 



* Large numbers of fractions having preselected volumes of between less than 1 ml and 50 or 100 ml 
are most easily collected with the aid of one of the many designs of automatic collectors. 

209 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



but it may be somewhat difficult to estimate the possible concentration of 
material in the eluate, and hence to determine the loading required on the 
chromaplate. Multiple application of some of the individual fractions to the 
same area of the plate may be necessary to detect compounds in relatively 
high dilution. These t.l.c. results will then determine in what manner the frac- 
tions may be combined and if necessary further treated. 

Either of these methods could be expected to cover the majority of cases 
encountered in qualitative or rough quantitative studies applicable to the devel- 
opment of preparatively useful laboratory synthetic procedures. Nevertheless in 
this context the monitoring of a column chromatographic separation by ultra- 
violet spectroscopic methods may frequently be the less tedious method pro- 
vided that certain conditions are met. Firstly the components of the mixture 
should adsorb in the ultraviolet, and the wavelengths used for screening the frac- 
tions should be selected so that all of them are detected. Where measurement of 
the absorption of fractions at a single wavelength is inadequate determination of 
the adsorption at two or more wavelengths should be made. Secondly the 
method is only conveniently used with a single solvent development, and is only 
applicable when solvents which are transparent at the wavelength of ultraviolet 
light selected have been employed for chromatogram development. The refer- 
ence cell will contain the pure solvent and in preparative work aliquot portions 
of the fractions containing components will need to be diluted with pure solvent 
in order to obtain an on-scale absorbance reading. The optical activity of suit- 
able organic compounds may also be exploited for their detection in chromato- 
graphic fractions, particularly in the case of the separation of mixtures of natural 
products. 

In the detection of colourless and non-fluorescent compounds on extruded 
column packing material, the technique of applying a thin streak of a suitable 
test reagent, if appropriate, lengthwise down the extruded column may be used. 
The colours which appear on the surface of the column at the place touched by 
the reagent indicate the positions of the zones; that part of the column packing 
containing colour test reagent can be readily shaved off so that it may be dis- 
carded before the bulk of the material is separated and the component recovered 
by extraction. Alternatively a strip of Sellotape may be placed momentarily 
lengthwise down the extruded column surface; the thin layer so removed is then 
sprayed with the chromogenic reagent and the revealed bands located on the 
main column by suitable alignment. When no such colour test is available the 
extruded column must simply be divided into arbitrary segments, each of which 
must be extracted, the solvent removed by evaporation and the residue exam- 
ined further (i.e. weight, t.l.c). 

The technique of conventional column chromatography. The essential part of the 
apparatus consists of a long narrow glass tube (10-90 cm long and 1-4.8 cm dia- 
meter); these dimensions give columns which hold between from 25 to 400 g of 
column packing material. Figure 2.139 depicts an assembly with one of the 
smaller columns (10-40 cm long and 1-1.8 cm diameter) fitted with ground glass 
joints at its ends to allow for the attachment of a separatory funnel (to act as a 
solvent reservoir) and a Buchner flask via an adapter with tap for the collection 
of the eluate fractions. This design incorporates a sintered glass disc (porosity 0) 
to retain the column packing. Figure 2.140 illustrates the larger chromato- 
graphy column which has ground glass joints fitted to both ends; in use the 

210 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 





Fig. 2.139 



Fig. 2.140 



bottom of the column is closed with a ground glass joint having a sealed sintered 
glass disc incorporated (see insert). This design allows for the column packing to 
be easily extruded. 

When substances which are oxidised by air need to be handled, the separa- 
tory funnel is additionally fitted with a screw-capped adapter with delivery tube 
attached to a suitably controlled supply of an inert gas (e.g. nitrogen - see Fig. 
2.60); additionally the receiver should be a three-necked flask of suitable size, the 
two side joints enabling a flow of inert gas to be passed through the receiver. 

It is not usually desirable in this conventional system to attach a vacuum 
supply to the receiver since this results in tight packing of the column material 
which in turn slows the rate of solvent flow. Application of slight pressure to the 
top of the separatory funnel by means of a cone adapter attached to a suitably 
controlled supply of compressed air is the more satisfactory means of increasing 
the rate of solvent flow. 

Column packing materials. The selection of suitable column packing materials 
(from the suppliers noted above) is made on the basis of the chromatographic 
process which needs to be employed for a particular separation, e.g. adsorption 
or ion-exchange processes or gel nitration. The most widely used and generally 
applied process in preparative chemistry, where the specific need is frequently 
the purification of starting materials (when only impure technical products are 
available) and the complete or partial resolution of components of reaction mix- 
tures, is adsorption chromatography. Chromatographic separation on ion- 
exchange columns is a useful analytical and preparative technique for the resolu- 
tion of mixtures of acids or bases (e.g. amino acids, amino-phenols, etc.) and for 



211 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the isolation of neutral organic material from aqueous solutions containing 
cationic and anionic substances (the technique of 'de-salting', see Expt 5.183 for 
the removal of chloride ion by a resin in the isolation of amino acids). The pro- 
cedures for packing columns in both these groups differ little in principle. Gel 
nitration is an invaluable chromatographic process for the quantitative analysis 
of mixtures of naturally occurring compounds of high molecular weight (e.g. 
proteins, peptides, enzymes, hormones, nucleic acids, etc.) available in small- 
sized samples; its use with these groups of compounds on a preparative scale is 
becoming increasingly important but a discussion of the specialised apparatus 
used and examples of specific applications are outside the terms of reference of 
this volume. 

The most widely used column packing for adsorption chromatography is alu- 
minium oxide (alumina). The particle size of the commercially available grade is 
in the range 50-200 ^m (70-290 mesh) which allows for relatively even packing 
of adsorbent during column packing, for reasonable solvent flow under the force 
of gravity, and for the rapid attainment of equilibrium distribution of the 
adsorbate between the surface of the adsorbent and the mobile liquid phase. 
Alumina may be obtained in basic (pH 10), neutral (pH 7) and acidic (pH 4) 
forms (1), and it is important to ensure that the correct type is employed because 
of catalytically induced reactions which each may cause with particular func- 
tional compounds. For example, basic alumina may lead to hydrolysis of esters, 
acidic alumina may lead to dehydration of alcohols (particularly tertiary alco- 
hols) or may cause isomerisation of carbon-carbon double bonds; in these cir- 
cumstances neutral alumina is to be recommended. The activity of all three 
forms of alumina, which is broadly regarded as relating both to the magnitude of 
the attractive forces between the surface groups on the adsorbent and the mole- 
cules being adsorbed, and to the number of sites at which such attraction takes 
place, is classified into five grades (the Brockmann scale). 59 Grade I is the most 
active (i.e. it retains polar compounds most strongly), and is obtained by heating 
the alumina at about 300-400 °C for several hours. Successively less active 
grades, II- V, are then obtained by the addition of appropriate amounts of water 
(II, 3^%; III, 5-7%; IV, 9-1 1%; V, 15-19%) (2). The activity grade is assessed by 
determining the chromatographic behaviour of specified dyes, loaded in pairs on 
to an alumina column (5 cm long and 1-5 cm diameter) under carefully stan- 
dardised conditions and developing the chromatogram with benzene-light 
petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) (3). By comparing the results with those given in 
Table 2. 1 1 the grade of alumina may be assigned. 

Silica gel (pH 7) may also be graded according to the amount of water added 
to the most active grade, obtained by heating for several hours at temperatures 
not exceeding 300 °C; these are II (5%), III (15%), IV (25%), V (38%). These 
activity gradings are assigned using the same dye pairs as for the grading of 
alumina. 60 Addition of larger amounts of water leads to the formation of a sub- 
stantial film of surface water so that a column prepared from such material may 
be used to effect separations by partition rather than adsorption. 

Less frequently employed adsorbents include magnesium silicate, magnesium 
oxide, magnesium carbonate, calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, calcium 
hydroxide, calcium sulphate, lactose, starch, cellulose and Fuller's earth. Activa- 
tion by drying obviously requires careful control in many of these cases and 
clearly some would be quite unsuitable for separations involving compounds 
possessing certain functional groups. The inorganic adsorbents of this group are

usually obtained as very fine powders and the solvent flow through columns 
prepared from such material is extremely slow; the column performance in this 
respect may be improved by mixing the adsorbent before column preparation 
with diatomaceous earth filter-aids (trade names: Filter-Cel, Super-Cel, Clara- 
Cel, etc.), which have only low adsorbent activity. 

Table 2.12, due largely to Strain, 61 gives a list of adsorbents in increasing 
order of adsorptivity. 

Notes. (1) Neutral alumina may be obtained from the basic form by stirring it with excess 
water and heating to 80 °C; dilute hydrochloric acid is added dropwise with stirring until 

213 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



slightly acid (pH6.5) and the heating maintained for 1 hour. The supernatant liquor is 
decanted and the alumina stirred with aqueous ammonia (2%) at 70-80 °C for 30 
minutes. The alumina is recovered by filtration, washed with distilled water until the fil- 
trate is free of chloride ion and dried at 120°C. 

(2) The deactivation of an adsorbent by the addition of water is achieved by simply mix- 
ing the appropriate quantities in a stoppered flask and shaking in a mechanical shaker for 
about 1 hour to ensure equilibration. 

(3) Prepare two glass columns of approximately 10 cm length from 1.5-cm -diameter glass 
tubing as follows: select a 22 cm length of tubing and heat the mid-section in a broad 
blow-pipe flame (see Section 2.10) until it has softened and thickened. Draw the ends 
apart by about 5 cm to give a constricted portion of about 0.5 cm diameter with walls suf- 
ficiently thick so that when cut into two portions these constricted ends are not fragile; 
anneal both ends of each glass column. Plug the constricted end of one tube with a little 
glass wool, clamp vertically in a retort and add alumina, while at the same time tapping 
the glass tube gently with a wooden rod, to give finally a 5 cm length of adsorbent. Place a 
small conical beaker under the column outlet. Dissolve 5 mg of each of the pair of dyes 
selected in 5 ml of benzene (CAUTION) (warming on a water bath may be necessary) 
and when solution is complete add 20 ml of light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C); fill a 10 ml 
pipette, fitted with a rubber suction bulb, with the dye solution, and with the pipette top 
touching the inner part of the glass column about 1 cm from the adsorbent surface, allow 
the liquid to discharge from the pipette so as not to disturb the adsorbent surface. (It is 
frequently desirable to place a piece of filter paper on to the top of the adsorbent surface 
to prevent it being disturbed by the flow of solution - in this case the pipette may be 
allowed to discharge directly on to the filter-paper cover.) While the solution soaks into 
the column fill a clean 10 ml pipette with eluting solvent (benzene : light petroleum, 1 :4) 
and as the column liquid level just falls to the level of the adsorbent, carefully rinse the 
inside of the glass tube with a few ml of the solvent. When these washings have drained 
into the adsorbent surface add the remainder of the 10 ml portion of developing solvent. 
The chromatogram is assessed when the solvent portion has drained. The operation is 
repeated in precisely the same manner with a fresh alumina column and with another dye 
pair if necessary until the activity grading of the alumina has been established. 

Selection of solvents for adsorption chromatography. The choice of solvent for 
transferring the mixture to be chromatographed to the column will naturally 
depend upon the solubility characteristics of the mixture. If it is already in solu- 
tion, for example as an extract, this is usually evaporated to dryness under 
reduced pressure and the residue dissolved in the minimum volume of the most 
non-polar solvent suitable. As concentrated a solution as possible is desirable to 
achieve a compact band at the top of the column of adsorbent, so that during 
subsequent development the separation will hopefully proceed with formation 
of discrete bands. 

Generally adsorption on to the adsorbent takes place most readily from non- 
polar solvents, such as light petroleum or benzene, and least from more highly 
polar solvents such as esters and alcohols. Frequently the most non-polar sol- 
vent for introducing the mixture on to the column and the initial solvent for 
chromatogram development are the same. Initial adsorption therefore takes 
place rapidly and development may if necessary be accelerated by progressively 
increasing the polarity of the eluting solvent using the 'eluotropic' series given 
below as a guide to sequential solvent selection; all these solvents have suffi- 
ciently low boiling points to permit ready recovery of eluted material: 

Hexane, cyclohexane, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, toluene, 
dichloromethane, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, acetone, propanol, 
ethanol, methanol.

EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



Rather than effecting a sharp change in solvent composition it is usual to in- 
troduce on to the column gradually increasing concentrations of the more polar 
solvent until a complete change has been effected. This may be carried out in 
practice by using successively mixtures of a non-polar and a polar solvent in 
which the proportions of the components are in a ratio of, say, 90: 10, 70:30, 
50 : 50, 30 : 70, 10 : 90, : 100, or by continuously dripping the more polar solvent 
into the reservoir containing the non-polar solvent, which should be fitted with a 
stirring device so that the composition changes gradually. 

The order in which components of a mixture are eluted from a column is 
related to their relative polarty. Thus with a mixture of two components of dif- 
fering polarity, e.g. a hydrocarbon and a ketone, separation is achieved because 
the more polar ketone is adsorbed more strongly on the adsorbent and hence 
the hydrocarbon may be eluted with a relatively non-polar solvent; the ketone is 
then eluted by changing to a more polar solvent. The ease of elution of the 
adsorbate may be broadly in the following order: 

Saturated hydrocarbons &gt; alkenes, alkynes, aromatic hydrocarbons &gt; 
esters, aldehydes and ketones &gt; amines, alcohols, thiols &gt; phenols, carb- 
oxylic acids. 

In a comprehensive study of a mixture having unknown chromatographic 
characteristics it is frequently desirable to be initially guided in the selection of 
adsorbents and solvents from information obtained by t.l.c. analysis using 
alumina or silica gel on microscope slides. Only if these prove unsatisfactory 
would recourse be made to the other adsorbents. 

It should be noted that the resolution obtained on a t.l.c. plate is rather better 
than would be obtained on a conventional adsorption column (see however 
other column techniques below) and hence further trials should be made with 
the various activity grades and with controlled solvent composition changes 
before the bulk of material is submitted to this type of separation. It is in these 
trials that careful attention to the chromatographic profile obtained from suit- 
able analysis of the eluate fractions, and to the total recovery of material from 
the column, is so important. 

Adsorption column preparation and loading. In order to obtain satisfactory re- 
sults, the tube must be uniformly packed with the adsorbent; uneven distribu- 
tion may lead to the formation of cracks and channels and to considerable 
distortion of adsorption band shapes. If there is any doubt concerning the uni- 
formity of particle size of the adsorbent powder it should be sifted before use to 
remove the larger particles; fines are removed from the adsorbent using a sedi- 
mentation procedure immediately prior to column packing. In this the alumina 
or silica gel adsorbent is stirred into between five to ten times its volume of the 
selected solvent or solvent system, allowed to settle for five minutes and the 
supernatant liquor decanted off; the procedure is repeated until the supernatant 
liquid is clear. 

As a rough guide the amount of adsorbent used should normally be 25-50 
times the weight of the material to be separated. A slurry of the adsorbent in the 
solvent (approximately 1 : 10) is poured through a funnel into a clean dry col- 
umn clamped vertically, in a position away from draughts or warm air currents 
from a radiator or electric oven, etc. The adsorbent will settle evenly and free of 
air bubbles if assisted by gentle tapping of the tube with a wooden rod. For 

215 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



packing large columns the slurry is best contained in a separatory funnel and 
stirred with a link-type stirrer while it is allowed to flow into the column. Solvent 
is removed via the tap fitted to the adapter at the column end and more slurry is 
added until the required length of column is obtained. Some workers recom- 
mend that a second column is fitted to the top of the first so that all the slurry 
can be added in one portion thereby yielding a more perfectly uniform column 
of adsorbent on settling. Fresh solvent is allowed to flow through the column 
under the hydrostatic pressure that is envisaged for subsequent chromato- 
graphic development, until no further settling is apparent. At no time during the 
column preparation nor in subsequent use should the level of liquid fall below 
the level of adsorbent. 

The top of the column is frequently covered with a circle of filter paper or a 
layer of clean sand to prevent disturbance of the surface during subsequent load- 
ing. A suitably concentrated solution of the mixture is added from a pipette, the 
liquid is allowed to drain just to the surface of the adsorbent and the inside of the 
tube is rinsed with a small quantity of the solvent which is again allowed to drain 
just on to the column. Finally the column space above the adsorbent is filled 
with solvent and a dropping funnel filled with solvent is attached. 

The subsequent chromatographic development, analysis of fractions and re- 
covery of separated components is as described above. 

The conventional technique just described has been widely used for many 
decades for the successful separation of functional isomers, and a number of 
examples of its use in preparative work are included in the following text. How- 
ever, its drawbacks became very apparent following the observation that the 
resolution of mixtures on t.l.c. plates is far superior using the same adsorbents 
and solvent systems. Furthermore the period of time necessary to complete a 
column chromatogram may be lengthy, and band tailing may reduce the effect- 
iveness of the separation. Three techniques have been developed to overcome 
these difficulties, namely dry-column chromatography, flash chromatography, and 
dry-column flash chromatography. 

Dry-column chromatography. This technique has been developed by Loev and 
Goodman. 62 In this method alumina (100-200 /xm; activity II or III, with incor- 
porated fluorescent indicator) or silica gel (100-250 /xm; activity III, with incor- 
porated fluorescent indicator) (1) is packed dry (using an approximate ratio of 
1 g adsorbate : 300 g of adsorbent) into a glass column (2 to 5 cm diameter) fitted 
with an adapter incorporating a sintered disc (Fig. 2.140) or into nylon tubing (2 
to 5 cm diameter) which has been welded or sealed at the lower end and into 
which a piece of glass wool is then placed. The packing process in the case of a 
glass column is assisted by the use of an ultra-vibrator moved alongside the 
tubing; to fill the nylon tube the bag is filled to about one-third its length and 
then allowed to fall vertically from a distance of a few inches on to the bench 
surface to assist good packing; an ultra-vibrator may be used but it not essential 
and the column obtained is sufficiently rigid to be handled as a filled glass tube. 
During packing and until the chromatogram development is complete the tap in 
the glass assembly is kept open; with the nylon tubing the bottom end is perfor- 
ated by a needle since the packing is retained by the glass wool plug. 

The column may be loaded by the technique of dissolving the liquid or solid 
in the minimum volume of solvent, and by means of a capillary pipette distribut- 
ing this solution evenly on to the top of the column and allowing the solvent to 

216 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



completely drain. An alternative, and indeed preferable, method is to dissolve 
the material to be chromatographed in a suitable volatile solvent (ether, light 
petroleum, dichloromethane) adding column adsorbent equal to about five 
times its weight, and evaporating the solvent. The loaded adsorbent is then 
added to the column top and packed into an even layer. With both techniques 
the column surface is covered with clean, acid-washed sand to a depth of 
between 0.5 and 1 cm. 

The column is developed by gravity flow with a solvent head of between 3 to 
5 cm. This is conveniently achieved by placing the solvent (2) in a dropping 
funnel, closing with a stopper, and with the outlet tube touching the surface 
layer of sand, carefully opening the stopcock. Solvent will slowly escape until the 
drop in pressure in the funnel prevents further flow. The funnel outlet is allowed 
to remain under the level of liquid in the column, since as the level falls air 
bubbles will rise into the funnel and allow further portions of solvent to escape. 
Development is complete when the solvent front reaches the bottom of the col- 
umn (between 15 and 30 minutes). 

Progress of the development is readily observable by viewing the nylon col- 
umns under ultraviolet light which penetrates the nylon covering; the results are 
less satisfactory with glass columns. The column is extruded from the glass as- 
sembly; with the nylon columns the tube is laid horizontally on a sheet of glass 
and the nylon covering slit lengthways with a razor blade. Detection of the zones 
and extraction of the separated components is as described previously (p. 217). 

Notes. ( 1 ) The success of the dry-column technique for the resolution of mixtures is com- 
pletely dependent on the use of the correct activity grade of adsorbent. It should not be 
assumed that the grade purchased is activity I, to which the appropriate amount of water 
could be added (see earlier). It is therefore essential to determine the activity by the use of 
the method previously described, or by using the elegant micro-method described by 
Loev and Goodman in their definitive paper. 

(2) The solvent selected will be that which has proved successful with the trial examina- 
tion on t.l.c. analysis using microscope slides. Preferably this should be a single solvent 
system. If a mixed solvent system is necessary Loev and Goodman suggest that the deac- 
tivated adsorbent should be mixed with about 10 per cent by weight of the solvent system 
and equilibrated by shaking before being used to prepare the dry column. 

Flash chromatography. This technique has been described by W. C. Still et al. 63 
and allows for the rapid separation (10 to 15 minutes) of mixtures of com- 
ponents having AR F values greater or equal to 0.15 and with a sample loading of 
0.01-10.0 g, although the latter is not regarded as being a limiting value. The 
essential features are the use of Silica gel 60, 40-63 ^m (40-230 mesh), in a col- 
umn through which the solvent is passed by the application of positive air pres- 
sure applied to the column head; resolution is sensitive to eluant flow rate, and 
with the solvent mixture ethyl acetate/light petroleum (b.p. 30-60 °C), this is 
2.0 ±0.1 in/minute (50.8 + 2.5 mm). This solvent system is recommended as a 
good general purpose one, although for extremely polar compounds, acetone/ 
light petroleum or acetone/dichloromethane are useful alternatives. 

The apparatus consists of a chromatography column and a flow controller 
(Fig. 2.141). This figure is reproduced from the original literature report, to illus- 
trate the description of the technique below, but the equipment is commercially 
available (e.g. Aldrich Chemical Co., May and Baker Ltd). The flow controller is 
a simple variable bleed device for precise regulation of the elution rate and is 
constructed from a glass/Teflon needle valve. Eluate fractions are collected in

test tubes (20 x 150 mm), and separated components detected by t.l.c. in a 
manner similar to that described above for conventional column chromato- 
graphy. 

The general procedure is as follows. 63 First a low viscosity solvent system (e.g. 
ethyl acetate/light petroleum b.p. 30-60 °C) (1) is found which separates the 
mixture and moves the desired components on analytical t.l.c. to an R F of 0.35 
(2). If several compounds are to be separated which run very close on t.l.c, 
adjust the solvent to put the midpoint between the components at R F 0.35. If the 
compounds are widely separated, adjust the R F of the less mobile component to 
0.35. 

Having chosen the solvent, a column of appropriate diameter (see Table 2.1 3) 
is selected and a small plug of glass wool is placed in the tube connecting the

stopcock to the column body (A). Two telescoping lengths of glass tubing (6 and 
8 mm o.d.) make placement of the glass wool plug easy. Next a smooth 3-mm 
layer of 50-100 mesh sand is added to cover the bottom of the column and dry 
40-63 ^m silica gel is poured into the column in a single portion to give a depth 
of c. 140 mm. With the stopcock open, the column is gently tapped vertically on 
the bench top to pack the gel. Next a 3-mm layer of sand is carefully placed on 
the flat top of the dry silica gel bed and the column is clamped for pressure pack- 
ing and elution. The solvent chosen as above is then poured carefully over the 
sand to fill the column completely. The needle valve (B) of the flow controller is 
opened all the way and the flow controller is fitted tightly to the top of the col- 
umn and secured with strong rubber bands. The main air-line valve leading to 
the flow controller is opened slightly and a finger is placed fairly tightly over the 
bleed-port (C). This will cause the pressure above the adsorbent bed to climb 
rapidly and compress the silica gel as solvent is rapidly forced through the col- 
umn. It is important to maintain the pressure until all the air is expelled and the 
lower part of the column is cool; otherwise the column will fragment and should 
be repacked unless the separation is a trivial one. Particular care is necessary 
with large diameter columns. The pressure is then released and excess eluant is 
forced out of the column above the adsorbent bed by partially blocking the 
bleed port (C). The top of the silica gel column should not be allowed to run dry. 
Next the sample is applied by pipette as a 20-25 per cent solution in the eluant 
to the top of the adsorbent bed and the flow controller is briefly placed on top of 
the column to push all of the sample into the silica gel (3). The solvent used to 
pack the column is ordinarily reused to elute the column. The walls of the col- 
umn are washed down with a few millilitres of fresh eluant, the washings are 
pushed into the gel as before, and the column is carefully filled with eluant so as 
not to disturb the adsorbent bed. The flow controller is finally secured to the col- 
umn and adjusted to cause the surface of the solvent in the column to fall 51 mm/ 
minute. This seems to be the optimum value of the flow rate for most low vis- 
cosity solvents for any diameter with the 40-63 ^m silica gel. Fractions are col- 
lected until all the solvent has been used (see Table 2.13 to estimate the amount 
of solvent and sample size). It is best not to let the column run dry since further 
elution is occasionally necessary. Purified components are identified as 
described above by t.l.c. If the foregoing instructions are followed exactly, there 
is little opportunity for the separation to fail. 

Although fresh columns are used for each separation, the expense of large- 
scale separations makes it advantageous to reuse large diameter columns. Col- 
umn recycling is effected by first flushing (rate = 51 mm/minute) the column 
with approximately 130 mm of the more polar component in the eluant (generally 
ethyl acetate or acetone) and then with 130 mm of the desired eluant. If the eluant 
is relatively non-polar (e.g. ^ 10 per cent ethyl acetate/light petroleum), it may 
be more advantageous to use a flushing solvent (e.g. 20-50 per cent ethyl 
acetate/light petroleum) which is somewhat less polar than the pure high polar- 
ity component. 

Notes. (1) Solvents were distilled prior to use. Thin-layer chromatograms were run on 
glass supported silica gel 60 plates (0.25-mm layer) (E. Mark No. 5765). 

(2) If this R F is given by a solvent having &lt; 2 per cent of the polar component, a slightly 
less polar eluant is desirable. Thus if 1 per cent ethyl acetate/light petroleum gives a com- 
pound an R F of 0.35 on t.l.c, the column is run with 0.5 per cent ethyl acetate. 

(3) If the sample is only partially soluble in the eluantjust enough of the more polar com- 

219 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ponent is added to give complete dissolution. Large quantities of very polar impurities 
are best removed prior to chromatography so that excessive quantities of solvent or large 
increases in solvent polarity will be unnecessary for sample application. 

Dry-column flash chromatography. This technique has been developed from 
flash chromatography by L. M. Harwood. 64 The principal feature is that suction 
is applied to the column packing, and eluting solvents are added in predeter- 
mined volumes with the column being allowed to run dry before the next frac- 
tion is added. Furthermore the apparatus is both simple and of easy operation. 
The general procedure is as follows. 64 The apparatus (Fig. 2.142) is set up for 
filtration using a porosity 3 cylindrical sinter. Table 2.14 gives guidelines for the 
choice of sinter size and amounts of silica, sample and solvent. Columns longer 
than 55 mm are neither practical nor necessary, since reduction in efficiency may 
be observed on large-scale set-ups.

Fill the sinter to the lip with Silica gel 60 (400-230 mesh), and apply suction 
pressing the silica with extra care at the circumference. Still pressing, level the 
surface, tapping the sides of the sinter firmly to obtain a totally level surface and 
a head space for the addition of solvents. 

Under vacuum, pre-elute the column with the least polar combination of the 
required solvents in which the product mixture is readily soluble. If possible, use 
a single least-polar component (e.g. use pentane for pentane/ether gradient elu- 
tion). If the silica has been packed correctly, the solvent front will be seen des- 
cending in a horizontal line. If channelling occurs, suck the column dry and 
repeat the packing procedure. Keep the surface of the silica covered with solvent 

220 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



during the pre-elution until solvent is seen passing into the receiver. Then allow 
the silica to dry under suction. 

Load the sample mixture (dissolved in the minimum amount of the pre- 
elution system) evenly on to the surface of the silica and elute the products by 
adding successive portions of increasing-polarity solvent mixtures, allowing the 
column to be sucked dry after each addition (the silica surface is only slightly 
disturbed on addition of solvent). Generally a solvent gradient whereby the 
more polar component is increased by 5-10 per cent is the most convenient. 
Under these conditions, the product is usually eluted by that solvent mixture in 
which it would have R F 0.5 on t.l.c. For quantities greater than 100 mg, elution is 
often accompanied by frothing on the underside of the sinter. With a little ex- 
perience, separations of the same efficiency as t.l.c. are easily possible. There is 
minimal material loss and the technique is economical in time and solvents. 

During prolonged chromatography with volatile solvents, atmospheric mois- 
ture may condense on the apparatus; although this does not affect the efficiency 
of the separation, it may be diminished by substituting less volatile solvents (e.g. 
hexane for pentane). No solvent is particularly disfavoured for this technique 
but combinations of pentane (hexane), ether, ethyl acetate and methanol are 
adequate for most separations. Low diffusion of the product bands during chro- 
matography usually means that each component is eluted in one or two frac- 
tions, resulting in minimal loss of product in cross-contaminated fractions. 

Exercises in conventional column adsorption chromatography. Purification of 
anthracene. Dissolve, with warming if necessary, 50 mg of crude anthracene 
(usually yellowish in colour) in 50 ml of hexane. Prepare a 20 cm column of 
activated alumina using a slurry containing 50 g of activated alumina (Grade II) 
in hexane in a glass chromatographic column of 1.8 cm diameter and 40 cm 
length fitted with a sintered disc, adapter with tap and separatory funnel. Add 
the anthracene solution to the top of the column from a separatory funnel, rinse 
the funnel with a little hexane and then develop the chromatogram with 200 ml 
of hexane. Examine the column from time to time in the light of an ultraviolet 
lamp (Section 2.3.6, p. 52). A narrow, deep blue fluorescent zone (due to carba- 
zole) will be observed near the top of the column; the next zone down the col- 
umn is a yellow non-fluorescent zone due to naphthacene, the intensity of which 
will depend upon the purity of the sample of anthracene used. The anthracene 
forms a broad, blue- violet fluorescent zone in the lower part of the column. Con- 
tinue to develop the chromatogram until the anthracene begins to emerge from 
the column, reject the first runnings since these contain the less strongly 
adsorbed paraffin-like impurities and change to a clean receiver. Continue to 
elute the column with hexane until the removal of the anthracene is complete (1); 
the yellow zone should not reach to the bottom of the column. Concentrate the 
eluate fraction containing the anthracene under reduced pressure on a rotary 
evaporator to about 2 ml, cool the flask in an ice-salt bath and by means of ice- 
cold hexane quantitatively transfer the crystals and solution to a filter funnel. 
Wash the pure anthracene crystals with chilled hexane; the product (30 mg), 
which is fluorescent in daylight, has m.p. 215-216 °C. 

Note. ( 1 ) When the anthracene band begins to emerge from the bottom of the column its 
elution may be accelerated by changing to a mixture of hexane : benzene (1:1) 
(CAUTION). In this case the fractions containing the anthracene are evaporated to dry- 
ness under reduced pressure and then redissolved in hexane and concentrated to low bulk

as described in the main text. This additional operation is necessary owing to the solubil- 
ity of anthracene in benzene.

Place a mixture of 1.0 g of purified cholesterol and 0.2 g of copper(n) oxide in a

place the air by carbon dioxide and insert a plug of cotton wool in the mouth of 
the tube. Heat in a metal bath at 300-315 °C for 15 minutes and allow to cool; 
rotate the test tube occasionally in order to spread the melt on the sides. Warm 
the cold residue with a few ml of benzene and pour the black suspension directly 
into the top of a previously prepared chromatographic column (1); rinse the test 
tube with a little more benzene and pour the rinsings into the column. With the 
aid of slight pressure (c. 3-4 cm of mercury), allow the solution to drain into the 
alumina column; stir the top 0.5 cm or so with a stout copper wire at frequent 
intervals to prevent blockage by the finely divided copper compounds. When all 
the black liquid has run in, there should be free flow without the necessity of 
further stirring. Continue the development with benzene until a distinctly 
yellowish diffuse zone approaches the bottom of the column; some 150 ml of 
liquid will have been collected. Now collect 5 ml fractions until the yellow band 
is completely removed. Evaporate each of these fractions separately; the earlier 
ones yield oils (giving a yellow 2 : 4-dinitrophenylhydrazone) and the later ones 
will crystallise upon rubbing (cholestenone). Continue the elution with a further 
400 ml of benzene; the latter upon evaporation yields most of the cholestenone. 
Isolate the remaining cholestenone by continuing the elution with benzene con- 
taining 0.5 per cent of absolute ethanol until a dark brown band approaches the 
bottom of the column. Collect all the crystalline residues with the aid of a little 
light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C, into a small flask and remove the solvent. Dis- 
solve the residue in 40-50 ml of hot methanol, add 0.2 g of decolourising carbon, 
filter through a small bed of alumina (6 mm x 6 mm), concentrate to about 
20 ml and leave to crystallise overnight. The yield of cholestenone, m.p. 82 °C, is 
0.5 g. 

Note. (1) Prepare the column for chromatography by mixing 90 g of chromatographic 
alumina (Spence) with sufficient benzene to form a thin slurry when stirred. Pour this, 
stirring briskly, into a tube (40 cm long and 18 mm internal diameter) having a sintered 
glass disc, and rinse with a little more benzene. An even packed column, about 35 cm 
long, should result. Allow to drain until the supernatant benzene is within 1 cm of the alu- 
mina before adding the solution to be chromatographed. Under no circumstances should 
the column be allowed to drain so that the liquid level falls below that of the alumina. 



* The experimental details were kindly supplied by Professor D. H. R. Barton, F.R.S. and Dr W. 
Rigby; because of the toxicity of benzene this chromatographic column should be set up in the fume

Dissolve 1.0 g of azobenzene [Expt 6.90; this is the (£)-form] in 50 ml of light

in the beaker. Meanwhile prepare a chromatographic column from 50 g of acti- 
vated acid alumina (Grade I) as a slurry in light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C, to give 
a column of approximate dimensions 20 cm x 1.8 cm. After the column has been 
formed in this way, place a well-fitting filter paper at the top of the column and 
pour the solution, immediately after it has been irradiated, slowly down a glass 
rod on to the filter paper until the column is filled with liquid; take great care not 
to disturb the upper portion of the column. Develop the chromatogram with 
100 ml of light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C. A sharp coloured band [(Z)-form], 
c. 2 cm in length, makes its appearance at the top of the column while a diffuse 
coloured region [containing the (£)-form] moves down the column. The upper 
portion of the column should be screened from light by wrapping it with black 
paper, held in position by a rubber band, during the development process; this 
will largely prevent the reconversion of the (Z)- into the (£)-form. Extrude the 
column and remove the coloured 2 cm band from the column and shake it with 
150 ml of light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C, containing 1.5 ml of absolute methanol 
(1); filter off the alumina, with suction, and wash the nitrate with two 15 ml por- 
tions of water to remove the methanol present. Dry the light petroleum extract 
by shaking it with about 1 g of anhydrous sodium sulphate for 10 minutes, filter 
and evaporate the solvent under reduced pressure. The residual coloured solid, 
m.p. 71.5 °C, is practically pure (Z)-azobenzene. Its individuality and its purity 
may be confirmed by recording the ultraviolet absorption spectrum in ethanol 
solution as soon as possible after its isolation; (Z)-azobenzene has /l max 281 nm, 
e 5260, (£)-azobenzene has l maj! 320 nm, e 21 300 in ethanol solution. 

Note. (1 ) Alternatively the (Z)-isomer may be removed from the column by changing the 
eluting solvent to one of light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C, containing 1 per cent of metha- 
nol. The eluate fraction is then washed with water to remove the methanol in the manner 
described in the main text. 

GAS-LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (g.l.c.) 

Providing the components are adequately volatile gas-liquid chromatography 
(g.l.c.) is perhaps the most powerful technique for the rapid and convenient anal- 
ysis of the composition of mixtures of organic compounds. 65,66 It is based upon 
the partition of components between a mobile gas phase and a stationary liquid 
phase retained as a surface layer on a suitable solid supporting medium. 

The basic design of instrument is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2.143 and 
consists of a metal or glass column approximately 2-3 m in length and 2-4 mm 
internal diameter, which is in the form of a circular spiral of three or four turns, 
and packed with supporting medium impregnated with a stationary phase; the 
column is located in a temperature controlled oven. The mobile gas phase

(usually but not necessarily nitrogen) enters the column at one end, which also 
incorporates an injection port for the introduction of the sample. The com- 
ponents of the sample are carried down the column, separation being dependent 
upon their individual partition coefficients between the stationary and the 
mobile phase, and emerge in turn into a detector system which is attached to the 
column end. The signal from the detector is suitably amplified and fed into a pen 
recorder. The qualitative (and if necessary the quantitative) composition of the 
mixture is assessed from an examination of the graphical traces so produced. 

A simple, but typical chromatogram (Fig. 2.144) for a homologous mixture of 
ketones illustrates the powerful nature of this analytical tool. The chromato- 
graphic behaviour of each component of a mixture under a given set of experi- 
mental conditions is usually recorded in terms of its retention time (t R ). This 
represents the time required for the component to emerge from the column after 
injection. On the older-type instruments this is evaluated by measuring the dis- 
tance on the pen recorder chart paper from the point of injection to the centre of 
the peak and dividing this by the chart speed. A point to note from this trace is 
that an increase in retention times leads in general to a broadening of the peaks. 
From a practical point of view this fact is of value in the interpretation of chro- 
matograms of mixtures having an unknown number of components. If insuffi- 
cient time has been allowed for the slowest running component to emerge and a 
second injection is made, the appearance of a peak which is anomalously broad 
in relation to its retention time strongly suggests that it represents a slow run- 
ning component from a previous injection. 

Provided that the detector is equally sensitive to each of the components of 
the mixture, and that therefore the ratio of peak areas is equal to the ratio of 
weights of components in the mixture (a reasonable assumption when com-

pounds of the same functional type are being studied), and provided that all the 
components are volatile and have been eluted, the percentage of each com- 
ponent can be determined by measuring the area under each peak and express- 
ing this as a proportion of the total area. 

Thus, for a two-component mixture (A + B): 

„ . area of peak A 

Per cent A = — ™ — — - x 100, etc. 

area of [peak A + peak B] 

If standard mixtures of known weight ratios of components do not give the same 
ratio of areas, the detector is not responding equivalently to each component. In 
this case a quantitative analysis of the mixture requires preliminary experi- 
mentation. One method is the use of an internal standard (for a more detailed 
discussion of other procedures, specialist texts should be consulted 65 ' 66 ). Thus 
for a two-component mixture (A + B), a third component C is selected as the 
internal standard. Mixtures of A + C and B + C are prepared in which the 
weights of each component in each mixture are known. The relevant chromato- 
gram is recorded and the detector response factors calculated from the following 
relationships: 

area of A wtofA area of A x wt ofC 

77- = t f ^ ' •"• w t of A = — 

area of C wt of C area of C 

or 



wt of A = response factor (A/C) x wt of C; 



similary for B. 

Known weights of C with the mixture (A + B) are mixed, the chromatogram 
recorded, the areas of all three peaks measured, and the areas of A and B con- 
verted into weights by use of the response factors, from which the percentages of 
A and B may be calculated. 

The success of the analysis is dependent on the selection of a suitable internal 
standard. Some important criteria for such selection are as follows: (a) that it is 
not chemically reactive towards any of the components of the mixture; (b) that it 
has a retention time which gives a base line separation from the other com- 
ponents, including any impurities; (c) that the retention time is comparable with 
that of the components of the mixture; (d) that the peak profile is symmetrical 
and therefore does not exhibit either 'fronting' or 'tailing'; and (e) that the de- 
tector response to the internal standard is such that neither an excessive, nor a 
minute, weight of standard compared to the weight of mixture needs to be used. 

Mention must be made of the use of an internal standard to monitor a reac- 
tion by g.l.c. analysis, and also to calculate the g.l.c. yield. Here, a known weight 
of the standard, inert to the reaction conditions and conforming to the other cri- 
teria of selection noted above, is added initially to the reaction mixture. In the 
case where samples of the mixture can be removed and loaded directly on to the 
column, the subsequent analysis presents no problem and may be deduced from 
the discussion above. In the case of samples which require evaporation of sol- 
vent prior to chromatographic examination, it is only necessary to ensure that 
the standard, and indeed the components to be analysed, do not volatilise under 
the conditions of concentration. If the samples require more involved solvent 
extraction procedures, then further experimentation is required to establish that 

225 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the internal standard and the components are being equally and efficiently re- 
covered. 

The present generation of gas-liquid chromatographic instruments have 
many important design features, and the manufacturers' literature should be 
consulted for precise details (e.g. from Perkin-Elmer, Philips Analytical, Varian 
Associates, Waters Chromatography Division). However, some key features 
may be summarised briefly: (a) an oven design for subambient, isothermal, or 
temperature programming operations, which may be selected via a software key 
user interaction; (b) a versatile injection system for liquid or gas samples, suit- 
able for packed columns or for capillary columns - these latter require what is 
termed a split/splitless injector with automatic vent control to allow only a 
minute sample to be loaded on to this type of column 67 ; (c) a wide range of inter- 
changeable detectors including flame ionisation, thermal conductivity, electron 
capture, and specific detectors for nitrogen, phosphorus and sulphur-containing 
compounds; (d) a video display unit recording all the parameters of the chroma- 
tographic run, and data handling software for specifying retention times and for 
the calculation of peak areas and detector responses; and (e) finally, interfacing 
with, for example, a Fourier Transform infrared spectrophotometer 68 or a mass 
spectrometer - in these cases identification of the components of the mixture 
may be by visual comparison with standard spectra, or by automatic searching 
with an appropriate database. 

The examples of the use of g.l.c. in the preparative sections of this text employ 
the conventional packed columns, and provide the undergraduate with the 
opportunity of becoming familiar with the technique. The most usual solid 
support material is kieselguhr which is available from commercial suppliers in 
various standard particle sizes. Pretreated grades are available which either 
have been acid washed to remove acid-soluble materials from the support sur- 
face, or have been both acid and base washed to remove additionally any acidic 
organic contaminants. The polar character of the support material, which is due 
to the presence of surface hydroxyl groups, may be modified by treatment with 
dimethyldichlorosilane. Examples of two other types of support materials, 
namely GC Porasil and Poropak, are available from Waters, although other 
manufacturers market their own proprietary products. The former material is a 
spherical silica packing of controlled pore- volume and surface area. This pack- 
ing material may be used either with or without a stationary phase. The other is 
a polymeric ethylvinyl-divinylbenzene which is available in a range of modified 
structures and may be used as column packing directly without the need for a 
stationary phase. Capillary columns are of fused silica, usually in lengths of 15, 
25 or 50 m and of 0.20 or 0.32 mm internal diameter. The stationary phase is 
either adsorbed on to the inside surface, giving a layer thickness of 0.20 //m (e.g. 
Flexica columns, Pierce Chemical Co.), or chemically bonded on to the inside 
surface (e.g. Flexibond columns, Pierce Chemical Co.). The latter have a longer 
life, since they may be rinsed and reconditioned at appropriate intervals. Sta- 
tionary phases of different polarities are available and this, coupled with the 
high efficiency (resolution) of the capillary system, makes these columns of very 
great value in routine analytical laboratories. 

The choice of stationary phase will be influenced by the polar character of the 
components of the mixture. In general, mixtures with components of high polar- 
ity separate better on chromatography when the more polar stationary phases 
are used. The chromatographic separation of a mixture is judged to be successful 



226 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



if the peaks are well separated (i.e. good resolution) and the peak shape is sym- 
metrical and lacking in extensive trailing. The oven temperature has to be 
related to the overall volatility of the components and this in turn also influences 
the choice of the stationary phase; for example, it would be useless to endeavour 
to separate a mixture of high boiling compounds on a column with a stationary 
phase of low thermal stability. 

The range of stationary phases which is now available commercially is very 
extensive and offers an adequate choice of polar character and thermal stability. 
Table 2.15 lists some of the more generally useful stationary phases, their maxi- 
mum operating temperatures and the classes of compounds for which satisfac- 
tory separations have most usually been found. 

It is frequently desirable when assessing the purity of new compounds or 
evaluating the complexity of liquid mixtures to observe the chromatographic 
behaviour on more than one type of column-packing material, since rarely will 
two compounds have identical retention times on two substantially different 
types of stationary phases.

While the resolution obtainable for a given mixture is largely determined by 
the nature of the stationary phase, the length of the column, and the efficiency of 
the column packing process, some modifications to the appearance of the final 
chromatogram to enable a better evaluation of retention times and peak areas (if 
this is being done by the operator rather than by the software of the instrument) 
may be achieved by certain simple operations. The best resolution that a par- 
ticular column is capable of achieving may only be realised with the lowest 
sample loading, e.g. of the order of 0.1 /il with conventional packed columns; it is 
for this reason that capillary columns which operate with a fraction of this 
amount are so efficient. Lowering the temperature of the column increases the 
retention times of all components and may make marginal improvements to the 
resolution of the peaks; this delayed emergence of components leads to broader 
peaks and this in turn may simplify the calculation of peak areas if these are 



227 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



being measured by the operator. Reduction of the flow rate of gas also causes an 
increase in retention time. The present generation of instruments have asso- 
ciated software as a means to attenuate peaks and make base-line corrections. 
They also incorporate temperature programming which enables the more vola- 
tile components of a mixture to be eluted with good resolution at an appropriate 
low initial column temperature; the column temperature is then raised at a pre- 
determined rate to a higher level to allow the less volatile components to be 
eluted more quickly. The chromatogram profile obtained in this way is superior 
to that obtained at constant temperature (i.e. isothermally). 

A provisional identification of the components of the mixture may be made 
from a comparison of the retention times with those obtained for the pure com- 
ponents, if available (e.g. a solvent or reactant used in the original preparation, 
etc.). Identification must however be confirmed by careful co-chromatography 
of the mixture with each of the suspected components, added in turn. An 
enhancement of the appropriate peak will confirm the presence in the mixture of 
the added component. It must be emphasised that the amount of reference com- 
pound added should be related to the amount suspected to be present in the 
mixture, and that several separate additions of say 20, 50 and 100 per cent 
should be planned. If care is not taken in this way the peak corresponding to a 
trace component whose identity is required may be swamped by that of an 
added reference compound and its identification made unreliable. Figure 
2A45(a)-(e) illustrates a sequence of results which might be expected to arise 
from adding increasing amounts of component B to the mixture, consisting of a 
major component A with a trace impurity, the original chromatogram of which 
is shown in (a); (b) and (c) are chromatograms which could be expected on the 
addition of compound B, the suspected trace impurity, in 50 and 100 per cent of 
the amount of trace component, and the fact that the peak enhancement is pro- 
portional to the added component confirms that the trace component is in fact 
B; had B not been identical with the trace component, addition may have given a 
chromatogram such as (d) revealing the separation of the trace component from 
the added component B. The effect of adding too great a proportion of B is illus- 
trated in (e), where it is clear that it cannot be established that the coincidence of 
the peaks of the trace impurity and the added reference compound B is exact. 

Compounds which are not sufficiently volatile to be analysed directly by the 
g.l.c. technique, may often be converted into a volatile compound by some suit- 
able derivatisation process. Although the conversion of polar functional groups 
(e.g. OH, SH, NH 2 , NH, C0 2 H) into the corresponding ethers, esters, or 




EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



iV-alkyl and N-acyl derivatives has been widely used, the method of choice is 
that of trimethylsilylation. The procedure is widely applicable to natural prod- 
ucts (e.g. carbohydrates, amino acids, steriods, alkaloids, polyhydroxyphenols, 
fatty acids, etc.), and has found great use in analytical and preparative laborat- 
ories which handle such compounds. 

Among the more important trimethylsilylation reagents are: trimethylchloro- 
silane (TMCS); hexamethyldisilazane [(Me 3 Si) 2 NH, (HMDS)]; iV-trimethyl- 
silylimidazole (TMSI) (1); iV,0-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) (2); 
iV,0-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifiuoroacetamide (BSTFA) (3); and iV-methyl-iV-(t- 
butyldimethylsilyl)trifiuoroacetamide (MTBSTFA) (4).

These reagents in the presence of a solvent (such as pyridine, acetonitrile, 
dimethylformamide) rapidly effect trimethylsilylation, often at room temperat- 
ure, of hydroxyl, amino, imino, amido, thiol and carboxyl groups whether in 
mono- or polyfunctional compounds. Frequently a sample of the reaction mix- 
ture may be loaded directly on to the g.l.c. column, although in some cases re- 
moval of the small amount of solvent which is present may improve subsequent 
analysis of the chromatographic trace. Proprietary reagent formulations are 
available from Pierce Chemical Co., pioneers in this field and publishers of 
detailed procedures suited to particular groups of compounds. 

The exercise described below, which has been used in the editors' laboratory, 
is illustrative of the analysis of monosaccharides as their trimethylsilyl deriva- 
tives formed in pyridine with a mixture of TMCS and HMDS. It should be 
noted with this method that most aldoses give two peaks corresponding to a 
mixture of anomeric derivatives, and ketoses give additional peaks which are 
thought to correspond to derivatives having different ring sizes. This problem 
may be largely overcome by the use of TMSI in pyridine as the silylating 
reagent. Comprehensive reviews have been published on the silylation of 
organic compounds and on other suitable derivatisation procedures for use in 
g.l.c. analysis. 69 ' 70 

Preparative gas chromatography. The purified fractions from a gas chromato- 
graphic column can in principle be collected by interposing between the column 
end and the detector a splitting device which diverts most of the effluent through 
suitably cooled traps in which the components are individually condensed. The 
microlitre sample injection employed in a conventional analytical chromato- 
gram does not of course yield useful amounts of purified components. However, 
with the aid of longer columns (2, 4.5 or 9 m) of a somewhat larger diameter 
(c. 1cm), larger sample loads (20-100^1) and an automatic repeating cycle of 
sample injections, a truly preparative scale separation of components may be 
achieved.

Exercises in gas chromatography. In most laboratories which routinely use the 
gas chromatographic technique, a range of columns packed with a selection of 
stationary phases on appropriate support material will of course be available^ 
Furthermore the range and sophistication of the available instruments is now 
very wide, each having particular merits in relation to the nature of the work 
being carried out. The following two exercises may therefore be regarded as only 
an introduction to some of the principal practical features of the tedinique 
including column preparation, qualitative and quantative analysis, and an 
example of derivatisation, as applied to monosaccharides. 

Analysis of a mixture of ketones, (a) Qualitative analysis. The following instruc- 
tions for the packing of a standard 1.5-m length, 4-mm diameter glass column 
with a 10 per cent dinonyl phthalate on Chromosorb W support can be taken as 
indicative of the general technique appropriate to the packing of a column. 

Dissolve 1.5 g of dinonyl phthalate in 40 ml of acetone in a 250 ml round- 
bottomed flask and add 13.5 g of Chromosorb W, mesh 60/80, slowly and with 
swirling. Allow the mixture to stand for 2 hours with occasional gentle agitation, 
remove the solvent on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure and finally 
heat the residue at 100°C on a water bath for 1 hour under water-pump 
vacuum. Insert a plug of glass wool into the end of the shorter glass limb of the 
column and fit the metal connector. Attach the metal connector to a vacuum 
line and apply suction to compress the plug. Support the column in a suitable 
clamp and connect a glass funnel with a piece of rubber tubing to the longer 
glass limb which is held vertically. With the vacuum applied, pour successive 
small portions of the column-packing material into the column via the funnel 
and tap the glass spiral with a wooden rod to assist packing. When the column is 
full to within 5.5 cm from the open end, remove the funnel and insert a plug of 
glass wool to retain the packing. Condition the column for use by heating it for 
24 hours in an oven held at 1 10 °C while a steady stream of nitrogen is passed 
through (1). 

Fit two similarly prepared columns into the instrument according to the 
manufacturer's instructions and adjust the controls so that an oven temperature 
of 80 °C and a flow rate of 40 ml/min of the carrier gas is maintained. With the 
attenuator control of the instrument set at a relatively high value (say, 20 x 10 4 , 
which represents a fairly low sensitivity) and with the recorder switched on, pre- 
pare to load the front column with a 1 /d sample of acetone in the following way. 
Insert the needle of a 1 ^1 micro-syringe into a sample of acetone, and withdraw 
the plunger to beyond the 1 /il calibrated mark. Remove the syringe and adjust 
the plunger lead to the mark, wipe the outside of the needle with paper tissue 
and insert the full needle length into the column via the injection port - some 
resistance will be felt during passage through the rubber septum. Simultaneously 
with the injection, activate the pen recorder by operating the jet polarity switch 
on the amplifier to indicate the injection time. After a few seconds' pause remove 
the syringe needle and evaporate residual acetone by operating the plunger a few 
times. Both during insertion and withdrawal of the needle some support should 
be given to it with the finger to prevent damage by bending. 

Observe the peak obtained and estimate any necessary adjustments to the 
sensitivity controls to modify its size so that its maximum is between one-half 
and three-quarters of the chart paper width. Check this adjustment by injecting 
a further 1 /il sample and then repeat until a reproducible peak is obtained. 

230 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



Finally increase the sensitivity setting by a factor of 10 and reduce the injection 
volume to 0.1 ^1 - similarly check the reproducibility of this injection by repeat- 
ing several times (2). 

Notes. (1) With columns having other stationary phases the temperature of the column 
conditioning process is usually 10-15 °C above that of the temperature at which the col- 
umn will be subsequently operated; it should not exceed the temperature limit value 
quoted in Table 2.15 (p. 227). 

(2) If difficulty is experienced in achieving the required reproducibility it is possible that 
the injection septum is leaking, thus allowing some of the injected sample to escape - a 
variation in retention times may also be noticed as a result of leakage of carrier gas. The 
septum should be replaced. Unreproducible results may also be due to leakage around 
the syringe plunger. 

Inject 0. 1 /il samples of each of the following straight chain aliphatic ketones; 
butan-2-one, pentan-3-one, pentan-2-one and heptan-3-one. After each injection 
clean the syringe by filling it with acetone and expelling the latter several times 
and finally evaporating the residual acetone as before. 

Plot a graph of logi tu against the molecular weight or alternatively the car- 
bon number (i.e. the number of carbon atoms in the molecule) of the ketone. 
Estimate the retention time of a ketone containing six carbon atoms and check 
your result by a suitable injection. Finally examine the chromatographic 
behaviour of 3-methylbutan-2-one, 4-methylpentan-2-one and 5-methylhexan- 
2-one. 

(b) Quantitative analysis. Prepare a standard series of mixtures of pentan-2-one 
and heptan-3-one having the approximate composition 20:80, 50:50 and 
75:25, w/w, by weighing accurately appropriate quantities into a semimicro 
tube. 

Inject successively and in duplicate 0. 1 /il samples of each of the mixtures into 
the column and record the chromatographic traces. Determine the areas under 
the peaks by both of the following procedures and compare the results with 
those given by the instrument software, if fitted. 

1 . Measure the heights of each peak from the extrapolated base line, and the 
width of the peak at half peak height; the approximate area is the product of 
these two values. 

2. Trace each peak carefully on to another sheet of paper, cut out and weigh the 
area enclosed between the trace and the base line. 

Using the relationships noted previously (p. 224) establish that there is an 
equal response by the detector to each component. 

Inject a 0.1 ^1 sample of a given pentan-2-one and heptan-3-one mixture, 
measure the area of each peak and calculate the percentage composition as 
noted above. 

Analysis of a monosaccharide. Prepare a column packing using acid-washed, 
silanised Chromosorb W as the solid support and a stationary phase (5%) of 
either Silicone GE-SE52 or OV17. These have a temperature tolerance of up to 
300 °C, and are therefore also suitable for oligosaccharide analyses. A stationary 
phase of ethylene glycol succinate ester (EGS) may be used if trie maximum tem- 
perature is 170 °C. Columns having a length of 1.5 m and a carrier gas (nitrogen) 
flow rate of 40 ml/min are satisfactory. 

231 



2.31 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Place 10 mg of the monosaccharide in a small sample tube and by means of a 
graduated syringe add 0.25 ml of pyridine followed by 0.05 ml of HMDS and 
0.02 ml of TMCS. (CAUTION: This operation should be performed in a fume cup- 
board. The syringe should be carefully rinsed with dichloromethane and dried 
between use with each reagent.) Stopper the sample tube with a plastic cap, shake 
the tube and allow to stand for 20 minutes. Centrifuge the tube at low speeds to 
compact the solid deposit and chromatograph a sample (0. 1 /il) of the super- 
natant liquor. Several monosaccharides should be derivatised and chromato- 
graphed in this manner; an unknown sample (or mixture) should be supplied 
and its identity established with the aid of peak enhancement experiments. 

If excessive tailing of the pyridine peak in the chromatographic trace causes 
difficulty in interpretation (e.g. with pentoses) proceed as follows. Transfer the 
supernatant liquid of the centrifuged solution by means of a dry dropper pipette 
to a small test tube and attach a suitable adapter which is fitted to a cooled 
vacuum trap and pump. Remove the pyridine under reduced pressure; continu- 
ous agitation of the tube in a water bath held at about 50 °C is advisable. Dilute 
the viscous residue with 0.5 ml of dichloromethane and re-chromatograph. 

HIGH PERFORMANCE LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY (h.p.Lc.) 

This technique has become, within the last decade, the prime analytical method 
for those compounds which are involatile or thermally unstable so that they are 
not amenable to g.l.c. analysis. 71-73 They include, to name a few groups only, 
the natural products (carbohydrates, steroids, alkaloids, peptides and amino 
acids, antibiotics, nucleosides, etc.), and the synthetic and naturally occurring 
compounds arising from research in the pharmaceutical, agricultural and food 
industries. Prior to the development of h.p.l.c., analysis of compounds within 
these groups was, for example, either by derivatisation followed by g.l.c. analysis, 
by quantitative t.l.c. or paper chromatographic anaylsis, or by tedious and time- 
consuming conventional liquid-solid or liquid-liquid (partition) chromato- 
graphy. 

In principle, h.p.l.c. arose from conventional liquid column chromatography, 
following the development of g.l.c. and realisation that it was a rapid and accur- 
ate analytical method. This led to a reappraisal of the liquid column chromato- 
graphic system, which in turn resulted in research developments in instrument 
design and in the manufacture of column-packing materials. These now have 
precise specifications to make them suitable for adsorption, normal and reversed 
phase partition, ion exchange, gel permeation, and more recently affinity chro- 
matography. 

The essential features of the equipment may be briefly summarised, but the 
catalogues of the manufacturers (e.g. Beckmann, Macherey-Nagel through Field 
Analytical, Philips Analytical, Perkin-Elmer, Varian, Waters, etc.) and the com- 
prehensive textbooks and monographs should be consulted for detailed discus- 
sions of equipment design and theoretical aspects of this technique. 

The column consists of a stainless steel tube which for analytical work may be 
up to 20 cm in length and in the region of 5 mm internal diameter, although the 
tendency in recent times is for even narrower columns. For preparative opera- 
tions the column length may be up to 50 cm and the internal diameter up to 
20 mm. The column-packing material is of a very uniform particle size, and may 
be, for example, 10, 7, 5 or 4fim; the smaller particle sized material is preferred 
for analytical applications, and the larger particle size for preparative work. The 

232 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.31 



uniformity of grading of these fine particles is one particular feature upon which 
the resolving power of the system depends. Furthermore, because of the expense 
of these column-packing materials, it is usually advisable to fit a guard column, 
which is interposed between the injector system and the analytical column; its 
function is to remove particulate materials and components (impurities) which 
would be strongly retained on the packing material of the analytical (or prepara- 
tive) column and hence ultimately decrease its lifetime. The guard column is 
much shorter in length (say 2.5 cm for analytical columns) and is usually packed 
with the same column-packing material as the main column, but of larger par- 
ticle size. 

A consequence of the column dimensions, and the physical nature of the 
packing material, is the need for a pulse-free pressurised liquid flow through the 
column. The pressures are maintained by a suitable pumping system up to a 
value of 6000 p.s.i. The liquid flow through the column may be from 1 /il/min to 
10/il/min according to the conditions required for the analysis; 2 ^1/min appears 
the normal level for many analyses. Preparative columns are often operated at 
very much higher flow rates. The software provided with the instrument allows 
for convenient selection and alteration of flow rates. The solvent delivered to the 
top of the column (or guard column) by the pump, must be of high purity (avail- 
able for example from BDH, Pierce, Romil, etc.) and usually degassed; the latter 
is required to prevent air-locks being generated during the course of the chroma- 
tographic run. Most instruments are equipped with a solvent delivery system 
which allows for gradient elution; with some instruments the facility for hand- 
ling up to four different solvent sources is available. 

The injector system is often of the loop type. Here the main solvent delivery 
tube to the column top is by-passed in a loop, which may be isolated and depres- 
surised, and injected with sample via a septum. After injection the liquid in the 
loop is released into the main solvent flow. The loop volume is of comparable 
capacity to the injection volume. Most instruments are designed for auto- 
sampling in the case of multiple analyses, the operation being controlled by the 
instrument software. 

The column eluant flows into the detector, usually via a splitter device. The 
most commonly used dual detector system is a u.v. detector in association with a 
refractive index detector. The latter is required for those compounds which do 
not absorb in the u.v., although the versatility of the former is extended by 
employing a variable wavelength detector which will operate over the entire 
range, e.g. 190-700 nm. At the present time it has been suggested that over 70 per 
cent of analyses are carried out with these two detectors. Other detectors are 
available for more specialised purposes, and include a fluorescence detector and 
a conductivity detector. The signal from the detector is, as with the g.l.c. instru- 
ments, fed to a video display unit; the software of the instrument allows all the 
details of the chromatographic run to be recorded, the peaks attenuated without 
the need of repeating the analysis, the results calculated, etc. In the case of pre- 
parative procedures the column eluant may be collected in appropriate frac- 
tions, and the separated compounds isolated in the usual manner. 

Interfacing of h.p.l.c. with other instruments, for the purpose of identifying 
the structure of unknown compounds in a mixture, is a major development 
which might be expected over the next few years. 

Given that the above instrumental features are appropriate, the success of an 
analysis or preparative separation depends on the selection of the column-pack -

ing material. The manufacturers (e.g. Macherey-Nagel, Merck, Phase Separa- 
tion, Pierce, Waters, etc.) supply their own trademarked products, and the 
following is a broad general account of the types of packing available. The most 
widely used packings are based on silica, where the particle shape may be spheri- 
cal or irregular. The importance of particle size distribution is noted above. The 
silica surface may be unmodified, for use in adsorption chromatography, or 
modified with chemically bonded phases, for use in normal phase and reversed 
phase chromatography. Polar bonded phases such as cyano-propyl, or amino- 
propyl, with a less polar solvent system, would be an example of the former; non- 
polar bonded phases such as a C 18 alkyl chain, or an aromatic residue, with a 
more polar solvent (e.g. acetonitrile/water) would be an example of the latter. 
Some of these polar bonded phases may also be used in ion exchange chromato- 
graphy. An important development in chemically bonded phases is the attach- 
ment to the silica surface of an optically pure (chiral) moiety, which results in the 
facility for analysis (and preparative separation) of enantiomers (see Section 
5.19). Glass beads with a porous silica surface, alumina, cellulose acetate and 
polyamide packing materials are also available from the manufacturers, but are 
not as widely used as the aforementioned. 

The packing of h.p.l.c. columns is a far more critical operation than is the case 
with g.l.c. columns, and a considerable degree of expertise and experience is 
required. No attempt is made here to describe the detailed operation. In prin- 
ciple, however, the column-packing material is made into a stable suspension in 
a suitable solvent (e.g. mixtures of toluene : dioxane and cyclohexane). Such sus- 
pensions must not agglomerate or sediment during packing, and this is achieved 
by adjusting the viscosity of the solvent mixture, and by ultrasonic treatment. 
The suspension is transferred to a reservoir, to one end of which is attached a 
pulse-free pumping system, and to the other the empty column. Careful control 
of the pressure during the subsequent packing operation and during the column 
conditioning process by solvent elution is essential in order to obtain columns of 
excellent resolving characteristics. 



2.32 STORAGE OF SAMPLES 

After preparation, all pure products should be stored in suitable clearly and per- 
manently labelled containers. The bulk samples of stable solids and liquids may 
be stored in screw-capped and ground glass stoppered bottles respectively. 
Hygroscopic samples, or those liable to decomposition by contact with atmos- 
pheric moisture, should either be stored in a desiccator or in a bottle which is 
sealed by painting over the closure with molten paraffin wax. Where there 
is a possibility of photochemical decomposition of chemicals it is general good 
practice to keep them out of direct sunlight and to store them in brown 
bottles. 

Small specimens of all products, including reaction intermediates isolated 
from reaction sequences, and particularly samples of fractions isolated as the 
result of lengthy chromatographic or other purification procedures, should in- 
variably be retained for reference purposes. The commercially available straight- 
sided specimen tubes with polyethylene plug seals, which are available in a range 
of sizes, are suitable in the case of solid samples. It is usually advantageous to 
label them with the name and a code reference to enable physical data (elemen- 

234 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.32 



tal analysis, spectroscopic information, etc.) to be located in the laboratory note- 
books. 

Liquid samples may be sealed in specially prepared glass ampoules for pro- 
longed storage or when specimens need to be sent away, for example, for elemen- 
tal analysis. Ready-made ampoules may be obtained commercially in a range of 
sizes or can be made by the following method. A short length of moderately 
thick-walled tubing of internal diameter suited to the sample size is cleaned by 
immersion in a narrow cylinder containing chromic acid cleaning mixture 
(Section 2.2), thoroughly washed with distilled water, followed by a little acetone 
and is then dried by passing a current of warm air through it. One end is then 
sealed off in the blowpipe flame as in Fig. 2.146(a). The constriction is then made 
by carefully rotating the tube in a small blowpipe flame; it is important that the 
wall of the tubing remains uniformly thick at this point. The sample is most con- 
veniently introduced into the ampoule from a capillary pipette or micro-syringe 
needle passing through a protective tube previously inserted into the ampoule 
via the constriction (Fig. 2.146(b)). It is advantageous for the end of this protect- 
ive tube, which should not reach below the final level of the liquid to be intro- 
duced, to be slightly rounded off. This prevents any of the liquid sample which 
adheres to the syringe or capillary pipette from contaminating the outer side of 
the protecting tube. This may be safely withdrawn without danger of introduc- 
ing sample on to the inside surface of the constriction. The ampoule may then be 
sealed off in the usual way using a small flame. 

If the sample needs to be sealed in an atmosphere of nitrogen, the inlet of the 
protecting tube is connected to a low-pressure supply of the gas when the 
syringe or pipette has been withdrawn. When all the air has been displaced the 
tube may be slowly withdrawn and the ampoule sealed. Filled ampoules con- 
taining volatile samples should be thoroughly chilled in a suitable cooling bath

before such air displacement, and before sealing. Care must be exercised when 
sealed ampoules, particularly those which have been stored for some time, are 
reopened, and the precautions outlined in Section 2.3.2, p. 38 should be noted. 

DETERMINATION OF PHYSICAL CONSTANTS 

2.33 DETERMINATION OF MELTING POINT - MIXED MELTING 
POINTS 

A pure crystalline organic compound has, in general, a definite and sharp melt- 
ing point; that is, the melting point range (the difference between the tempera- 
ture at which the collapse of the crystals is first observed and the temperature at 
which the sample becomes completely liquid) does not exceed about 0.5 °C. The 
presence of small quantities of miscible, or partially miscible, impurities will 
usually produce a marked increase in the melting point range and cause the 
commencement of melting to occur at a temperature lower than the melting 
point of the pure substance. The melting point is therefore a valuable criterion of 
purity for an organic compound. 

A sharp melting point is usually indicative of the high purity of a substance. 
There are, however, some exceptions. Thus a eutectic mixture of two or more 
compounds may have a sharp melting point, but this melting point may be 
changed by fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent or mixture of sol- 
vents. The number of exceptions encountered in practice is surprisingly small, 
hence it is reasonable to regard a compound as pure when it melts over a range 
of about 0.5 °C (or less) and the melting point is unaffected by repeated frac- 
tional crystallisation. 

The experimental method in most common use is to heat a small amount 
(about 1 mg) of the substance in a capillary tube inserted into a suitable melting 
point apparatus and to determine the temperature at which melting occurs. The 
capillary melting point tubes are prepared either from soft glass test tubes or from 
wide glass tubing (c. 12 mm diameter).* A short length of glass tubing or glass 
rod is firmly fused to the closed end of the test tube. The test tube (or wide glass 
tubing) must first be thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove dust, 
alkali and products of devitrification which remain on the surface of the glass, 
and then dried. The closed end of the test tube is first heated while being slowly 
rotated in a small blowpipe flame; the glass rod or tube is simultaneously heated 
in the same manner. When the extremities of both pieces of glass are red hot, 
they are firmly fused togeher, twisting of the joint being avoided, and then 
removed momentarily from the flame until the seal is just rigid enough that no 
bending occurs. The test tube is then immediately introduced into a large 'brush' 
flame, so that a length of about 5 cm is heated, and the tube is rotated uniformly 
in the flame. When the heated portion has become soft and slightly thickened as 
the result of the heating, the tube is removed from the flame and, after a second 
or two, drawn, slowly at first and then more rapidly, as far apart as the arms will 
permit (or until the external diameter of the tube has been reduced to 1-2 mm). 

* Pyrex glass is preferable, but this requires an oxygen-gas blowpipe for manipulations. Suitable 
melting point tubes may be purchased from dealers in scientific apparatus or chemicals. It is, how- 
ever, excellent practice for the student to learn to prepare his own capillary tubes. 

236 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.33 



If the operation has been successfully performed, a long capillary of regular bore 
throughout most of its length will be obtained. The long thin tube is then cut 
into lengths of about 8 cm by touching it lightly with a file and then tapping 
gently with the flat portion of the file; after a little practice, no difficulty should 
be experienced in dividing the long capillary into suitable lengths without crush- 
ing the fragile tubing. It will be found that a short length of tubing ('glass 
spindle'), sufficiently rigid to act as a holder, will remain attached to the test tube 
after the long capillary has been cut off. The operation may then be repeated. 
When the test tube becomes too short to be handled at the open end, a piece of 
glass tubing or rod may be fused on, in the manner previously described, to act 
as a convenient handle. In this way a large number of capillary tubes may be 
prepared from one test tube. One end of each of the capillary tubes should be 
sealed by inserting it horizontally into the extreme edge of a small Bunsen flame 
for a few seconds, and the capillary tube rotated meanwhile; the formation of a 
glass bead at the end of the tube should be avoided. The prepared capillary tubes 
should be stored either in a large specimen tube or in a test tube closed with a 
cork. 

The capillary tube is then filled as follows. About 25 mg of the dry substance 
is placed on a glass slide or upon a fragment of clean porous porcelain plate and 
finely powdered with a clean metal or glass spatula, and then formed into a 
small mound. The open end of the capillary tube is pushed into the powder, 
'backing' the latter, if necessary, with a spatula. The solid is then shaken down 
the tube by tapping the closed end on the bench or by gently drawing the flat 
side of a triangular file (a pocket nail file is quite effective) along the upper end of 
the tube. The procedure is repeated until the length of lightly-packed material is 
3-5 mm, and the outside of the tube is finally wiped clean. 

The two principal types of melting point apparatus in common use are those in 
which heating of the capillary tube is by means of a heated liquid bath and those 
in which heating is carried out in, or on, an electrically-heated metal block. 

A convenient form of bath is the Thiele apparatus (Fig. 2.147) in which the 
liquid (1) is contained in a tube with a closed bent side-arm. The thermometer 
(2) is located as shown, being inserted through a cork, a section of which having

been cut away (see inset) so that the thermometer scale is visible, and also to 
allow for expansion of the air in the apparatus. 

Notes. (1) The safest and most satisfacory bath liquids are the highly stable and heat- 
resistant Silicone oils. A cheaper alternative is medicinal paraffin; it has a low specific 
heat, is non-flammable and is non-corrosive, but it can only be safely heated to about 
220 °C; above this temperature it begins to decompose and becomes discoloured. Con- 
centrated sulphuric acid has been suggested for use as a melting point bath fluid but is not 
recommended. 

(2) For melting point (and also for boiling point) determinations, it is convenient to use 
thermometers which have been calibrated by partial immersion to a distance marked on 
the stem (30 mm is suitable for melting points, 80 mm for boiling points). If a ther- 
mometer calibrated by total immersion is used, an error is introduced resulting from the 
cooling of the mercury thread which is not heated in the apparatus but is exposed to the 
cooler laboratory atmosphere. The necessary stem correction to be added to the observed 
melting point to give the 'corrected' value is given by the expression 0.000 16 JV(r, — t 2 ), 
where N is the length of the exposed mercury thread in degrees, t 2 is the mean tempera- 
ture of the exposed mercury thread determined on an auxiliary thermometer placed 
alongside with its bulb at the middle of the exposed thread, and t 2 is the observed tem- 
perature on the thermometer scale. 

The filled melting point tube is attached to the lower end of the thermometer 
in such a way that the substance is at the level of the middle of the mercury bulb 
(which has previously been wetted with the bath liquid); the moistened capillary 
is then slid into position. Providing that the length of capillary tube above the 
level of the bath liquid exceeds the length immersed, advantage is taken of the 
surface tension of the bath liquid to hold the melting-point tube in position by 
capillary attraction. A thin rubber band prepared by cutting narrow rubber 
tubing may be used to attach the capillary tube near its open end to the ther- 
mometer; alternatively the tube may be held in position securely with the aid of 
fine wire. The thermometer, with capillary attached, is inserted into the centre of 
the main tube of the Thiele apparatus. 

On heating the bent side-arm, the heated liquid circulates and raises the tem- 
perature of the sample in such a way that no stirring of the bath liquid is 
required. 

The melting point apparatus is heated comparatively rapidly with a small 
flame until the temperature of the bath is within 15 °C of the melting point of the 
substance, and then slowly and regularly at the rate of about 2 °C per minute 
until the compound melts completely. The temperature at whch the substance 
commences to liquefy and the temperature at which the solid has disappeared, 
i.e. the melting point range, is observed. For a pure compound, the melting point 
range should not exceed 0.5-1 °C; it is usually less. Any sintering or softening 
below the melting point should be noted as well as any evolution of gas or any 
other signs of decomposition.* If the approximate melting point is not known, it 
is advisable to fill two capillaries with the substance. The temperature of the 
bath may then be raised fairly rapidly using one capillary tube in order to deter- 
mine the melting point approximately; the bath is then allowed to cool about 
30 °C, the second capillary substituted for the first and an accurate determina- 
tion made. 

* A substance which commences to soften and pull away from the sides of the capillary tube at (say) 
120 °C, with the first appearance of liquid at 121 °C, and complete liquefaction at 122 °C with 
bubbling, would be recorded as m.p. 121-122 °C (decomp.), softens at 120 °C. 

238 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.33 



It should be noted that a second determination of the melting point should 
not be made as the bath liquid cools by observing the temperature at which the 
molten material in the capillary tube solidifies, or by reheating the bath after the 
solidification has occurred. This is because, in many cases, the substance may 
partially decompose, and in some instances it may undergo a change into 
another crystalline form possessing a different melting point. A freshly-filled 
capillary tube should always be employed for each subsequent determination. 
Substances which sublime readily are sometimes heated in melting point capil- 
laries sealed at both ends. For compounds which melt with decomposition, diffi- 
culties sometimes arise in the melting point determination; it is best to insert the 
capillary tube into the bath when the temperature is only a few degrees below 
the melting and decomposition point of the material. This avoids decomposi- 
tion, with consequent lowering of the melting point, during the time that the 
temperature of the bath liquid is being raised. 

A liquid heating bath may be dispensed with by the use of an apparatus 
employing electrical heating. An electrically heated aluminium or copper block 
is convenient for this purpose. The essential features of the apparatus are shown 
in Fig. 2.148. The large hole in the centre is for a thermometer and the three 
smaller holes are for the melting-point capillaries which can be observed simul- 
taneously through a suitable magnifying eye-piece; the melting point tubes are 
suitably illuminated by one, or two (as shown), side lights. Although the conven- 
tional mercury thermometer is still used in many laboratories, the current design 
of apparatus (Gallenkamp, Jencons, etc.) employs a digital display of tempera- 
ture from a platinum resistance thermometer which responds more readily to 
temperature changes. Electrothermal Engineering have designed an electric 
melting-point apparatus with a digital display, incorporating a hold-switch 
which enables the operator to 'freeze' the display at the moment of melting and 
hence achieve precision measurement while viewing the sample. The rate of 
heating is controlled from the front of the apparatus which allows for both rapid 
heating and variable control. A water-cooled plug is available for lowering the 
temperature of the heating block between tests should this be necessary. 

The Kofler hot bench (C. Reichert Optische Werke AG, available through 
Cambridge Instruments Ltd), illustrated in Fig. 2.149, consists of a metal alloy 
band with a corrosion-free steel surface, 36 cm long and 4 cm wide, heated elec- 
trically at one end, the other end remaining unheated to give a moderate almost 
constant temperature gradient. Fluctuations in the mains voltage are compen- 
sated for by a built-in stabiliser. The graduations cover the range 50 to 260 °C in 
2 °C. Provision is made for variations in room temperature by adjustment on the

reading device moving over the scale. The current must be switched on for about 
40 minutes before the apparatus is required and the latter should be surrounded 
by a screen to protect it from draughts. 

The hot bench should be calibrated before use with the aid of several of the 
substances supplied by the manufacturers. The test substances include: azo- 
benzene, m.p. 68 °C; benzil, m.p. 95 °C; acetanilide, m.p. 1 14.5 °C; phenacetin, 
m.p. 134.5 °C; benzanilide, m.p. 163 °C; p-acetamidophenyl salicylate (salo- 
phene), m.p. 191 °C; and saccharin, m.p. 228 °C. The melting point is readily 
determined by sprinkling a few small crystals of the substance on the hot bench; 
these may be moved along the bench by the brass lancet attached to the reading 
device. Usually a sharp division occurs between the solid and liquid, and the 
temperature corresponding to the line of demarcation is read off on the scale. 
For maximum accuracy, the apparatus should be recalibrated with two test sub- 
stances with melting points close to that of the unknown. The procedure is 
clearly rapid and is very useful for substances which tend to decompose upon 
gradual heating. It is important not to allow any of the molten substance to 
remain on the corrosion-resistant steel surface for long periods; it should be 
wiped away with paper tissues immediately after the experiment. 

The microscope hot stage type of melting point apparatus (C. Reichert 
Optische Werke AG), which is essentially an electrically-heated block on a 
microscope stage, is of particular value when the melting point of a very small 
amount (e.g. of a single crystal) has to be determined. Further advantages in- 
clude the possibility of observation of any change in crystalline form of the crys- 
tals before melting. The main features of the apparatus are shown in Fig. 2.150. 
The apparatus also incorporates a polariser which facilitates the observation of 
melting. The rate of heating is controlled by means of a rheostat; the tempera- 
ture may be measured with a mercury thermometer (two are usually provided 
covering the ranges 20 to 230 °C and 120 to 350 °C), or with a platinum resist- 
ance thermometer and a digital display unit. A microscope cold stage is of sim- 
ilar construction and enables melting points in the range — 50 to + 80 °C to be 
determined; cooling below °C is provided by a supply of liquid carbon dioxide. 

MIXED MELTING POINTS 

In the majority of cases the presence of a 'foreign substance' will lower the melt- 
ing point of a pure organic compound. This fact is utilised in the so-called mixed 
melting point test for the identification of organic compounds. Let us suppose 
that an organic compound X having a melting point of 140 °C is suspected to be 
o-chlorobenzoic acid. Its identity may be established by performing a melting 
point determination on a mixture containing approximately equal weights of X

and of an authentic specimen of o-chlorobenzoic acid (A). If the melting point of 
the mixture is 140 °C, then X is o-chlorobenzoic acid, but if the melting point is 
is depressed by several degrees A and X cannot be identical. It is recommended 
that at least three mixtures containing, say, 20 per cent X + 80 per cent A: 50 per 
cent X + 50 per cent A; and 80 per cent X + 20 per cent A be prepared, and the 
melting points be determined. 

Cases may arise in which the melting points of certain mixtures are higher 
than the individual components, e.g. if an addition compound of higher melting 
point is formed or if the two compounds are completely soluble in the solid state 
forming solid solutions. The mixed melting point test therefore, although a great 
practical value, is not infallible and should accordingly be used with reasonable 
regard to these possibilities. 

EXERCISES IN THE DETERMINATION OF MELTING POINTS AND 
MIXED MELTING POINTS 

The melting points of pure samples of the following compounds are determined 
using a melting point bath or an electrically heated apparatus, in the manner 
detailed above. The correct melting points of the pure substances are given in 
parentheses. 

1. p-Nitrotoluene (54 °C) or azobenzene (68 °C). 

2. 1-Naphthol (96 °C) or catechol (104 °C) or benzil (95 °C). 

3. Benzoic acid (122 °C) or 2-naphthol (123 °C) or urea (133 °C). 

4. Salicylic acid (159 °C) or phenylurea (mono) (148 °C). 

5. Succinic acid (185 °C) or p-tolylurea (mono) (180 °C). 

6. p-Nitrobenzoic acid (239 °C) or s-diphenylurea (242 °C). 

By working in the above order, it will not be necessary to wait for the apparatus 
to cool between consecutive determinations. 

In order to gain experience in the determination of mixed melting points the 
following simple experiment should be carried out. 

Determine the melting point of pure cinnamic acid (133 °C) and pure urea 
(133 °C). Approximately equal weights (c. 50mg) of the two compounds are 
placed on a clean porous porcelain tile. These are now ground together and 
intimately mixed with the aid of the flat side of a micro-spatula. The melting 
point tube filled with this mixture is placed in the melting-point apparatus 
alongside melting-point tubes filled with each of the two components. In this 
way careful observation of the melting behaviour of the mixture and of the pure 
components will clearly show the considerable depression of melting point. 

Similar experiments may be carried out on a mixture of benzoic acid (122 °C) 
and 2-naphthol (123 °C), or a mixture of acetanilide (114°C) and antipyrin 
(113°C). 



2.34 DETERMINATION OF BOILING POINT 

When reasonable amounts of liquid components are available ( &gt; 5 ml) the boil- 
ing point is readily determined by slowly distilling the material from a pear- 
shaped flask in an apparatus assembly shown in Fig. 2.98, and recording the 
temperature at which the bulk of the compound distils. Due attention should be 
paid to the experimental procedure which was discussed in detail in Section 2.24. 

241 



2.34 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



For smaller quantities of liquid compounds (0.5-3.0 ml) the material should 
be distilled in the apparatus assembly shown in Fig. 2.99. 

When only minute quantities of liquid are available, either of the two micro- 
methods for the determination of the boiling point may be used. 

Method 1. (Siwoloboffs method, 1886). Two tubes, closed at one end, are 
required; one, an ordinary melting point capillary, 90-1 10 mm long and 1 mm in 
diameter, and the other, 80-100 mm long and 4— 5 mm in diameter. The latter 
may be prepared from 4-5 mm glass tubing and, if desired, a small thin bulb, not 
exceeding 6 mm in diameter, may be blown at one end. A small quantity of the 
liquid, 0.25-0.5 ml (depending upon the boiling point), is placed in the wider 
tube, and the capillary tube, with sealed end uppermost, is introduced into the 
liquid. The tube is then attached to the thermometer by a rubber band (Fig. 
2.151) and the thermometer is immersed in the bath of a melting-point appar- 
atus. As the bath is gradually heated there will be a slow escape of bubbles from 
the end of the capillary tube, but when the boiling point of the liquid is attained 
a rapid and continuous escape of bubbles will be observed. The reading of the 
thermometer when a rapid and continuous stream of bubbles first emerges from 
the capillary tube is the boiling point of the liquid. Unless the temperature is 
raised very slowly in the vicinity of the boiling point of the liquid, the first deter- 
mination may be slightly in error. A more accurate result is obtained by remov- 
ing the source of heat when the rapid stream of bubbles rises from the end of the 
capillary tube; the speed at which bubbles are given off will slacken and finally, 
when the last bubble makes its appearance and exhibits a tendency to suck back, 
the thermometer is read immediately. This is the boiling point of the liquid 
because it is the point at which the vapour pressure of the liquid is equal to that 
of the atmosphere. As an additional check on the latter value, the bath is allowed 
to cool a few degrees and the temperature slowly raised; the thermometer is read 
when the first continuous series of bubbles is observed. The two thermometer 
readings should not differ by more than 1 °C. It should, however, be remem- 
bered that the Siwoloboff method gives trustworthy results only for comparat- 
ively pure liquids; small amounts of volatile impurities such as ether or water 
may lead to boiling points being recorded which approximate to those of the 
volatile component. 

Method 2. {EmricKs method). A capillary tube about 10 cm long and of about 
1 mm bore is used. One end is drawn out by means of a micro flame into a capil- 
lary with a very fine point and about 2 cm long as in Fig. 2.152(a). Such a capil- 
lary pipette may also be constructed by suitably drawing out soft glass tubing of 
6-7 mm diameter. The tube (a) is then dipped into the liquid of which the boiling 
point is to be determined; the liquid will rise slowly by capillary attraction, and 
the tube is removed when the liquid has filled the narrow conical portion. The 
capillary end is then sealed by merely touching with a minute flame. A small air 
bubble is formed in the point of the capillary; it should be examined with a lens 
to make sure that it is not too large. A convenient size is 1-3 mm long (Fig. 
2.152(b)). The prepared capillary tube is then attached to a thermometer as in a 
melting point determination (Section 2.33) and slowly heated in a Thiele appar- 
atus. The capillary is best observed with a lens. When the bubble enlarges (as in 
Fig. 2.152(c)) and begins to exhibit signs of upward motion, the flame is removed 
or considerably lowered. The temperature at which the bubble reaches the sur- 
face of the bath liquid is the boiling point of the liquid. The bath is allowed to

cool about 10 °C below the first observed boiling point, then slowly heated 
again, and a second determination of the boilng point is made. 

EXERCISES IN BOILING POINT DETERMINATION 

The following pure liquids offer a convenient selection of compounds having a 
range of boiling points: (a) carbon tetrachloride (77 °C); (b) ethylene dibromide 
(132 °C) or chlorobenzene (132 °C); (c) aniline (184.5 °C); and (d) nitrobenzene 
(211 °C). The boiling points may be determined using conventional distillation 
apparatus assemblies. The compounds could also be employed to give practice 
in the determination of boiling point by the Siwoloboff or Emrich methods. 

2.35 DETERMINATION OF MOLECULAR WEIGHT 

Mass spectrometry offers the most refined method for the evaluation of the 
molecular weight of those compounds having vapour pressures higher than 
0.1 mmHg at 350 °C. With instruments of high resolving power, the molecular 
weight is obtained to an accuracy of +5p.p.m. These accurate molecular 
weights may be used to deduce possible molecular formulae with the aid of Mass 
and Abundance Tables 74 which list the accurate mass (up to 500) of all likely 
combinations of C, H, O and N (see also Section 3.3). 

Occasionally the characterisation of an organic compound by means of an 
approximate molecular weight determination may be useful. Methods based 
upon ebullioscopic or cryoscopic procedures are often too time consuming for 
routine use. However, the high freezing point depression of camphor permits 
molecular weights to be determined rapidly and with reasonable accuracy 
(between 1% and 5%) using an ordinary melting-point apparatus (Rast's 
camphor method). 

Support a small clean test tube (e.g. 75 x 10 mm) in a hole bored in a cork so 
that it will stand conveniently on the pan of a balance. Weigh the tube. Intro- 
duce about 50 mg of the compound of which the molecular weight is to be deter- 
mined and weigh again. Then add 500-600 mg of pure, resublimed camphor (e.g. 
the micro-analytical reagent) and weigh again. Stopper the test tube loosely and 
melt the contents by placing it in an oil bath previously heated to about 180°C; 



243 



2.3E PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



stir the liquid with a platinum wire, but do not heat the liquid for more than 

1 minute or camphor will sublime from the solution. Allow to cool, transfer the 
solid to a clean watch glass and powder the solid. Introduce some of the powder 
into a thin capillary tube of which the closed end is carefully rounded; press the 
solid down into the closed end with the aid of a platinum wire or with a closed 
capillary tube of smaller diameter. The height of the solid should not exceed 

2 mm. Determine the melting point of the mixture in a liquid melting point bath 
using, preferably, a 100-200 °C thermometer graduated in 0.1 or 0.2 °C, or in an 
electrically-heated apparatus (Section 2.33). Good illumination and very careful 
control of the rate of heating is essential. The melting point is taken as that tem- 
perature at which the last fragment of solid disappears. To make sure that the 
mixture is homogeneous repeat the melting-point determination with a second 
sample; if the two differ appreciably, prepare a new mixture. Then determine the 
melting point of the original camphor. The difference in melting points gives the 
depression of the melting point of camphor caused by the addition of the com- 
pound. The molecular weight M can then be calculated from the formula: 

M _K x w x 1000 
ATx W 

where K is the molecular depression constant of camphor (39.7), w is the weight 
of the compound, Wis the weight of the camphor and AJis the depression of the 
melting point. 

Note. The solute concentration should be above 0.2 m; in dilute solution K increases 
from 39.7 to about 50. 

The Rast camphor method, although very simple, is nevertheless liable to 
some limitations. One serious difficulty is that the melting point of camphor is 
itself rather high and this may lead to decomposition of the compound whose 
molecular weight is to be determined. Another difficulty is the limited solubility 
of many classes of compound in liquid camphor, and this severely restricts its 
general applicability. Some useful alternative solvents, having high molar freez- 
ing point depression constants are given in Table 2.16.

2.36 DETERMINATION OF OPTICAL ROTARY POWER 

Compounds which rotate the plane of polarised light around its axis, whether 
they are in the gaseous, liquid or molten state, or in solution, are said to be optic- 
ally active. This property arises from the lack of certain elements of symmetry in 

244 



EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES 2.36 



the molecule (i.e. a centre, a plane or an n-fold alternating axis of symmetry) with 
the result that the molecule and its mirror image are non-superimposable. 
Although first observed with compounds having one or more chiral carbon 
atoms (i.e. a carbon substituted with four different groups), optically active com- 
pounds having chiral centres including atoms of silicon, germanium, nitrogen, 
phosphorus, arsenic, sulphur, etc., have also been prepared. Molecular dissym- 
metry, and hence optical activity, also arises in molecules, such as certain substi- 
tuted biphenyls, allenes, etc., which have chiral axes or chiral planes rather than 
chiral atoms as such. The study of optically active coordination complexes is a 
more recent, important and expanding field of study. 

Some of these topics have been elaborated in Section 1.2, where the reader is 
referred to the many excellent monographs and articles which are available, and 
which fully explore the current aspects of the stereochemistry of molecules and 
the importance of stereochemical considerations of appropriate reaction pro- 
cesses. This section is devoted to the experimental determination of optical 
rotatory power. 

When a beam of monochromatic light is passed through a crystal of Iceland 
spar, two beams are transmitted, each vibrating in one plane which is perpendi- 
cular to the other. A Nicol prism is composed of two sections of Iceland spar so 
cut, and again sealed with Canada balsam, that one of these rays is refracted to 
the side (this is absorbed by the black surroundings of the prism) so that the 
light which finally passes through the prism is vibrating in one plane only. This 
light is said to be plane polarised. This polarised light is allowed to pass through 
another Nicol prism similarly orientated and the light viewed from a point 
remote from, but in line with, the light source. It will be found now that on rotat- 
ing the second prism the field of view appears alternately light and dark and the 
minimum of brightness follows the maximum as the prism is rotated through an 
angle of 90°; the field of view will appear dark when the axes of the two prisms 
are at right angles to one another. The prism by which the light is polarised is 
termed the polariser, and the second prism, by which the light is examined, is 
called the analyser. 

If, when the field of view appears dark, a tube containing a solution of an 
optically active compound is placed between the two prisms, the field lights up; 
one of the prisms must then be turned through a certain angle a before the 
original dark field is restored. Since the plane of vibration of polarised light may 
have to be rotated either clockwise or anti-clockwise, it is necessary to observe a 
convention to designate the direction of rotation. When, in order to obtain dark- 
ness, the analyser has to be turned clockwise (i.e. to the right), the optically 
active substance is said to be dextrorotatory, or ( + ); it is laevorotatory, or ( — ), 
when the analyser must be rotated anti-clockwise (i.e. to the left). 

The obvious disadvantage of the above simple instrument (polarimeter) is the 
difficulty of determining the precise 'end-point' or the point of maximum dark- 
ness. The human eye is a poor judge of absolute intensities, but is capable of 
matching the intensities of two simultaneously viewed fields with great accuracy. 
For this reason all precision polarimeters (such as those obtainable from Bell- 
ingham and Stanley Ltd) are equipped with an optical device that divides the 
field into two or three adjacent parts (half-shadow or triple-shadow polari- 
meter) such that when the 'end-point' is reached the sections of the field become 
of the same intensity. A very slight rotation of the analyser will cause one part to 
become lighter and the other darker. The increase in sensitivity so attained is 



245 



2.36 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




Fig. 2.153 

illustrated by the fact that an accuracy of at least 0.01° is easily obtained with the 
use of an 'end-point' device, whereas with the unaided eye the settings are no 
more accurate than 4-5°. 

A half-shadow polarimeter (Lippich type) is illustrated diagrammatically in 
Fig. 2.153. Here two polarised rays are produced by means of the main Nicol 
prism P and a small Nicol prism F; the latter covers half the field of the larger 
polariser P and its plane of polarisation is slightly inclined to that of P. The 
angles between the planes of polarisation may be altered by a slight rotation of 
the polariser P. Upon rotating the analyser A, a position will be found at which 
one beam will be completely, the other only partially, extinguished; the one half 
of the field of view will therefore appear dark, while the other will still remain 
light when viewed with the eyepiece E as in Fig. 2.154(a). Upon rotating the ana- 
lyser A still further, a second position will be found at which only the second 
beam will be extinguished and the field will have the appearance shown in (c). 
When, however, the analyser occupies an intermediate position, the field of view 
will appear of uniform brightness (as in b), and this is the position to which the 
analyser must be set, and the reading from the circular scale S which also incor- 
porates a vernier carefully noted. 

In Fig. 2.153, B is a collimator, T the trough (shown without cover) which 
houses the polarimeter tube C, E the eyepiece and D the heavy support stand for 
the apparatus. N is a device for moving P and thus altering the 'half-shadow 
angle'; this has the advantage of increasing the intensity of light which is 
transmitted by the polarising prism and this may be essential when the optical 
activity of coloured solutions is to be determined. On the other hand the repro- 
ducibility with which the accurate position of uniform brightness of field may be 
ascertained diminishes. 

Two forms of polarimeter tube are shown in Fig. 2.155. The common type (a) 
consists of tube of thick glass with accurately ground ends: the tube is closed by

means of circular plates of glass with parallel sides, which are pressed against the 
ends of the tube by means of screw caps. The caps must not be screwed so tightly 
as to cause strain in the glass end plates as this would cause a rotation; the glass 
plates at the end must be clear and free from finger marks and the exposed sur- 
face must be dry. In a modification, the tube is surrounded by a jacket to permit 
the circulation of water at constant temperature by means of a pump. Tube (b) 
has a cup opening in the centre of the glass tube; the glass plate ends are in this 
case sealed on to the tube with a cement which is inert to most solvents. 

The unit of length in polarimetry is 1 dm, hence the tubes are generally made 
in lengths which are fractions or multiples of this quantity, e.g. 0.5, 1, 2 or 4 dm. 
The tube bore is usually 8 mm and hence the capacity of the 1 dm tube is 5.02 ml. 
Frequently 'neat' liquids or solutions having volumes in the range 1-2 ml need 
to be examined for rotatory power and in these cases polarimeter tubes (usually 
0.5 dm) having a tube bore of 3 or 5 mm are employed. Polarimeter tubes having 
smaller bores (1, 2 or 4 mm) are available, together with other sizes of tubes, 
from Bellingham and Stanley Ltd. Jacketed tubes are available from Optical 
Activity Ltd. 

The filling of these polarimeter tubes requires some attention to detail. Tubes 
which have the wider bore can conveniently be of the centre-filling type (Fig. 
2.155(b)) and it is merely necessary to carefully pour the solution or liquid, 
which must be completely free of suspended particles or droplets of immiscible 
solvents, into the central opening, carefully rocking the tube to disperse air- 
locks; both the tube and the liquid should be at the temperature of the labora- 
tory before filling and the final level of liquid should be within the central cup. 
The end-filling tubes (Fig. 2. 1 55(a)), no matter which size of bore, require a little 
practise to avoid the presence of air-bubbles in the finally sealed tube which 
would hamper the field of view. Having ensured that the tube and the circular 
glass plates (which should be handled by the edges) are clean and dry, one of the 
ends of the tube is securely capped. The tube is then placed vertically on a bench 
surface, sealed end downwards, and the tube is filled nearly to the top of the 
open end with liquid. In the case of the narrow-bore tube a capillary pipette is 
used. In both cases, to avoid air-locks, the end of the pipette is carefully lowered 
to the bottom of the tube (without touching the glass end plate surface) and 
raised as the liquid is allowed to flow into the tube. The final stage of filling re- 
quires that the liquid is allowed to flow slowly from the pipette or capillary 
pipette, until the liquid surface is just 'proud' of the glass tube; the circular glass 
plate is then slid horizontally into position, as the pipette is withdrawn, sweep- 
ing surplus liquid away and providing a seal free of air bubbles. The cap is care- 
fully screwed into position and the filled tube placed horizontally in the 
polarimeter trough T. 

For accurate work it is essential to determine the 'zero' position of the instru- 
ment with the empty polarimeter tube; its position in the polarimeter and the 
exact position of the end plates should be registered by suitable markings. The 
readings on the circular scale (using the vernier) should be noted on about ten 
successive determinations in which the analyser prism is returned to the position 
of uniform brightness both from a clockwise and an anti-clockwise direction and 
the results averaged. The solution in the filled tube, exactly orientated as pre- 
viously, is then examined and the average of ten successive readings of the posi- 
tion of uniform brightness from clockwise and anti-clockwise direction 
determined. Subtraction gives the optical rotation of the liquid or solution. 



247 



2.36 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The magnitude of the optical rotation depends upon: (i) the nature of the sub- 
stance; (ii) the length of the column of liquid through which the light passes; (iii) 
the wavelength of the light employed; (iv) the temperature; and (v) the concen- 
tration of the optically active substance, if a solute. In order to obtain a measure 
of the rotatory power of a substance, these factors must be taken into account. 
As a rule the wavelength employed is either that for the sodium D line, 5893 A 
(obtained with a sodium vapour lamp) or the mercury green line, 5461 A (pro- 
duced with a mercury vapour lamp provided with a suitable filter). The temper- 
ature selected is 20 °C or that of the laboratory t°C. The specific rotation for a 
neat active liquid at a temperature t for the sodium line is given by: 

Mfc-£ 

where a is the angular rotation, / is the length of the column of liquid in deci- 
metres and d is the density at a temperature t. The specific rotation for a solution 
of an optically active substance is likewise given by: 

_ 100a _ 100a 
Ic Ipd 

where / is the length of the column of liquid in decimetres, c is the number of 
grams of the substance dissolved in 100 ml of the solution, p is the number of 
grams of the substance dissolved in 100 g of the solution and d is the density of 
the solution at the temperature t. In expressing the specific rotation of a sub- 
stance in solution, the concentration and the solvent used (the nature of which 
has an influence on the rotation) must be clearly stated. 
The molecular rotation is given by the expression: 

rn-rir rj.it Mi&gt; X M a 

100 /c(mol/100ml) 

where M is the molecular weight. For example, natural camphor has 
[a]£°- 44.3° (c 3.6 in EtOH) and [M]b - 67.3°. 

Measurement of optical rotation, particularly if many samples have to be 
examined, is often more convenient using one of the various types of photo- 
electric polarimeters now available commercially. These detect the balance 
point electronically, and the optical rotation at a single wavelength may be read 
on a micrometer scale or may be displayed on a digital readout. Some instru- 
ments display a warning light if the solution being examined does not allow suf- 
ficient transmission of light for a rotation to be measured (i.e. in the case of dark 
coloured solutions). These instruments (e.g. from Bellingham and Stanley, 
Optical Activity Ltd, or from Japan Spectroscopic Co. Ltd) can measure the 
optical rotation of a few milligrams of sample with high accuracy. Most usually 
the light source is a soldium lamp, but the option of using any of the major mer- 
cury emission wavelengths from a mercury lamp is available. 

Automatic spectropolarimeters are available for the measurement of optical 
rotation as a function of wavelength (in the region 1 80-700 nm), enabling op- 
tical rotatory dispersion (ORD) curves to be recorded. Models are also available 
(e.g. Japan Spectroscopic Co. Ltd) for the measurement of circular dichroism 
(CD) curves in the wavelength region of 180-1000 nm, and 700-2000 nm. Auth- 
oritative accounts of the value of ORD and CD data in studies on the structure

2.37 DETERMINATION OF REFRACTIVE INDEX 

The refractive index of a liquid is a frequently quoted physical constant, which 
together with the boiling point, and chromatographic and spectroscopic 
features, provide the means which aid the characterisation of organic liquids. 

The refractive index of a liquid is conveniently determined with an Abbe 
refractometer (available from, for example, Bellingham and Stanley Ltd). This 
refractometer has the advantage that it requires only a drop or so of the sample 
and the refractive index (usually from 1.3000 to 1.7000) may be read directly to 
0.001 and by estimation to 0.0001. 

The principle of a refractometer is the observation of the 'critical angle' for 
total reflection between glass of high refractive index (e.g. flint glass, n D 1.75) and 
the substance to be examined. The glass is in the form of a right-angled prism 
upon the hypotenuse face AB of which the compound to be investigated is 
placed as a thin film (about 0.15 mm thick) and then covered with a second sim- 
ilar prism (Fig. 2.157). The face AC of the prism plays a part in the refraction of 
the light, and it is the angle of emergence (a) from this face which is measured, 
the scale of the instrument being, however, divided to read the refractive index 
directly. The ray shown in Fig. 2.156 and in Fig. 2.157 is that which enters the 
face AB at grazing incidence and corresponds to the edge of the dark part of the 
field of view observed in the telescope of the instrument (Fig. 2.158). The direc- 
tion of the ray after entering the face AB depends upon its wavelength, and thus 
the scale of the refractive index will vary with the light employed. That selected is 
for the sodium emission line 589.3 nm (the D line), and in high-precision instru- 
ments a monochromatic light source is employed. Routine laboratory instru- 
ments incorporate an optical compensating system which enables a white light 
source to be used. 

To determine the refractive index of a liquid at 20 °C,* water from a thermo- 
static bath is circulated through the jacket which surrounds the two prisms, until 
the temperature on the thermometer of the instrument has remained steady for 
at least 10 minutes. The hinged prism is undamped and both prism surfaces are 
wiped carefully with paper tissue suitable for optical surfaces. An appropriate 
amount of liquid (usually only a drop) is applied to one prism surface and the 
prisms reclamped. The field of view through the telescope is observed and the 
control knob adjusted so that coincidence of the borderline between the light

and dark parts is located on the cross-wires. The refractive index is read directly 
from a scale which is observed through a second telescope. Immediately the de- 
termination has been completed, the prisms are again separated and carefully 
wiped clean using a tissue moistened with a suitable solvent. The accuracy of the 
instrument may be checked by measuring the refractive index of distilled water

CHAPTER 3 

SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE 
INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 



INTRODUCTION 

Spectroscopic methods are used routinely by the organic chemist to provide in- 
formation about the nature of chemical substances. Early in their undergraduate 
course students will be expected to record infrared and ultraviolet spectra of 
compounds they prepare in the laboratory and will be provided with proton and 
carbon- 13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectra and mass spectra of these and 
other compounds. The use of these techniques is an essential adjunct to current 
practice of organic chemistry. 1 This chapter provides an introduction to the use 
of these techniques in organic chemistry; in addition, spectroscopic data are pro- 
vided in Chapters 5 to 8 for many of the compounds whose preparations are de- 
scribed. Students should thus develop the habit of recording such spectra 
routinely and checking the key features against the correlation tables given in 
this chapter and in the appendices. The use of spectroscopic information along- 
side that derived from chemical investigation in order to determine the structure 
of unknown organic compounds is described in Chapter 9. 

The scope and power of spectroscopic techniques has been increased sub- 
stantially in recent years by major advances in instrumentation.* The more sig- 
nificant of these advances have been the development of Fourier Transform 
methods in both nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectroscopy, the use 
of computers as an integral part of instruments to store and analyse data, and 
the linking of chromatographic and spectroscopic instruments, the so-called 
hyphenated techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
(gc/ms), gas chromatography-Fourier Transform infrared (gc/FT-IR). Each of 
these developments has provided the chemist with still more powerful 
techniques to investigate the nature and behaviour of organic compounds. 

The techniques considered in this chapter are infrared spectroscopy (or vibra- 
tional spectroscopy), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible 
spectroscopy (or electronic spectroscopy) and mass spectrometry. Absorption of 
infrared radiation is associated with the energy differences between vibrational 
states of molecules; nuclear magnetic resonance absorption is associated with 
changes in the orientation of atomic nuclei in an applied magnetic field; absorp- 
tion of ultraviolet and visible radiation is associated with changes in the energy 
states of the valence electrons of molecules; and mass spectrometry is concerned

with the analysis of the ionic fragments produced when molecules are caused to 
disintegrate, usually under electron bombardment. 

The availability of low-cost spectrophotometers for the measurement of 
absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the ultraviolet-visible and in the 
infrared regions has resulted in the wide use in recent years of these instruments 
in most laboratories. Intermediates in synthetic sequences and purified reaction 
products are examined routinely to characterise them by comparison of their 
spectra with those of authentic material, or by careful interpretation of the sig- 
nificance of the main absorption frequencies with reference to correlation tables, 
which list the characteristic frequencies associated with the most commonly 
encountered bonding systems. The recognition of structural features by these 
spectroscopic methods supplements the information derived from chemical tests 
and from derivative preparations; the use of these techniques extends further to 
include monitoring the progress of chemical reactions, quantitative analysis^ of 
mixtures of chemical compounds and studies on the effects of structural modifi- 
cations on the characteristic group absorption frequencies (e.g. solvent inter- 
actions, etc.). 

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy developed later than ultraviolet- 
visible and infrared spectroscopy but is now an important tool for the organic 
chemist. Although the instruments are still comparatively expensive, all labora- 
tories require access to the facility. This is often provided by a central service 
which records the spectra of compounds provided by the organic chemist. How- 
ever, simplification of the operation of routine instruments makes it feasible for 
the organic chemist to have direct access to them. The more sophisticated 
instruments, such as those operating at high magnetic fields and those linked to 
gas chromatographs require specialised technical support. All organic chemists, 
however, need to be able to interpret nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. 

In a similar way the routine interpretation of mass spectrometric data by the 
laboratory worker is to be expected, even though the measurement of the spec- 
tra requires the facilities of a central expert service. 

The electromagnetic spectrum - units. The wavelengths of electromagnetic radi- 
ation of interest vary from metres for the radiofrequency range to about 
10 - 10 m for X-rays. A wave has associated with it both wavelength, X, and fre- 
quency, v, which are related by the equation: 

vX = c 

where c is the velocity of the electromagnetic radiation (3 x 10 8 m s - 1 ). Hence 
the wavelength is the distance between adjacent crests while the frequency is the 
number of crests which pass a fixed point in a given time. 

The specific regions and the phenomena they produce are correlated with the 
wavelength and the frequency in Table 3.1. 

Because of the great difference in wavelength of the various regions, it is 
inconvenient to use the same units throughout to specify a particular position in 
the spectrum. In the ultraviolet-visible regions the wavelengths are expressed in 
nanometres (nm, 10 -9 m; formerly this wavelength unit was called a milli- 
micron, m/i). In the infrared region the wavelengths are expressed in micro- 
metres (/an, 10 -6 m; formerly this wavelength unit was called a micron, n), or as 
the reciprocal wavelength in centimetres, 1/1, termed the wavenumber, v. In the 
radiofrequency region absolute frequencies are used rather than the wave-

60 MHz. 



3.1 INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY 2 

The region of infrared spectrum which is of greatest importance to the organic 
chemist is that which lies between 4000 and 660 cm -1 . Absorption bands in the 
spectrum result from energy changes arising as a consequence of molecular 
vibrations of the bond stretching and bending (deformation) type. The positions 
of atoms in molecules may be regarded as mean equilibrium positions, and the 
bonds between atoms may be considered as analogous to springs, subject to 
stretching and bending. Each atom or group of atoms in a molecule oscillates 
about a point at which attraction of nuclei for electrons balances the repulsion 
of nuclei by nuclei, and electrons by electrons. These oscillations have natural 
periods which depend upon the masses of the atoms and the strengths of the 
bonds involved. The amplitude of the oscillations, but not the frequency, can be 
increased by supplying energy by means of electromagnetic radiation. Nuclei 
and electrons bear electric charges, the force required can be supplied by the 
oscillating electric vector of an electromagnetic wave of frequency and phase 
which match those of a particular molecular vibration. Transfer of energy in this 
way is possible if a change in the amplitude of that vibration results in a change 
of molecular dipole moment (the dipole moment may be regarded as analogous 
to the coupling mechanism of a spring); radiant energy is then absorbed and the 
intensity of radiation at this particular wavelength is decreased on passing 
through the compound. The intensity of absorption bands depends upon the 
magnitude of the change in oscillating dipole moment of the bonds during the 
transition, and also is directly proportional to the number of bonds in the mole- 
cule responsible for that particular absorption. Thus hydrogen or carbon 



256 



SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA XI 



bonded to oxygen or nitrogen gives rise to strong infrared absorption because of 
the polarity of these particular bonds. In contrast, no absorption results from 
stretching vibrations in a homonuclear double bond or triple bond which is 
symmetrically substituted; such vibrations are termed infrared inactive. The 
recognition of such bonds is, however, made possible by an examination of the 
Raman spectra of such molecules (i.e. the vibrations are Raman active). 

There are two main types of molecular vibrations: stretching and bending. A 
stretching vibration is a vibration along a bond axis such that the distance 
between the two atoms is decreased or increased. A bending vibration involves a 
change in bond angles. 

For a diatomic molecule A — B, the only vibration that can occur is a periodic 
stretching along the A — B bond. The masses of the two atoms and their connect- 
ing bond may be treated, to a first approximation, as two masses joined by a 
spring and Hooke's law may be applied. This leads to the expression for the fre- 
quency of vibration v in wavenumbers (cm -1 ): 



-(-

where c is the velocity of light (ms -1 ), f is the force constant of the bonds 
(Nm" 1 ) and m A and m B the masses (in g) of the atoms A and B respectively. The 
value of/ is c. 500 Nm -1 for single bonds and about two or three times this 
value for double and triple bonds respectively: it is a measure of the resistance of 
the bond to stretching and is roughly proportional to the energy of the bond. 
Application of this equation to the case of the stretching of a C — H bond, and 
using 19.9 x 10 -24 g and 1.67 x 10 -24 g as the mass values for carbon and 
hydrogen respectively, together with the accepted values for c and/, gives a fre- 
quency of 3020 cm -1 . The stretching of a carbon-hydrogen bond in a methyl or 
a methylene group is actually observed in the regions about 2975 and 2860 cm -1 
respectively; the slight deviation from the calculated value is a reflection of the 
fact that modifications to the frequency of vibration arise from the strengths and 
polarities of the bonds associated with the carbon atom, and these have been 
ignored in this calculation. 

With polyatomic molecules many more fundamental vibrational modes are 
possible. A qualitative illustration of the stretching and bending modes for the 
methylene group is shown in Fig. 3.1. Arrows indicate periodic oscillations in 
the directions shown; the © and © signs represent, respectively, relative move-

ment at right angles to the surface of the page. A symmetrical stretching mode, 
where the hydrogens are vibrating in phase towards and away from the carbon 
nucleus, requires less energy than the corresponding asymmetric stretching mode 
and therefore absorbs at a slightly lower wavenumber. Bending vibrations, 
which are descriptively termed scissoring, rocking, twisting or waging modes, ab- 
sorb at considerably lower wavenumbers since the energy associated with these 
deformations is much less. 

The infrared spectrum therefore consists of a number of absorption bands 
arising from infrared active fundamental vibrations; however, even a cursory in- 
spection of an i.r. spectrum reveals a greater number of absorptions than can be 
accounted for on this basis. This is because of the presence of combination bands, 
overtone bands and difference bands. The first arises when absorption by a mole- 
cule results in the excitation of two vibrations simultaneously, say v l5 and v 2 , 
and the combination band appears at a frequency of v x + v 2 ; an overtone band 
corresponds to a multiple (2v, 3v, etc.) of the frequency of a particular absorp- 
tion band. A difference band arises when absorption of radiation converts a first 
excited state into a second excited state. These bands are frequently of lower in- 
tensity than the fundamental absorption bands but their presence, particularly 
the overtone bands, can be of diagnostic value for confirming the presence of a 
particular bonding system. 

INSTRUMENTAL FEATURES OF INFRARED 
SPECTROPHOTOMETERS 

Until quite recently the commonest forms of infrared spectrophotometers were 
grating or prism instruments in which the sample was exposed only to narrow 
bands of radiation at any one time and the amount of absorption at that wave- 
length was determined by comparison with a reference beam. The wavelength of 
radiation to which the sample was exposed was varied to cover the desired range 
over a period of time. These instruments are still in common use and are de- 
scribed below. Increasingly the prism and grating instruments are being super- 
seded by Fourier Transform infrared spectrophotometers. One report suggested 
that by 1986 there was only one remaining manufacturer of grating instruments 
in the United States as compared with ten manufacturers of Fourier Transform 
instruments. The advantages of FT-IR instruments are speed and sensitivity, 
enabling coupling with g.l.c. equipment to be increasingly used. 

The essential features of the prism or grating spectrophotometer, both for 
infrared and u.v.-visible regions of the spectrum, are a source of radiant energy 
covering the entire region to be measured; a monochromator and slit system to 
isolate monochromatic or narrow wavelength bands of radiant energy derived 
from the source; a compartment to hold both a sample cell and a reference cell 
(frequently in u.v.-visible spectroscopy the sample is dissolved in a suitable sol- 
vent and the reference cell therefore contains the neat solvent; in infrared 
spectroscopy there is often no reference cell, comparison being made between 
the sample and air); a detector to differentiate between the intensity of the refer- 
ence beam and the beam passing through the sample; an amplifier for increasing 
the magnitude of the resultant signal; and a recorder. A hard copy of the spec- 
trum is usually provided by a pen recorder in which the movement of the chart 
paper is geared to the monochromator or its associated mirror system so that 
the position of the pen on the printed chart paper corresponds to the wavelength 
of radiant energy passing through the sample and reference cells. Common 

258 



SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.1 



features of modern spectrophotometers are the presentation of spectra on a 
visual display unit, microprocessor control of instrument conditions and the stor- 
age and analysis of the recorded spectrum using a computer. 

The source of radiant energy in infrared spectrophotometers is a glowing cer- 
amic rod maintained at approximately 1700 °C (Nernst filament). Although 
many spectrophotometers which are used for the routine examination of 
samples employ a sodium chloride prism,* the best results for high resolution 
spectra are achieved by the use of two diffraction gratings to cover the ranges 
4000-1 300 cm -1 (2.5-7.7 /im) and 2000-650 cm -1 (5.0-15.4 /xm) which may be 
selected either at the control panel of the instrument or by an automatic inter- 
change at 2000 cm -1 . All modern grating or prism instruments are double beam 
recording spectrophotometers and the energy difference of the beams emerging 
from the reference cell and the sample cell is measured by the optical null 
method. In this method the resultant signal from the detector is amplified and 
used to drive mechanically a comb device (known as an attenuator) into the 
reference beam to reduce its intensity to that of the sample beam; at this point 
the detector emits no signal and movement of the attenuator stops. The detector 
is a device capable of measuring small differences in temperature of the two 
beams and may be either a thermistor, a thermocouple or a Golay cell. The 
degree of compensation to the reference beam to balance it with the sample 
beam is of course a measure of the absorption by the sample. This method is in 
contrast to the ratio-recording method in which the detector compares directly 
the intensity of the two emergent beams. The cell windows for infrared spectro- 
scopy are made of compressed sodium chloride (most usually), or of potassium 
bromide, silver chloride or caesium bromide. 

DETERMINATION OF INFRARED SPECTRA 

Infrared radiation refers broadly to the wavelength region 0.5-1000 fim. The 
limited portion of infrared radiation between 2 and 15 /xm (5000-660 cm - x ) is of 
greatest practical use to the organic chemist. 

As noted above, for interaction to be possible between the electromagnetic 
radiation and the bonding system of a molecule, leading to uptake of energy and 
therefore to an increase in the amplitude of the appropriate stretching or bend- 
ing vibration, two conditions have to be met: 

1. There must be a change in the charge distribution within the bond undergoing 

stretching or bending, i.e. the dipole moment of the bond must vary during 
vibration so that interaction with the alternating electric field of the radiation 
is possible. 

2. The frequency of the incident radiation must exactly correspond to the fre- 
quency of the particular vibrational mode. 

As the frequency range is scanned the various infrared active vibrations (i.e. 
those involving a dipole moment change) will sequentially absorb radiation as 
the energy equivalence of the radiation and the particular vibrational mode is 
met, giving rise to a series of absorptions. 

A single vibrational energy change is accompanied by a number of rotational 

* Lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride and potassium bromide prisms are used to study with high 
resolution the absorption characteristics of compounds in specified regions (usually in conjunction 
with diffraction gratings), e.g. 4000-1700, 4200-1300, 1 100-385 cm " ' respectively. 

259 



3.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



energy changes and consequently vibrational spectra occur as bands rather than 
as lines. Absorption band maxima are presented either in wavelengths (micro- 
metres, /an) or in wavenumbers (v, expressed as reciprocal centimetres, cm -1 ). 
Band intensities are expressed either as the transmittance T (the ratio of the 
radiant power transmitted by a sample to the radiant power incident on the 
sample I/I ) or the absorbance A (log 10 Jo//)- The intensities of the absorption 
bands in an infrared spectrum are usually indicated qualitatively, e.g. as very 
strong (vs), strong (s), medium (m) or weak (w), etc. 

SAMPLE PREPARATION 

The infrared spectrum of a liquid may conveniently be recorded as a thin film of 
the substance held in the infrared beam between two infrared-transparent discs 
without the need for a diluting solvent. It is customary to use polished plates of 
sodium chloride as the support material; this material is adequately transparent 
in the region 2- 15 /an. Spectra in the longer wavelength region (12-25 /an) can 
be recorded using potassium bromide plates. Sealed cells (p. 267) should be used 
for volatile liquids. 

Great care must be exercised in the handling and use of these plates since in 
particular traces of moisture will cause polished surfaces to become 'fogged', 
thus causing undesirable scattering of the transmitted radiation. Plates are 
stored in air-tight containers containing small bags of a suitable desiccant, e.g. 
silica gel; they should only be handled by the edges and as far as possible under a 
radiant heater. After use the plates should be first wiped with a paper tissue, 
rinsed with a jet of dichloromethane, wiped again with a tissue and finally 
allowed to dry under a radiant heater. Washings should be collected in a suit- 
able container for subsequent recovery. Plates which have become fogged 
through misuse need to be carefully repolished using one of the commercially 
available polishing kits. 

In order to determine the spectrum of a neat liquid sample, a capillary film of 
the pure dry material is formed between a pair of plates by carefully placing 
three small drops on the polished surface of one plate, covering them with the 
second plate and exerting gentle pressure with a slight rotatory motion to ensure 
that the film contains no air bubbles. The prepared plates are then placed in the 
demountable cell holder, ensuring that the gaskets are properly located, and the 
quick release nuts are firmly screwed down (but not too tightly, otherwise the 
liquid will exude from between the plates). The whole assembly is then located in 
the sample beam path of the infrared spectrophotometer. 

With most instruments, before the spectrum is actually recorded, it can read- 
ily be ascertained whether the thickness of the film is adequate to provide a satis- 
factory spectrum by scanning the spectrum rapidly, noting the movement of the 
pen recorder without allowing it to make a permanent trace. This may some- 
times be done by moving the chart paper manually. If it is judged that the band 
intensities are too high, the cell must be dismantled and a thinner film prepared. 
When the spectrum has been recorded, calibration of the wavelength scale may 
be checked by superimposing on the recorded spectrum characteristic peaks 
from the spectrum of a polystyrene film which is inserted into the instrument in 
place of the sample cell. Suitable intense bands of the spectrum occur at 3027, 
2851, 1602, 1028 and 907cm- 1 . 

Solids are generally examined as a mull or in a pressed alkali halide disc 
(usually potassium bromide). For mulls, Nujol (a high boiling fraction of pet- 

260 



SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.1 



roleum) is most commonly used, although when it is desired to study frequency 
ranges in which Nujol absorption bands appear, Fluorolube (perfluoro- 
kerosene, a mixture of fluorinated hydrocarbons), or hexachlorobutadiene is 
employed. The infrared spectra of the mulling agents should be recorded and 
kept available for reference purposes. 

Mulls are prepared by grinding about 2.5 mg of the solid sample with one or 
two drops of Nujol in a small agate pestle and mortar. The mixture must be 
thoroughly ground for at least five minutes to ensure that a fine particle size is 
obtained, so that the light scattering is reduced to a minimum and damage to the 
halide plates by scratching is avoided. The paste is spread on one plate of the 
demountable cell, covered with the other and the sample thickness varied by 
rotating and squeezing the plates to force out excess material. The plates are 
inserted into the cell holder and placed in the sample beam path of the spectro- 
photometer as described above. Rapid scanning of the spectrum in conjunction 
with a knowledge of the spectrum of the relevant mulling agent will give an indi- 
cation as to whether the concentration of the sample in the mull is sufficient to 
provide a satisfactory spectrum. If necessary the concentration should be 
adjusted either by adding more of the sample followed by regrinding or by dilut- 
ing with more of the mulling agent. 

In the pressed disc technique a known weight of sample is intimately ground 
with pure, dry potassium bromide and the mixture inserted into a special die 
and subjected to pressure under vacuum. The concentration of sample in the 
disc is usually in the region of 1.0 per cent. The disc so produced may be 
mounted directly in the sample beam path of the spectrophotometer and the 
spectrum recorded. This method has the advantage that the spectrum so pro- 
duced is entirely due to the sample since pure dry potassium bromide is infrared 
transparent in the 2-25 ^m region. To eliminate the possibility of impurities in 
the potassium bromide, however, a blank disc (no sample) can be made and 
mounted in the reference beam path of the spectrophotometer. Care should be 
taken to ensure that both discs are of equal thickness otherwise inverse peaks 
may occur if the potassium bromide is damp or impure, and this will be particu- 
larly noticeable if the reference disc is thicker than the sample disc. 

The halide used must be of AnalaR grade and should be pre-powdered to a 
particle size which will pass through a 70-mesh sieve; sieving is not absolutely 
necessary provided that each batch of powder is tested to show that it does sub- 
sequently produce good discs. Pre-powdering may be carried out in a mechan- 
ical grinding machine or by hand in an agate pestle and mortar. Drying of the 
powder is best done by leaving it in a shallow dish in an oven at 120 °C for at 
least 24 hours. It may then be transferred to a loosely stoppered bottle which 
should be kept in a desiccator. 

As a general procedure, 500 mg of pre-ground potassium bromide is weighed 
and mixed with the appropriate quantity of the sample (i.e. 5 mg for a 1% disc) 
whose spectrum is to be recorded. The mixture is further intimately ground in a 
vibration mill*; the time required for the grinding depends on the degree of pre- 
powdering but is usually in the region of 1-2 minutes. 

Pressing of the disc is usually carried out in a commercially available stainless 
steel disc die assemblyf under pressure of the order of 8-9 tons/square inch. The

for at least 30 minutes before use. Dies must be scrupulously cleaned after use to 
remove all traces of alkali halide which may corrode the stainless steel. To pre- 
pare the disc proceed as follows: 

1. Push the body of the die (A) on to the base (B) (Fig. 3.2). 

2. Insert one of the stainless steel pellets (C) into the barrel of the die, polished 
face upwards. 

3. Introduce a measured quantity of the ground sample (1 50-250 mg) into the 
bore of (A). 

4. Distribute the powder evenly over the polished surface of the pellet (C) by 
slowly introducing the plunger (D) into the barrel with careful rotation, and 
then rotating it a few times while simultaneously exerting gentle pressure with 
the fingers. 

5. Slowly withdraw the plunger taking care not to disturb the powder which 
should show a surface which is perfectly smooth and free of pits or cracks. 

6. Insert the second pellet into the barrel of the die, polished face downwards, and 
bring into contact with the powder by pressing down lightly with the plunger; 
complete the assembly by pushing the O-ring seal on the plunger into contact 
with the die surface (Fig. 3.3). 

7. Connect the die to the vacuum pump and evacuate for a period of at least 3 
minutes; place the die (while still attached to the vacuum pump) under the 
hydraulic press* and apply a pressure not exceeding 8-9 tons for 1 minute. 

8. Release the pressure and vacuum after this time, invert the die, and remove the 
base (B) (the plunger is kept in position with the fingers). 

9. Place the perspex cylinder on the top of the assembly, which is then returned 
to the hydraulic press, and apply sufficient pressure to lift the lower pellet and 
the disc clear of the barrel (Fig. 3.4). 

10. Finally release the press and remove the die body (A) and the upper steel 
pellet from the face of the disc and then remove the disc itself with tweezers 
(the disc should never be handled with the fingers), and mount it in the spe- 
cially designed holder. These latter operations are best conducted under a 
radiant heater. The disc holder is located in position in the sample beam path 
of the spectrophotometer; if required a blank potassium bromide disc, sim- 
ilarly prepared, is introduced into the reference beam path. 

Providing that care has been taken in the disc preparation the final disc 
should be slightly opaque due to the presence of the sample (the blank disc 
should be transparent). Should the disc show a number of white spots, it is prob- 
able that the mixture has been unevenly ground. If the disc shows a tendency to 
flake, then excessive grinding of the powder is indicated. If after being removed 
from the die the disc becomes cloudy this is indicative of the uptake of water; to 
avoid this difficulty it is necessary to ensure that the die is evacuated for a suffi- 
ciently long period and that the removal of the disc from the die is carried out 
under a radiant heater. 

Several commercially available small-scale, manually-operated presses are 
available for use when the number of halide discs which require to be prepared 
does not warrant the purchase of the more elaborate hydraulic press. They oper- 
ate on the principle of achieving the necessary pressure on the powdered sample

(about 50-100 mg) by spreading it evenly between the optically polished faces of 
two bolts which are then screwed into opposite ends of a cylinder and tightened 
relative to each other. After removal of the bolts, the barrel containing the disc is 
mounted in the specially designed cell slide in the sample beam path of the spec- 
trophotometer. A suitably adjusted metal comb attenuator must be introduced 
into the reference beam path to compensate for the fact that the barrel structure 
of the press which is held in the sample beam restricts the amount of radiation 
which can pass through the halide disc, otherwise even at a wavelength in which 
no absorption is taking place the reference and sample beams will be out of 
balance. The barrel and bolts are cleaned by a stream of tap water, rinsed with 
ethanol, then with dichloromethane and finally dried with paper tissue and 
placed under a radiant heater. Care should be taken not to damage the polished 
surfaces of the bolts by scraping off adhering particles of halide with a spatula or 
by allowing the faces of the bolts to come into contact within the barrel. 

Solutions of either solids or liquids are normally handled in cells of 0.025 mm 
to 1 mm thickness using concentrations of 20 per cent to 0.5 per cent respectively 
in cases of compounds having a molecular weight of about 150. Compounds of 
higher molecular weight are examined at correspondingly higher concentra- 
tions. 

Pure dry chloroform, carbon tetrachloride or carbon disulphide (Section 4.1 
6,7,32, pp. 399 and 41 1) are the solvents most commonly employed. Their selec- 
tion is based upon the fact that they exhibit relatively few intense absorption 
bands in the region 5000-650 cm -1 (Fig. 3.5(a), (b) and (c)). 

In the region of these intense absorption bands it is not possible to record the 
absorption due to the solute, even with the compensating effect of an identical 
path length of the pure solvent in the reference beam, since virtually no radiation 
reaches the detector system and the pen recorder is not activated. 

In the region of the less intense solvent absorption bands, the use of pure sol- 
vent and solution in matched fixed path length cells enables the absorption due 
to the solute to be recorded satisfactorily, providing a sufficiently concentrated 
solution requiring a short path length cell is used. (Clearly a more dilute solution 
necessitating longer path length cells causes the less intense solvent absorption 
bands to become more prominent, thus reducing the overall transmittance in 
this region.) 

For routine use liquid cells are of two types: (a) the demountable cells in 
which the path length may be varied by utilising spacers of lead or Teflon of 
appropriate thickness; these cells have the advantage that they may be easily dis- 
mantled after use for cleaning and if necessary for repolishing of the cell win-

dows; (b) the fully assembled sealed cells of fixed path length (available as 
matched pairs) which use an amalgamated lead spacer forming a permanent 
leak-proof seal; these cells are particularly useful for volatile samples but they 
require much greater care in use since deterioration of the inside plate surface 
necessitates an expensive overhaul. The overall design of these two types is sim- 
ilar and one such example is illustrated in Fig. 3.6. The cell design incorporates 
inlet and outlet ports by means of which the liquid may be introduced. For this 
operation the cell is placed horizontally on the bench with the ports uppermost, 
a syringe needle is inserted into one of the ports, and the solution is injected. The 
passage of fluid across the cavity is easily observed and care must be taken to 
avoid the presence of trapped air bubbles. Teflon stoppers are inserted into the 
ports to keep the liquid within the cell which is then mounted in the sample 
beam path of the spectrophotometer. The neat solvent is similarly introduced 
into the matched cell and placed in the reference beam path. 

The cells are emptied by attachment of one of the ports to a vacuum line 
incorporating a suitable trapping system, cleaned by several rinses with neat sol- 
vent and then with dichloromethane. Solvent is removed by a short period of 
suction and the cell is finally dried under a radiant heater and stored in a desic- 
cator. Prolonged passage of air through the cell must be avoided otherwise 
fogging of the cell windows from atmospheric moisture may occur. 

The most accurate way of compensating for solvent absorption is to use the 
more expensive variable path length cells (Fig. 3.7) in which one of the plates 
which constitute the liquid cell can be moved with the aid of a micrometer device 
to allow adjustment to any required path length. This allows the accurate 
matching in the spectrophotometer of two such cells filled with the appropriate 
solvent. One cell may then be emptied, cleaned and refilled with solution so that 
the spectrum of the solute may be recorded. 

On occasions it is desirable to investigate the spectroscopic properties of 
solutions at high dilution (i.e. 0.005 m), as for example in the study of inter- and 
intra-molecular hydrogen bonding of compounds containing hydroxyl groups.

Such concentrations require cell path lengths in the region of 1.5 cm. The con- 
struction of a cell of these dimensions is relatively simple and a suitable design 
which has found use in these laboratories is shown in Fig. 3.8. 

FEATURES OF AN INFRARED SPECTRUM 

A typical i.r. spectrum is that of acetophenone shown in Fig. 3.9. Some general 
features illustrative of the philosophy relating to the interpretation of spectra 
and the correlation of absorption bands with the presence of particular group- 
ings should be noted. 

It will be immediately apparent that this spectrum may be divided into two 
parts, the first between 4000 and 1600 cm -1 and the second from 1600 to 
660 cm -1 . In the former there are relatively few absorption bands, but in the 
latter a great number of absorptions is observed. Indeed, although as noted 
below aromatic and aliphatic compounds may be recognised from the general 
spectral profile, all organic compounds exhibit this apparent segregation of 
bands into these two main regions. The second region is frequently referred to as 
the 'fingerprint region' since complete superimposability of two spectra in this 
region provides confirmation of identity. 

The former region could be termed the 'functional group region' since, as will 
be noted below, the fundamental vibrational modes of most of the principal 
functional groups absorb in this region. Thus all compounds containing a car- 
bonyl group (whether it be an aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, acid chloride, 
amide, ester, etc.) will exhibit strong absorption in the 1700 cm -1 region. 

Aromatic compounds, of which the spectrum in Fig. 3.9 is typical, always ex- 
hibit sharp and often numerous bands in the fingerprint region. Aliphatic com- 
pounds on the other hand give rise to far fewer, broad, bands in this region. 
These differences in the profile of the spectra of aromatic and aliphatic com- 
pounds provide a valuable first step in spectral interpretation. 

Correlation charts and tables. Central to the philosophy of i.r. spectral interpre- 
tation is the fact that many stretching and bending modes in a molecule are vir- 
tually independent of changes of structure at more remote sites. Structural 
modifications closer to the absorbing centre do of course affect the energy asso- 
ciated with the absorption, and lead to a shift of the absorption band to higher 
or lower frequencies. These frequency shifts, however, have been found to lie 
within defined limits and the numerical value often provides valuable informa- 
tion on the structural environment of the associated group. For example, the 
absorption maximum for the carbon-hydrogen stretching frequency lies in the 
general region around 3000 cm -1 ; if the carbon is sp 3 -hybridised the maximum 
is just below 3000 cm - 1 ; if the carbon is sp 2 -hybridised the position is just above 
3000 cm -1 and if the carbon is sp-hybridised the position is at about 3250 cm - 1 . 
The remarkable constancy of these absorption positions for the carbon- 
hydrogen stretching mode in all organic compounds examined enables the re- 
verse deduction to be made, i.e. absorption bands exhibited by an unknown 
compound in the region of 2800-2900 cm - 1 and in the region of 3040 cm -1 
would indicate the presence of both saturated carbon-hydrogen bonds and 
carbon-hydrogen bonds in an alkene or an aromatic system. 

The band positions for all the major structural bonding types have been 
determined and correlation charts and tables are available which give the ranges 
within which particular bonding types have been observed to absorb. A simpli-

SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA XI 



fied correlation chart is provided by Fig. 3.10 which indicates the ranges within 
which the stretching and bending absorptions have been observed. This chart 
has been prepared on a typical spectral grid since rapid recognition of significant 
absorption bands is usually achieved by such visual familiarity with wavelength 
regions. The alternative and more accurate and informative way of presenting 
correlation information is by means of tables. These have been collected in 
Appendix 2, Tables A2.l-A2.13. It is to these tables that reference should be 
made when endeavouring to elucidate the structure of a compound from the 
infrared spectrum. 

INTERPRETATION OF AN INFRARED SPECTRUM 

The spectrum of acetophenone (Fig. 3.9) provides the opportunity for illustrat- 
ing one possible method which may be adopted to correlate the absorption 
bands in a spectrum with the bonding types from which they arise. It is import- 
ant that as much information as possible should be extracted from the func- 
tional group region first, then further information sought in the fingerprint 
region as a result of these conclusions. It is usually unwise to haphazardly relate 
intense peaks to specific structural features and the following represents a more 
logical approach.* The correlation chart above may be used in this simple illus- 
tration. 

Consideration of the general profile provides circumstantial evidence that the 
compound may be aromatic. By looking first at the absorption band in the 
3000 cm -1 region it is apparent that there are present sp 2 -hybridised carbon- 
hydrogen bonds (absorption just above 3000cm -1 ) as well as sp 3 -hybridised 
carbon-hydrogen bonds (absorption just below 3000 cm -1 ). The only other sig- 
nificant absorption in the region above 1600cm -1 is the band at 1680cm -1 . 
This is clearly due to the presence of a carbonyl group. Thus the compound may 
be either an olefinic or an aromatic compound containing a carbonyl system. 

The differentiation is easily made by noting the characteristic absorption 
bands corresponding to the aromatic ring system around 1600-1450 cm -1 and 
850-660 cm -1 , and the characteristic pattern in the overtone region around 
2000-1800 cm -1 . The origin of these absorptions is discussed in detail below; 
their presence in this spectrum clearly shows that the structure is a mono- 
substituted aromatic compound. 

The precise position of the carbonyl band, which is at the lower end of the 
frequency range, may now be rationalised. It implies that the carbonyl function 
is in conjugation with the aromatic 7i-electron system leading to reduced double 
bond character, a weaker carbon-oxygen bond and hence a lower absorption 
frequency. This conjugation is confirmed by observing the increased intensity of 
the 1580 cm -1 band associated with the aromatic ring vibration. 

It is now necessary to deduce the nature of the carbonyl function (i.e. whether 
it is an aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc.). Each of these functional groups (with the 
exception of ketones) exhibits further characteristic and identifiable absorption 
bands due to the attachment of atoms other than carbon to the carbonyl carbon 
atom. Thus an aldehyde should exhibit a double band in the region of 2830- 
2700 cm -1 , due to stretching of the C — H bond in the aldehydic group. A car- 

* This approach, which is developed in more detail below, is based on the method used by the late 
Dr L. J. Bellamy, CBE, in his lectures and tutorials on i.r. spectroscopy to postgraduate students in 
the School of Chemistry and with which the editors were privileged to be associated. 

271 



3.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



boxylic ester would exhibit a pair of intense absorptions near 1300 and 
1100 cm -1 due to C — O stretching modes. Logical, sequential and careful 
searching in the two regions of the spectrum for the presence or absence of diag- 
nostic bands as indicated above would finally lead to the conclusion that the 
compound was a monosubstituted aromatic ketone. It is in this situation that 
negative information is as important as positive information, i.e. the absence of 
the double band at about 2800 cm - 1 eliminates from consideration the possibil- 
ity of an aldehyde. That the compound is likely to be acetophenone could be 
deduced from the relatively weak absorption in the region below 3000 cm - 1 and 
the presence of absorption at 1 370 cm - 1 , the latter being characteristic of one of 
the deformation modes of a methyl group. Positive identification would be most 
readily achieved by consideration of the p.m.r. spectrum. 

The following summary provides a recommended approach to the interpre- 
tation of an unknown spectrum which may be adopted until experience has de- 
veloped an intuitive appreciation of the characteristics of infrared spectra. It 
should be used in association with the more detailed notes which follow, describ- 
ing the way in which characteristic group frequencies arise and the variations in 
frequency position which accompany environmental changes. 

1. Obtain a satisfactory spectrum of the unknown dry compound using the tech- 
niques which have been described above. If the spectrum has been supplied, 
make a careful note of the conditions under which the spectrum was 
recorded, any solvents used, etc. 

2. Qualitatively assess from the spectrum profile whether the compound is likely 
to be aliphatic or aromatic in type. 

3. Mark any absorptions apparent in the spectrum which are known to arise 
from the solvent or mulling agent used. 

4. Inspect the C — H stretching region and identify the bands as either of alipha- 
tic or aromatic/olefinic origin. 

5. Evaluate the degree of carbon chain branching by approximately assessing 
the methyl.methylene ratio from the relative intensity of the absorption 
bands in the saturated C — H region below 3000 cm -1 . This may necessitate 
re-recording the spectrum on a grating instrument to obtain better resolu- 
tion. 

6. Search the high frequency end of the spectrum, i.e. the region 4000- 
3000 cm - *, for the presence of bands arising from the presence of — O — H, 
— N— H and =C— H bonds. 

7. Extract from the spectrum information provided by the presence of relatively 
intense absorption bands in the region 2500-1600 cm -1 . This should provide 
evidence for the presence or absence of C=C, C=N, C=0, C=C. 

8. As a result of the conclusions deduced from 4—7, attempt to classify the com- 
pound; on the basis of this classification search the fingerprint region for spe- 
cific evidence to support the postulated structure. Examples are: (a) if an 
aromatic compound is suspected because of =C — H absorption, confirm by 
examination of the region 1600, 1580, 1500 and 1450cm -1 and then en- 
deavour to establish the substitution pattern by looking specifically in the 
850-650 cm -1 region, and then in the overtone region, 2000-1800 cm -1 ; (b) if 
an alkene is suspected, search for evidence of its substitution type; (c) if a car- 
bonyl group is present, deduce its nature by searching for evidence of the 
presence of associated groups, etc. 

272 



SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.1 



9. If no absorption bands are present in the functional group region, with the 
exception of those arising from carbon-hydrogen stretching modes, consider 
the possibilities of ethers, alkyl halides, sulphur compounds, tertiary amines 
and nitro compounds as detailed in the sections below. 

10. Relate the structural information deduced in this way with that obtained by 
other spectral methods or by appropriate chemical tests. 

CHARACTERISTIC GROUP FREQUENCIES 

Alkanes, cycloalkanes and alkyl groups. The diagnostically important bands in 
these compounds arise from C — H stretching and bending vibrations, although 
some bands due to C — C skeletal vibrations are also of value. 

Alkanes. Methyl and methylene groups both have asymmetric and symmetric 
C — H stretching vibration modes, giving rise to four absorption bands just 
below 3000 cm -1 ; the CH 3 vibration modes are shown in Fig. 3.1 1 and the CH 2 
vibrations are those depicted in Fig. 3.1. The absorption bands are not normally 
resolved by prism spectrophotometers, and in the spectrum of decane (Fig. 3.12) 
recorded on such an instrument the C — H vibrations are revealed as two over- 
lapping bands just below 3000cm -1 . With grating instruments the absorption 
bands are resolved so that the CH 3 asymmetric and symmetric vibrations which 
occur near 2962 and 2872 cm - 1 respectively, and the CH 2 asymmetric and sym- 
metric vibrations which occur near 2926 and 2853 cm -1 respectively, are clearly 
visible. These absorption positions do not vary much in the case of unsubsti- 
tuted alkanes. However, very useful qualitative information can be obtained, 
regarding the relative number of CH 3 and CH 2 groups in an alkane, by inspec- 
tion of the relative intensities of these bands, since these are dependent on the 
number of such groups present in a compound. This is illustrated by the part 
spectra recorded on a high resolution (grating) spectrophotometer shown in 
Fig. 3.13(a)-(c). Spectrum (a) is that of hexane which has a similar number of 
methyl and methylene hydrogens so that the corresponding bands are of 
approximately equal intensity. In decane (spectrum (b)), on the other hand, the 
two CH 2 bands are much more intense than the CH 3 bands; in cyclohexane

(spectrum (c)) only the two CH 2 absorption bands are observed. A highly 
branched alkane will thus show strong CH 3 and weak CH 2 bands. Tertiary 
C — H stretching vibrations produce a weak band near 2890 cm - 1 which is often 
masked by the other C — H bands. 

The CH 3 group has two C — H deformation vibrational modes which are 
shown in Fig. 3.11; the asymmetric vibration gives a band near 1450cm -1 
and the symmetric 'umbrella-like' vibration a band near 1375 cm -1 . The four 
possible bending modes of the CH 2 group are those shown in Fig. 3.1; the scis- 
soring vibration gives a band near 1465 cm - 1 which overlaps with the asymmet- 
ric band near 1450cm -1 . The position of the CH 3 band (1375cm -1 ) is 
remarkably constant when attached to carbon and this allows ready recognition 
of the C — CH 3 group in a molecule. When a second methyl group is attached to 
the same carbon atom as in the isopropyl group, splitting of this band occurs to 
give two bands of approximately equal intensity. The 1375 cm -1 band arising 
from a t-butyl group is also split, but in this case the intensities of the two bands 
are in the ratio of approximately 2 : 1 with the less intense band at higher fre- 
quencies. 

Compounds containing at least four adjacent methylene groups, i.e. 
— (CH 2 )„ — , n ^ 4, show a weak band near 725 cm -1 due to the four groups 
rocking in phase; this band increases in intensity with increasing length of the 
chain.

Cycloalkanes. The C — H stretching vibrations of unstrained ring systems give 
rise to bands in the same region of the spectrum as acyclic compounds; as the 
size of the ring decreases however there is a shift to higher frequency and cyclo- 
propanes give a band in the 3060-3040 cm - 1 region of the spectrum. The ab- 
sence of CH 3 stretching bands in the spectrum of cyclohexane has been 
commented on above, and there will not of course be any bands in the methyl 
C — H bending region; the absence of the C — H bending bands may also be 
noted in the spectrum of cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde, Fig. 3.29. 

Alkyl groups. The symmetric stretching vibration of a methyl group when 
attached to nitrogen or oxygen results in absorption at a lower frequency than 
when attached to carbon; additionally, the symmetric deformation vibration in 
compounds containing NCH 3 and OCH 3 groups leads to absorption at a 
higher frequency. These frequency shifts are of some diagnostic value for the 
identification of such groups (e.g. the spectrum of anisole, Fig. 3.25, and the 
spectrum of iV-methylaniline, Fig. 3.27), although reliable confirmation would 
be obtained from a p.m.r. spectrum. 

The attachment of a methyl or methylene group to a carbonyl group results 
in the C — H symmetric bending deformations becoming more intense and the 
bands appear at slightly lower frequency than normally.

The correlation tables for alkanes, cycloalkanes and alkyl groups are in 
Appendix 2, Table A2.1. 

Alkenes. The presence of unsaturation in a molecule can usually be readily 
recognised by the presence of a small sharp band just above 3000 cm -1 due to 
the unsaturated =C — H stretching vibration. Aromatic C — H bonds also show 
weak absorption in this region, but there are, however, other distinguishing 
features in the i.r. of aromatic compounds which readily enable them to be differ- 
entiated from alkenes. The precise position of the band depends on the nature of 
the alkene. For example, the terminal methylene group in vinyl ( — CH=CH 2 ) 
and gem-disubstituted (&gt;C=CH 2 ) alkenes absorb in the 3095-3075 cm -1 
range, and the =C — H bond in cis-, trans- and trisubstituted alkenes absorbs 
at 3040-3010 cm -1 , a region which may be masked by strong absorption due to 
saturated C — H stretching vibration bands when alkyl groups are present in the 
compound. 

The C — H out-of-plane bending or wagging vibrations of hydrogens 
attached to unsaturated carbons give rise to important absorption bands in the 
1000-800 cm -1 region. These are frequently strongest in the spectra of simple 
alkenes, and they readily allow one to ascertain the substitution pattern of the 
alkene; thus the vinyl group shows two strong bands near 990 cm -1 and 



277 



3.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



910cm -1 , whereas a trans-disubstituted alkene shows only one strong band 
near 965 cm -1 . 

In-plane bending of the unsaturated C — H bond gives rise to absorption in 
the 1420-1290 cm -1 region which is frequently of weak intensity. As this 
absorption occurs in the region of the spectrum associated with C — C stretching 
and saturated C — H bending vibrations, it is of little diagnostic value, but can be 
of use in confirming the presence of a double bond, e.g. the in-plane bending 

vibration (or scissoring) of the =C^ k group produces a band near 
1415cm -1 . H ^ 

The C=C stretching vibration gives rise to an absorption band in the 1680- 
1620 cm -1 region in simple alkenes. The band is of variable intensity, but is 
much less intense than that from the C=0 stretching vibration which also leads 
to absorption in this region, a consequence of the very much less polar character 
of the olefinic bond. In general, the more highly substituted the double bond, the 
higher is the frequency at which it absorbs, and the lower is its intensity; thus the 
vinyl group gives a relatively strong band near 1640 cm -1 and can be readily 
seen in the spectrum of oct-1-ene (Fig. 3.14), which is typical for a simple vinyl 
alkene. 

Attachment of a polar group normally lowers the C=C stretching frequency, 
so that, for example, vinyl chloride absorbs at 1610 cm - 1 and vinyl bromide at 
1593 cm -1 ; slight frequency shifts outside the above range can also occur when 
the double bond is exocyclic to a ring system; thus a methylene group attached 
to six-, five-, four- and three-membered ring systems absorbs respectively at 
1651 cm -1 , 1657cm -1 , 1678 cm -1 and 1736cm -1 , a shift which is associated 
with increasing ring strain. It should be noted that there will be no C=C stretch- 
ing absorption band in the spectrum of symmetrically substituted frans-olefinic 
compounds such as trans- 1,2-dichloroethylene and fumaric acid. Despite the 
fact that there are highly polar bonds in each of these compounds, because of the 
symmetry of the molecules, stretching of the C=C bond does not result in any 
change in the oscillating dipole moment, so this vibration is infrared inactive. 
The vibrations of these bonds may however be readily observed in the Raman 
spectrum.

When a C=C bond is conjugated with a carbonyl group, another double 
bond or an aromatic ring, the bond has less double-bond character, i.e. is 
weaker, and the absorption shifts to longer wavelength (lower wavenumber), 
while the increased polarity of the double bond results in a considerable 
enhancement in intensity. With conjugated aliphatic systems, the number of 
absorption bands observed is the same as the number of conjugated double 
bonds; thus dienes, trienes and tetraenes show two, three and four bands respect- 
ively in the 1650-1 600 cm -1 region. 

The correlation table for alkenes is in Appendix 2, Table A2.2. 

Aromatic compounds. A characteristic feature of the i.r. spectra of aromatic 
compounds is the presence of a relatively large number of sharp bands, and par- 
ticularly diagnostic are those near 3030 cm -1 due to =C — H stretching vibra-

tions and those in the 1600-1450 cm -1 region which result from the in-plane 
skeletal vibrations of the aromatic ring. These latter vibrations involve expan- 
sion and contraction of the carbon-carbon bonds within the ring of the type 
indicated in the exaggerated formulations in Fig. 3.15; the bands usually occur 
near 1600, 1580, 1500 and 1450cm -1 . The band at 1450cm -1 is often quite 
strong but since it occurs in the absorption region associated with the alkyl 
C — H bending vibrations its diagnostic value is somewhat limited. The inten- 
sities of the other bands vary widely; in particular the band near 1580 cm -1 is 
normally very weak and appears as a shoulder on the side of the 1600 cm -1 
band. When a carbonyl or other similar group is conjugated with the ring, how- 
ever, the intensity of the band is increased; this effect can be clearly seen by com- 
parison of the spectrum of o-xylene, Fig. 3.16, with that of acetophenone, Fig. 
3.9, and phenylacetylene, Fig. 3.19. 

It is useful to note that the variations in intensity of the 1580 cm -1 band 
parallel that of the much stronger 1600 cm - 1 band, which also exhibits large in- 
tensity fluctuations and may indeed be completely absent from the spectrum. 
Occasionally the 1600 cm - 1 band may be masked by other bands such as those 
resulting from conjugated C=C or NH 2 groups which absorb in this region. 
Wide variations in the intensity of the band near 1500 cm -1 can also occur, but 
in general one or other of the 1500 and 1600 cm -1 bands will be quite strong, 
and notwithstanding these intensity fluctuations, there is usually no difficulty in 
practice in establishing the presence of an aromatic ring. Polycyclic aromatics 
such as naphthalene, and also pyridines, show bands in very similar positions. 

The in-phase, out-of-plane, wagging vibrations of adjacent hydrogens of sub- 
stituted benzenes give rise to strong absorption in well-defined frequency ranges 
in the 900-690 cm -1 region of the spectrum. The number of adjacent hydrogen 
atoms determines the number and positions of the bands which are therefore of 
great value for establishing the substitution pattern of a benzenoid compound 
(see Appendix 2, Table A2.3). In the case of monosubstituted benzenes the five 
adjacent hydrogen atoms give rise to two absorption bands in the region of 770- 
730 and 7 10-690 cm -1 (cf. the spectrum of N-methylaniline, Fig. 3.27). With 
ortho-substituted compounds (e.g. the spectrum of o-xylene, Fig. 3.16), the four 
adjacent hydrogens lead to a single absorption in the region of 770-735 cm -1 . 
The absorption pattern with a meta compound arises from the absorption of 
three adjacent hydrogens together with that of a single hydrogen, so that two 
bands are apparent, one at 8 10-750 cm - 1 and the second at 900-860 cm - 1 [Fig. 
3.17(a)]. Para-substituted compounds show a single absorption at 860- 
800 cm -1 due to two adjacent hydrogens. These correlations are also applicable 
to polycyclic compounds; for example, the spectrum of 1,2-dimethylnaphthalene 
is entirely consistent with the presence of four adjacent and two adjacent hydro- 
gens [Fig. 3.17(b)].

These correlations hold also for pyridine systems; the ring nitrogen atom 
counts as a substituent so that a 2-substituted pyridine will be expected to show 
a band due to the vibrations of four adjacent hydrogen atoms. 

Considerable deviation from the ranges given in Appendix 2, Table A2.3, can 
occur when a highly polar substituent such as — C=0 or — N0 2 is attached to 
the ring system. In this situation more reliable information can be obtained from 
inspection of the absorption pattern in the 2000-1 600 cm -1 region, which arises 
from coupling vibrations and overtone bands of the C — H wagging vibrational 
modes. The pattern, rather than the positions of these absorption bands, is char- 
acteristic and may be used to confirm the degree of aromatic substitution. A 
schematic representation of these summation bands is shown in Fig. 3.18. It

SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.1 



should be noted that the absorption is extremely weak and the bands are fre- 
quently barely visible when the spectrum is recorded under normal conditions. 
Hence to enable the absorption patterns to be recognised, neat liquids or con- 
centrated solutions of solids (~ 10%) should be examined in a 1.0-mm cell. 
The correlation table for aromatic compounds is in Appendix 2, Table A2,3. 

Alkynes and allenes. Absorptions arising from multiple bond stretching vibra- 
tions are important features in the i.r. spectra of both these types of compounds. 

Alkynes. Monosubstituted alkynes are characterised by a strong sharp absorp- 
tion band near 3320 cm -1 arising from the =C — H stretching vibration. 
Bonded N — H and O — H bands also appear in this region but they are, in con- 
trast, quite broad and cannot be confused with the =C — H band. The C=C 
stretching vibration gives rise to a weak absorption in the 2260-2100 cm -1 
region of the spectrum, and a frequency difference of about 100cm -1 between 
mono- and disubstituted alkynes allows them to be differentiated. The intensity 
of the C=C band is variable, and while it is readily observed in the spectrum of a 
monosubstituted alkyne, it may be very weak or absent from the spectrum of a 
disubstituted alkyne, depending on the nature of the substituents. Symmetrically 
disubstituted alkynes, such as acetylenedicarboxylic acid, do not exhibit absorp- 
tion while, in contrast, if the two substituents are sufficiently different in charac- 
ter that the C=C bond is made more polar, a relatively strong band may be 
observed. The C — H bending absorption of monosubstituted acetylenes occurs 
in the range 680-610 cm - 1 and is usually quite strong; aromatic acetylenic com- 
pounds show two bands in this region. A broad band in the 1300-1 200 cm -1 
range is believed to be an overtone or combination band derived from the C — H 
bending vibration. The spectrum of phenylacetylene, Fig. 3.19, is an instructive 
example; in addition to the strong =C — H band at 3310cm -1 and C=C 
stretching band at 2100cm -1 , other noteworthy and clearly visible features in- 
clude the sharp aromatic C — H stretching band at 3070 cm - 1 , the fairly strong 
'ring breathing' vibration bands in the 1600^1420cm -1 region and the strong 
C — H in-phrase wagging bands at 770cm - 1 and 690 cm - 1 ; these latter give rise 
to weak overtone and combination bands in the 2000-1650 cm -1 region which 
are characteristic of a monosubstituted benzene. 

Allenes. Allenes show a moderately intense band (sometimes as a double peak) 
at 2000-1900 cm - 1 due to the asymmetric C=C=C stretching vibration, which 
can be seen (near 1970cm -1 ) in the spectrum of l-bromo-3-methylbuta-l,2- 
diene (Fig. 3.20). A terminal =CH 2 group gives rise to a strong band near 
850 cm -1 , with an overtone near 1700 cm -1 , and is the result of the out-of-plane 
CH 2 wagging vibration analogous to the CH 2 wagging vibration in vinyl com- 
pounds. 

The correlation tables for alkynes and allenes are in Appendix 2, Table A2.4. 

Alcohols and phenols. Both these classes of compounds are characterised by the 
strong absorption resulting from the O — H stretching modes; the position and 
shape of the bands are sensitive to the electronic and steric features of the com- 
pound and also to the physical state of the sample. Absorption bands arising 
from C — O stretching and O — H bending vibrations are also of diagnostic 
value. 

Examination of dilute solutions of simple alcohols or phenols in a non-polar 
solvent such as carbon tetrachloride reveals the free O — H stretching band in

the 3650-3590 cm - 1 region; the precise position of the band has been correlated 
with the nature of the carbon atom to which the hydroxyl group is attached. 
Thus the absorption frequency shifts to lower values in the order primary, 
secondary, tertiary or phenolic hydroxyl. However, definitive assignment of the 
group associated with the hydroxyl on the basis of the position of this band only 
is not advisable. More usually the spectrum will be recorded in the neat liquid or 
solid state, and in this case the O — H band is recognised by a strong broad band 
in the 3400-3200 cm - 1 region; see the spectra of heptan-1-ol (Fig. 3.21) and 
w-cresol (Fig. 3.22). This broadening and shift to lower frequency is due to inter- 
molecular hydrogen bonding which results in a weakening of the O — H bond. In 
simple compounds such as heptan-1-ol, hydrogen bonding is of the polymeric 
type, although in solution in a non-polar solvent the hydrogen bonds are partly 
broken and the spectra normally show additionally some free OH absorption. 
As the solution is made more dilute the extent of hydrogen bonding is decreased 
resulting in a decrease in the intensity of the bonded band, and an increase in the 
intensity of the absorption due to the free OH group. This effect is illustrated in 
Fig. 3.23(a)-(c). 

Some compounds, such as highly substituted alcohols and ortho substituted 
phenols, are unable, for steric reasons, to form polymeric hydrogen bonded spe- 
cies, and hence they exist only as dimers which gives rise to sharp absorption in 
the 3550-3450 cm -1 region. In these instances hydrogen bonds are also broken 
on dilution with the consequence that the absorption intensity and position 
change. 

1,2-Diols and phenols having a carbonyl or nitro group in the ortho position 
exhibit intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which is not affected by dilution; hence 
solution spectra and the effects resulting from dilution can give considerable in- 
sight into the nature of the alcohol or phenol. In compounds such as o-hydroxy- 
acetophenone, hydrogen bonding is extremely strong as a consequence of 
resonance stabilisation of the bonded species, and absorption is in the 3200- 
2500 cm -1 region, while 1,2-diols show sharp bands of variable intensity at 
3570-3450 cm - \ reflecting the weaker hydrogen bonding in these compounds. 

The OH group in a carboxylic acid, and N — H bonds in general, absorb in 
this region of the spectrum but the bands are usually readily distinguishable 
from each other (see carboxylic acids and amines below). 

The C — O stretching band is strong and appears in the fingerprint region of 
the spectrum. The position is somewhat dependent on the physical state of the 
sample but it is usually possible to ascertain the type of hydroxyl compound 
under investigation; thus w-cresol shows absorption in the phenolic C — O 
stretching region at 1 330 cm - 1 , whereas the band at 1060 cm - 1 in the spectrum 
of heptan-1-ol is characteristic for primary alcohols. 

The correlation tables for alcohols and phenols are in Appendix 2, Table 
A2.5. 

Ethers and cyclic ethers. The i.r. spectrum of an ether, like that of an alcohol or a 
phenol, exhibits a very strong C — O band in the fingerprint region of the spec- 
trum but hydroxyl absorption is, of course, absent. Carboxylic acids and esters 
also show C — O stretching bands, but additionally exhibit strong carbonyl 
absorption. The most distinguishing feature of dialkyl ethers is a very strong 
band at 1150-1060cm -1 (asymmetric C — O stretching) which is seen at 
1 120 cm - 1 in the spectrum of dibutyl ether (Fig. 3.24). Like the C — O stretching

bands in alcohols, the ether C — O — C bands are complex in origin and involve 
strong coupling with other vibrations in the molecule. In dialkyl ethers the sym- 
metric vibration is usually very weak and only the asymmetric stretching band is 
observed. The spectra of aralkyl ethers exhibit a band at 1270-1 230 cm -1 , 
attributed to the C — O — C asymmetric stretching vibration and also a band at 
1075-1020 cm -1 arising from the symmetric C — O — C vibration. The high fre- 
quency band may be considered to be the aromatic C — O stretching band since 
it is the only one observed (at 1 240 cm - 1 ) in diphenyl ether. Strong absorption 
in this high frequency region is also observed with vinyl ethers. One of the 
reasons for the higher absorption frequency of the aryl-oxygen bond is the 
strengthening of the bond by resonance. The two bands can be identified in the 
spectrum of anisole (Fig. 3.25) at 1240cm -1 and 1040cm -1 . 

The correlation tables for ethers and cyclic ethers are in Appendix 2, Table 
A2.6. 

Amines. In dilute solution primary amines show two absorption bands, one 
near 3500 cm - 1 and the other near 3400 cm - \ arising from the asymmetric and 
symmetric stretching vibrations of the two NH bonds (cf. the vibrations of a 
methylene group, Fig. 3.1). Secondary amines show just one band near 
3300 cm - ' due to the single N — H stretching vibration, while tertiary amines do 
not absorb in this region. These characteristic absorptions allow one to dis-

SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.1 



tinguish readily between the three classes of amines. Imines also show a single 
band in the 3500-3200 cm -1 region. The bands are shifted to lower frequencies 
in the condensed phase as a result of hydrogen bonding which is, however, much 
weaker than in hydroxyl compounds because of the lower electronegativity of 
nitrogen. Because of the weaker hydrogen bonding this frequency shift is not so 
great and the absorption bands tend to be appreciably narrower than the corres- 
ponding bonded OH absorption bands. Aromatic primary and secondary 
amines absorb at slightly higher frequencies than the corresponding aliphatic 
amines, and the separation between the symmetric and asymmetric stretching 
bands in the aromatic primary amines is greater; these spectral differences have 
been rationalised on the basis of interaction of the lone electron pair on the 
nitrogen atom with the aromatic ring in arylamines resulting in a shorter, 
stronger, bond. 

A medium to strong broad band in the 1650-1590 cm -1 region is characteris- 
tic of aliphatic primary amines and arises from the NH 2 scissoring vibration; 
additionally these amines show a medium-strong, broad, multiple absorption 
band at 850-750 cm -1 arising from NH 2 twisting and wagging deformations. 
These absorptions are clearly seen in the spectrum of butylamine (Fig. 3.26), 
which also shows the characteristic rather broad hydrogen bonded NH 2 stretch- 
ing band as a closely spaced doublet at 3350cm -1 . 

In aliphatic secondary amines the N — H bending band is usually absent from 
the spectrum or else it is very weak and appears at 1650- 1550 cm - '. In aromatic 
secondary amines the band is of medium intensity, and appears in the same 
region, but the assignment is complicated by the presence of aromatic ring 
vibrations which also occur here, and which are sometimes intensified when a 
nitrogen atom is attached to the ring. 

Carbon-nitrogen stretching vibrations in aliphatic amines occur in the 1 190- 
1020 cm -1 region of the spectrum, and the exact position of the band has been 
correlated with the nature of the amino group and the degree of branching at the 
a-carbon atom. In butylamine, Fig. 3.26, this vibration is observed as a band of 
medium intensity at 1080 cm -1 , the region expected for an aliphatic amino com- 
pound with a primary a-carbon atom. The C — N stretching band is also present 
in aromatic amines and appears as a medium-strong absorption at somewhat 
higher frequency, i.e. 1360-1250 cm -1 , as a result of the increased strength of the 
bond in aromatic amines; the position of the absorption is dependent on the 
nature of the amine. Secondary aromatic amines for example exhibit a strong 
band in the 1350-1280 cm -1 region, as in the spectrum of iV-methylaniline, Fig. 
3.27. Unfortunately although these aromatic C — N bands appear within fairly 
constant frequency ranges for the primary, secondary and tertiary amines these 
ranges overlap and unambiguous identification is not possible. Nevertheless, as 
in the case of iV-methylaniline, for example, the appearance of the band in the 
appropriate C — N stretching region in association with the sharp absorption 
near 3400 cm ~ 1 can be taken as definitive evidence for the presence of a second-

3.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The correlation tables for amines and amine salts are in Appendix 2, Table 

A2.7. 

Compounds containing the carbonyl group. The carbonyl group gives rise to an 
intense band in the 1900-1560 cm -1 region of the spectrum. With the aid of 
other absorption bands the identification of the particular functional group is 
possible (i.e. whether it is a ketone, aldehyde, ester, amide, etc.). Furthermore, 
from the position of the absorption frequency it is possible to extract a consider- 
able amount of information about the environment of the carbonyl group in the 
molecule. 

As a reference, the position of absorption of the carbonyl group in a saturated 
acyclic ketone which occurs at 1720 cm -1 is regarded as the 'normal' frequency. 
Deviation from this absorption position may be correlated with the influence of 
electronic and steric effects which arise from the nature of the substituents 
(R and X) attached to the carbonyl group.

(a) (b) (c) 

These effects may be broadly summarised thus; a more detailed consideration of 
specific cases is exemplified under each functional group type. 

1. Inductive effects. When X is an electron-attracting group (e.g. CI) the contribu- 

tion to the mesomeric hybrid of the polar forms (b) and (c) will be lower, and 
this will result in a stronger, shorter carbonyl-oxygen bond because of the in- 
creased importance of the form (a). There will thus be a consequent increase 
in the frequency of absorption. 

2. Mesomeric effects. When X is a group which can effectively conjugate with the 
carbonyl group, either by virtue of lone electron pairs or 7i-electrons, the 
direction and magnitude of the frequency shift is related to the balance 
between such electron delocalisation and any accompanying inductive effects. 

If X is a carbon-carbon unsaturated bond (and inductive effects are vir- 
tually absent) the contribution of (c) to the mesomeric hybrid is greatly in- 
creased, and this results in the carbonyl bond having less double bond 
character, with a consequent decrease in the frequency of absorption. Inspec- 
tion of the correlation tables (Appendix 2, Table A2.8) clearly shows the effect 
of such conjugation in a,/?-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones, and aromatic 
aldehydes and ketones. 

The instances when X is either — NH 2 or — OR offer interesting compari- 
son. Thus in amides the mesomeric effect of the nitrogen lone pair is more im- 
portant than the inductive effect of the nitrogen, and this leads to a decrease 
in the frequency of carbonyl absorption. In esters, on the other hand, the in- 
ductive effect of the oxygen (which is more electronegative than nitrogen) is 
the more important and this results in an increase in the frequency of car- 
bonyl absorption. This opposite frequency shift observed with amides and 
esters, arising from the different balance between the relative importance of 
mesomeric and inductive effects is consistent with the relative chemical reac- 
tivity which these two groups exhibit.

3. Bond angle effects. When the carbonyl-carbon is part of a ring system contain- 
ing 3, 4 or 5 carbon atoms, the decrease in the bond angle of the two sp 2 - 
hybridised orbitals results in steric strain effects which cause the frequency of 
absorption of the carbonyl group to be shifted to higher values. 

The correlation tables for compounds containing the carbonyl group are in 
Appendix 2, Table A2.8. 

Ketones. Normal acyclic ketones can be recognised by a strong band at 
1720 cm - 1 (e.g. see the spectrum of 4-methylpentan-2-one, Fig. 3.28). Branching 
at the a-carbon atoms results in an increase in the C — CO — C bond angle and 
this results in a decrease in frequency of absorption from the normal value of 
1720 cm -1 to, for example, 1697 cm -1 as in di-t-butylketone. Conversely as the 
C — CO — C bond angle is decreased the absorption frequency rises, thus cyclo- 
pentanone and cyclobutanone absorb at 1750 cm -1 and 1775 cm - 1 respectively. 
Conjugation of a carbonyl group with a C=C linkage results in a lowering of 
the frequency of absorption as a result of the decreased double bond character of 
the carbonyl group. An aliphatic C=C bond in conjugation with a carbonyl 
group reduces its frequency by about 40 cm -1 to a value of 1680 cm "^conjuga- 
tion with acetylenic bonds produces comparable shifts. Most a,/?-unsaturated 
acyclic ketones can exist in two conformations, the s-cis and the s-trans forms, 
and two carbonyl absorption bands are shown in compounds of this type. Thus 
methyl vinyl ketone absorbs at 1716 and 1686cm -1 , and it is assumed that the 
lower frequency band is due to the trans form in which electron delocalisation is 
expected to be more effective. The effects of conjugation and ring size are addit- 
ive and may be used to predict the positions of absorption in more complex 
compounds.

Conjugation with an aryl group shifts the frequency to 1715-1695 cm -1 ; aceto- 
phenone itself absorbs at 1692 cm - 1 (Fig. 3.9). The band position is dependent 
also on the nature and position of any ring substituents. 

Introduction of a halogen on the a-carbon atom of a ketone leads to a shift to 
higher frequency provided that the halogen can rotate to eclipse the carbonyl 
group. The frequency of carbonyl absorption is unaffected by the presence of 
further halogens on the a-carbon but it can, however, be increased by further 
substitution on the a'-carbon atom. The magnitude of these frequency shifts in- 
creases in the order Br, CI, F and there is no doubt that the shifts arise from a 
field effect. The cis-trans isomers of 4-t-butylchlorocyclohexanone can be dis- 
tinguished in this way. In the preferred conformation of the cis isomer the car- 
bonyl group and the equatorial halogen are eclipsed, resulting in an increase of 
the frequency of absorption of the carbonyl group. On the other hand, in the 
preferred conformation of the trans isomer the halogen is axial and the absorp- 
tion frequency of the carbonyl group in this case is similar to 4-t-butylcyclohexa- 
none.

Aldehydes. The carbonyl group in saturated aldehydes absorbs at slightly 
higher frequencies, 1740-1730 cm -1 , than are observed in saturated ketones. As 
expected, a,/?-unsaturation, or attachment of the carbonyl carbon to an aroma- 
tic ring, causes a shift of absorption to lower frequencies; aromatic aldehydes 
generally absorb near 1715-1695 cm -1 . Special structural features can, however, 
cause a large frequency shift of the carbonyl absorption, as in salicylaldehyde, 
where internal (chelated) hydrogen bonding results in absorption at 1666cm -1 . 




Aldehydes can readily be distinguished from ketones by means of aldehydic 
C — H stretching absorption, which results in two weak bands near 2820 cm -1 
and 2720 cm -1 . The appearance of two bands, rather than one, is due to Fermi 
resonance between the fundamental aldehyde C — H stretching vibration, and 
the first overtone of the aldehyde C — H deformation band (at 975-780 cm -1 ). 
The higher frequency band is frequently not observed in the spectrum of alipha- 
tic aldehydes because of masking by strong saturated C — H stretching vibra- 
tions in this region. The 2720 cm -1 band can normally be seen, however, as in 
the spectrum of cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde (Fig. 3.29). Both the bands are 
visible in the spectrum of anisaldehyde (Fig. 3.30), which has only weak C — H 
absorption arising from the OCH 3 group in this region; note also the lower fre- 
quency ( 1 690 cm - 1 ) of the C=0 band in this case compared with cyclohexane- 
carboxaldehyde. 

Carboxylk acids. Even in quite dilute solution in non-polar solvents, acids exist 
essentially as dimeric species, which may be readily explained on the basis of the 
electronic structure of the carboxyl group. Powerful hydrogen bonding between 
the molecules, and the strength of these bonds, has been accounted for on the 
basis of a large contribution of an ionic resonance structure.

As a consequence, the spectrum of a carboxylic acid in the condensed phase 
(KBr disc, a mull or liquid film), or in concentrated solution, exhibits absorption 
due to dimeric species and even in very dilute solution only a small proportion 
of the monomer is present. Under these sample conditions the C=0 stretching 
band appears at 1725-1700 cm -1 for saturated acyclic carboxylic acids, but is

shifted to lower frequencies (by about 20-30 cm -1 ) when conjugated with a 
double bond or an aromatic ring. The intensity of the absorption is generally 
greater than that of ketones. Some acids are capable of forming internal hydro- 
gen bonds and the carbonyl frequency is shifted much more significantly; thus 
salicylic acids absorbs at 1655 cm -1 . 

The feature which enables one to distinguish a carboxylic acid from all the 
other carbonyl compounds, however, is a broad absorption band which extends 
from 3300 cm -1 to 2500cm -1 . This band is the result of the strongly hydrogen 
bonded O — H stretching vibrations, and can be seen in the spectrum of hex- 
anoic acid (Fig. 3.31). The aliphatic C — H stretching bands generally appear as a 
jagged peak near 2900 cm - 1 superimposed on top of the bonded O — H band, 
which itself has an intensity maximum in this region. 

Another band characteristic of the dimeric acid species arises from the O — H 
out-of-plane deformation (wag) vibration which appears as a broad, rather 
weak, band at 950-900 cm - 1 and is seen in the spectrum of hexanoic acid; its 
maximum intensity is at about 940 cm -1 . 

Other bands which assist in the identification of carboxyl groups are the 
coupled vibrations involving the C — O stretching and O — H in-plane deforma- 
tion vibrations, and these absorb at 1440-1395 cm -1 (weak) and 1320- 
121 1 cm - 1 (strong). Neither can be specifically assigned, but because of the simi- 
larity of the 1300 cm -1 band with the strong absorption at this frequency 
exhibited by esters, it is usually referred to as the C — O stretching band. A small 
band near 2700cm -1 , which is superimposed upon the broad bonded O — H 
stretching band, is believed to be a combination band arising from the C — O 
stretching and O — H deformation vibrations. 

Salts of carboxylic acids do not, of course, show a carbonyl band. Instead 
strong bands due to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the 
equivalent carbon-oxygen bonds are observed at 1610-1550cm -1 and 1420- 
1300 cm -1 respectively, and can provide evidence for the presence of the carb- 
oxylate anion. 

Esters and lactones. Esters show two characteristic absorption regions arising 
from 0=0 and C — O stretching vibrations. The carbonyl stretching frequency 
in saturated acyclic esters appears at a slightly higher frequency (20-30 cm -1 ) 
than that in simple ketones; this is a consequence of the inductive effect of the 
electronegative alkoxy-oxygen exerting an electron withdrawal effect on the car- 
bonyl carbon resulting in a shorter and stronger carbonyl bond. Sometimes a 
problem in structural assignment arises because the frequency ranges can over- 
lap; for example, ester carbonyl frequency is lowered by conjugation or a ketone 
carbonyl absorption shifted to higher frequency by a chlorine attached to an 
adjacent carbon. In general the effect of environmental changes on the position 
of absorption of the carbonyl group in esters, e.g. the effect of conjugation, etc., 
follows the same pattern as in ketones. Six- five- and four-membered ring lac- 
tones absorb near 1750, 1780 and 1820 cm -1 respectively. Phenyl and vinyl 
esters, which have the — CO — O — C=C bonding system, absorb at higher fre- 
quencies (20-25 cm -1 ) than the saturated esters. 

The C — O stretching vibration in esters results in very strong bands in the 
1300-1 100 cm - 1 region. The band is of complex origin, but is generally regarded 
as arising mainly from the acyl-oxygen bond. Unfortunately its diagnostic use is 
rather limited since other strong bands, e.g. ether C — O stretching, also appear

in this region. However, it has been shown that simple esters such as formates, 
acetates and butyrates all show a strong band near 1200cm - *. The spectrum of 
phenyl acetate (Fig. 3.32) and that of butyl acetate (Fig. 3.33) are illustrative of 
this class of compounds. 

Anhydrides. All acid anhydrides show two strong absorption bands at the 
higher frequency end of the C=0 stretching region; they occur near 1 800 cm - 1 
and 1750 cm -1 , and they are almost always c. 60 cm -1 apart. The higher fre- 
quency band is due to the symmetric C=0 stretching vibration, and in open 
chain anhydrides it is always of higher intensity than the lower frequency band 
arising from asymmetric vibrations. Conversely in cyclic anhydrides the high 
frequency band is always the weaker of the two and it diminishes in intensity 
with increasing ring strain, i.e. a five-membered ring anhydride exhibits a weaker 
high frequency absorption band than a six-membered ring anhydride. This effect 
has been explained on the basis of a decreased dipole moment change in the 
symmetric vibrational mode when constrained in a cyclic system. 

Open chain and cyclic anhydrides also show a strong band in the 1170— 
1050cm -1 and 1300-1 200 cm -1 regions respectively, arising from a C — O — C 
stretching vibration. However, since many other groups give strong bands in 
these regions this assignment is of limited diagnostic value; nevertheless the ab- 
sence of an anhydride group is confirmed if there is no strong absorption in 
either of these regions. 

The typical features of an open chain anhydride are shown in the spectrum of 
acetic anhydride (Fig. 3.34). It is also worth noting in this spectrum the very 
weak C — H stretching band for the methyl group, and the much enhanced in- 
tensity of the symmetric C — H bending mode when attached to a carbonyl 
group. 

Acid halides. Acid halides show a strong C=0 stretching absorption band at 
the high frequency end of the carbonyl stretching region. This may be explained 
by considering the electronic structure of an acid chloride.

(a) (b) 

The dominant inductive effect of chlorine will tend to draw electron density 
away from the carbonyl oxygen resulting in a smaller contribution of the polar 
form (b) compared to that of ketones. The carbonyl bond will thus be shorter 
and stronger and hence will absorb at a higher frequency; acetyl chloride ab- 
sorbs at 1 802 cm - 1 (cf. acetone, 1 725 cm - 1 ). Conjugation of the carbonyl group 
with an a,/?-double bond or an aryl group would be expected to lower the C=0 
stretching frequency and this is observed. Thus benzoyl chloride absorbs at 
1773 cm -1 ; it also shows a slightly weaker band at 1736 cm -1 due to Fermi 
resonance arising from the C=0 group and the overtone of a lower frequency 
absorption band. 

Amides. All amides are characterised by a strong carbonyl absorption band, 
referred to as the 'amide I' band. Primary and secondary amides additionally 
show bands arising from N — H stretching and bending vibrations. The N — H

bending absorption is generally at slightly lower frequency than the carbonyl 
absorption and is referred to as the 'amide IF band. 

Amides have a very strong tendency to self-associate by hydrogen bonding, 
and the appearance of the spectrum is very much dependent on the physical 
state of the sample. Considerable shifts in band positions can occur on passing 
from a dilute solution to a solid, thus N — H and C=0 stretching bands show a 
marked shift to lower frequency while the N — H bending (amide II) band moves 
to higher frequency. 

In dilute solution primary amides show two sharp bands resulting from the 
asymmetric and symmetric N — H stretching vibrations near 3520 cm -1 and 
3400 cm -1 (the normal N — H region). In solid samples these appear near 
3350cm -1 and 3180cm -1 . In dilute solution secondary amides show only one 
band near 3460-3420 cm - 1 on low-resolution instruments. However, under 
conditions of high resolution the band can frequently be split into two com- 
ponents which have been assigned to the cis and trans rotational isomers. 

As a consequence of the mesomeric effect, the amide carbonyl group has less 
double bond character than that of a normal ketonic carbonyl group and it 
would be expected to absorb at lower frequency. This is found to be the case; 
primary and secondary amides absorb strongly near 1690 cm -1 in dilute solu- 
tion and at somewhat lower frequency in the solid phase. Tertiary amides are 
not affected by hydrogen bonding and show strong absorption at 1670- 
1630 cm -1 irrespective of the physical state of the sample. 

Bands resulting from the primary and secondary N — H bending vibrations 
appear near 1650 cm -1 and 1550 cm -1 respectively in the solid phase, and the 
large difference in these amide II bands enables primary and secondary amides 
to be distinguished. The 1550 cm -1 band is not a simple N — H bending mode, 
but is believed to result from coupling of this deformation with a C — N stretch- 
ing vibration. 

Other mixed vibration bands known as the amide III, IV and V bands have 
been identified in various regions of the spectrum but they are of limited diag- 
nostic value. 

The amide II band is not present in the spectra of lactams. As in the case of 
cyclic ketones, however, the carbonyl (amide I) band shifts to higher frequency 
as the size of the ring decreases. 

The spectrum of benzamide (Fig. 3.35) is typical of an aromatic primary 
amide. 

Amino acids. a-Amino acids (and other amino acids also) normally exist as 
zwitterionic salts (e.g. (1)), and therefore show bands characteristic of the ionised 
carboxyl group and an amine salt. Hence there is no absorption corresponding 
to the normal stretching vibrations as exhibited by an amine, but instead a com- 
plex series of bands is observed between 3130 and 2500 cm -1 , and this is also the 

e 
case for the hydrochloride salts of amino acids (e.g. (2)). In addition to — NH 3 
stretching vibrations (cf. CH 3 and CH 2 stretching bands), combination and 
overtone vibrations of the various N — H bending modes are involved, and the 
very complexity of a spectrum in this region of the spectrum is a useful indica- 
tion that the compound is an amino acid. 

e 
For iV-substituted compounds, such as proline, only the — NH 2 stretching vi- 
brations are involved and these appear at lower frequency. A relatively promin-

ent band between 2200 and 2000 cm - 1 is found in the spectrum of most amino 
acids and their hydrochloride salts and can be clearly seen in the spectrum of 
(±)-valine (Fig. 3.36) at 2130cm -1 . The band appears at this position in all 
a-amino acids, but is displaced in others (i.e. /?, y, etc.) and is believed to be a 
combination band associated with the C0 2 e group. The salts derived from 
amino acids and bases (e.g. (3)) show normal N — H stretching bands.

In the amino acid hydrochloride salts, normal carbonyl absorption is observed 
for the — C0 2 H group except that the band is displaced by about 20 cm -1 to 

e 
higher frequency by the electron attracting — NH 3 group, which has the effect of 
making the C=0 group shorter and stronger. In contrast the ionised carboxyl 
group in the zwitterionic and basic salt forms, like the salts of carboxylic acids, 
shows absorption bands due to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations 




of the — Ql f group, and these appear at 1550cm * and 1410cm 1 re- 
spectively. 

The more complex a-amino acids additionally show characteristic bands 
which aid in their identification. Thus in the spectrum of L-tryptophan (Fig. 
3.37) the N — H stretching vibration, and the out-of-plane hydrogen wag 
deformation which appears at 742 cm -1 (four adjacent hydrogens), readily 
allow it to be distinguished from other a-amino acids. 

The correlation tables for amino acids and amine salts are in Appendix 2, 
Table A2.9. 

Nitro compounds, nitroso compounds and nitrites. Nitro compounds. These ex- 
hibit two very intense absorption bands in the 1560-1500cm -1 and 1350- 
1300 cm -1 region of the spectrum arising from asymmetric and symmetric 
stretching vibrations of the highly polar nitrogen-oxygen bonds. Aromatic nitro 
compounds show bands at slightly lower frequencies than the aliphatic com- 
pounds as a result of conjugation of the nitro group with the aromatic ring, 
which slightly weakens the nitrogen-oxygen bonds. The spectrum of nitro- 
benzene (Fig. 3.38) is typical of this class of compound. Note that for this com- 
pound the positions of the out-of-plane hydrogen wagging bands in the 900- 
700 cm -1 region of the spectrum are not characteristic of a monosubstituted 
benzene system as the result of the presence of the nitro group, and the substitu- 
tion pattern cannot be determined reliably. 

Nitroso compounds. These compounds may be of the C — NO or N — NO type. 
Tertiary C-nitroso compounds tend to dimerise, and secondary and primary C- 
nitroso compounds readily rearrange to oximes. In the monomeric state they

compounds show a band near 1450 cm -1 in solution in carbon tetrachloride.

sorb in the 2300-2000 cm - 1 region of the spectrum. Stretching of the C=N 
bond in aliphatic nitriles gives rise to a band at 2260-2240 cm - 1 , which is shifted 
to lower frequency by conjugation with a double bond or aromatic ring. Conju- 
gation also tends to increase the intensity of the band which is very strong in, for 
example, benzonitrile (Fig. 3.39). The various types of nitriles do, however, show 
marked variations in the intensity of the bands depending on the electronic 
effects of substituents attached to the nitrile group; thus any substituent which 
tends to diminish the dipole moment of the bond would be expected to produce 
a decrease in the intensity and vice versa. Isocyanates show a very intense 
absorption band near 2275-2240 cm - 1 which is unaltered by conjugation. The 
bands are very much more intense than the bands of nitriles with similar struc- 
ture and this feature allows them to be readily distinguished. 

Oximes and imines. A band of variable intensity arising from stretching of the 
C=N bond in oximes and imines occurs in the 1690-1 590 cm -1 region of the 
spectrum, and is generally more intense than C=C stretching bands which also 
appear here. The oximes additionally show a band for the O — H stretching 
vibration near 3200cm -1 . 

Azo compounds. These compounds exhibit stretching of the — N=N — bond 
giving rise to only weak absorption near 1600 cm -1 , which is shifted to lower 
frequency by conjugation. In aromatic compounds the band is generally masked 
by the aromatic ring breathing vibrations. 

The correlation tables for unsaturated nitrogen compounds are in Appendix 
2, Table A2. 11. 

Organo-sulphur compounds. Thiols. The S — H stretching vibration of thiols 
gives rise to a weak band at 2590-2550 cm - 1 . Unlike the O — H stretching band 
in the alcohols, the position of this band is little affected by hydrogen-bonding 
effects, and the absorption exhibited by neat liquid films and by dilute solutions 
of a thiol are similar. Although the band is weak it has diagnostic value as few 
other bands appear in this region of the spectrum, though it may well be masked 
if there is also a carboxyl group in the molecule. 

Thioketones and dithioesters. These show C=S stretching bands in the 1 270- 
1 1 90 cm - 1 region. Since the C=S bond is not as polar or as strong as the C=0 
bond the absorption band is not very intense and appears in the low frequency

region of the spectrum; coupling with other bands in this region can make iden- 
tification difficult. 

Sulphoxides. The S=0 bond is highly polar and gives rise to a strong absorp- 
tion near 1050 cm - 1 which can be readily recognised. The position of the band is 
little affected by attached double bonds or aromatic rings as conjugation of the 
S=0 bond and an adjacent 71-electron system is not extensive; however, electro- 
negative substituents cause a shift to higher frequency which may be explained 
in terms of a reduced contribution by the polar S — O structure to the resonance 
hybrid with a consequent increase in S=0 character giving a stronger bond. 

Sulphones, sulphonamides, sulphonyl chlorides, sulphonic acids, sulphonates and 
organic sulphates. These all contain the S0 2 group which can be readily identi- 
fied by the appearance of two strong bands in the 1415-1300 cm -1 and 1200- 
1120cm -1 regions, due to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations 
respectively. Occasionally the high frequency sulphone band will split when the 
spectrum is recorded in carbon tetrachloride solution or the solid state. 
Sulphonic acids may be further recognised by the broad hydrogen bonded 
O — H stretching absorption centred at ~ 3000 cm -1 . Primary and secondary 
sulphonamides will show two or one N — H stretching bands respectively near 
3300 cm -1 (cf. the spectrum of toluene-p-sulphonamide, Fig. 3.40). 

The correlation table for organo-sulphur compounds is in Appendix 2, Table 
A2.12. 

Halogen compounds. The C — X stretching vibration gives rise to very strong 
absorption in the low frequency region of the spectrum. Indeed, absorption by 
C — I and many C — Br bonds occurs outside the range available on many 
routine instruments. Monofluoroalkanes normally absorb in the 1100- 
1000 cm -1 region; splitting of the band and a shift to higher frequencies occurs 
on further substitution, while highly fluorinated aliphatic compounds show a 
series of intense bands in the 1400-1000 cm -1 region. Monochloroalkanes and 
monobromoalkanes absorb in the 760-540 cm -1 and 600-500 cm -1 regions re- 
spectively. Axial and equatorial chlorine, and also bromine, in cyclohexanes and 
steroids, may be differentiated since the equatorial C — X bond absorbs at a 
higher frequency. 

The correlation table for halogen compounds is in Appendix 2, Table A2.13. 



3.2 NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY 

Nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) spectroscopy has become a powerful tool 
for the organic chemist since instruments became easily available in the late 
1950s, and developments in instrumentation in the last decade have extended 
the usefulness of the technique. 33 -g 

The technique is only applicable to those nuclei which possess a spin quan- 
tum number (J) greater than zero. The most important of such nuclei as far as 
the organic chemist is concerned are X H and 13 C, both of which have a spin 
quantum number of \. Other nuclei with non-zero spin quantum numbers are 
19 F and 31 P, with I = i; 14 N and 2 D, with / = 1; and n B and 35 C1, with 1 = 1 
All of these have been extensively studied by n.m.r. spectroscopy. Nuclei with 
non-zero spin quantum numbers can be thought of as tiny spinning bar

magnets. This spinning magnetic field creates a magnetic dipole, the magnitude 
of which is given by the nuclear magnetic moment fi. 1 H and 19 F have relatively 
large magnetic moments and are relatively easily studied by n.m.r. spectroscopy. 
13 C has a much smaller magnetic moment which has meant that until relatively 
recently, with the introduction of new instrumental techniques, the 1 3 C nucleus 
was not easily studied by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In the 
absence of an applied magnetic field the nuclei are randomly orientated. When 
the nuclei are placed in a magnetic field they align themselves in relation to the 
applied field. The number of orientations which the nucleus can adopt is limited 
by the spin quantum number and is equal to 21 + 1. Thus those nuclei with J = 
i have two possible orientations in the magnetic field (+j and — -J). The two 
orientations are associated with different energy levels, orientation against the 
magnetic field being of higher energy and thus having a lower population. The 
difference in energy between the two spin states is dependent on the magnitude 
of the applied magnetic field and the nuclear magnetic moment. The frequency 
of radiation necessary to effect a transition between the two energy levels is 
given by the equation: 

fiB 

where v is the frequency of radiation, n is the magnetic moment of the nucleus, 
B is the strength of the external magnetic field, h is Planck's constant, and J is 
the spin quantum number. Thus the larger the applied magnetic field the greater 
the energy difference between the two levels and the greater the frequency of 
radiation necessary to effect the transition between the two levels. For the 
proton, an applied magnetic field of 1.4 tesla (T) requires a frequency of 60 
megahertz (MHz) to effect a transition; a field of 2.3 T requires a frequency of 
100 MHz. For 13 C, the frequencies of radiation required for these magnetic 
fields (1.4 and 2.3 T) are 15.1 and 25.1 MHz respectively. The powerful super- 
conducting magnets now available require frequencies up to 500 MHz. 

The basis of the n.m.r experiment is to subject the nuclei to radiation which 
will result in a transition from the lower energy state to the higher one. The value 
of n.m.r. spectroscopy to the organic chemist is that the precise difference in 
energy levels between the two spin orientations is dependent on the particular 
location of the atom in the molecule. This is because each nucleus is subject to 
the differing effects of the magnetic fields of neighbouring nuclei. Only nuclei 
which are in exactly the same magnetic environment will have exactly the same 
energy difference between spin orientations when placed in a magnetic field. In 
n.m.r. spectroscopy these differences in energy are detected and provide 
information on the variety of locations of the nuclei in the molecule. The 
13 C-n.m.r. spectrum of ethanol (Fig. 3.50) provides a useful illustration. The 
spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the two types of atoms present, the 
carbon in the methyl group and that in the methylene group. The local magnetic 
environment of these two nuclei is clearly different. The methylene carbon is 
bonded to one oxygen, one carbon and two hydrogen atoms whereas the methyl 
carbon is bonded to one other carbon and three hydrogens. This means that the 
difference between the upper and lower spin states of the two atoms in the n.m.r 
spectrophotometer is not precisely the same, and they therefore absorb radi- 
ation at slightly different frequencies. 

The n.m.r experiment is carried out by placing the compound in solution in a 

318 



SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.2 



glass tube (typically 0.5 mm diameter) between the poles of a magnet. The tube is 
spun rapidly to minimise any magnetic anisotropy. The sample is subject to 
irradiation at radiofrequency and the absorption of radiation is detected. There 
are two methods by which this process is carried out. Until relatively recently, 
the most common method was to modify the magnetic field very slightly over 
time while holding the radiofrequency constant and to detect absorption of radi- 
ation as the field varied (field sweep). This is easier to achieve than to hold the 
field constant and to vary the radiofrequency (frequency sweep). Since the field is 
directly proportional to the radiofrequency required for transition, the result 
could be represented as a spectrum of absorption against frequency. This is Con- 
tinuous Wave nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CW-n.m.r.) and many 
instruments operating on this principle are still in use. The Continuous Wave 
method has proved satisfactory for many routine uses but it has a number of 
limitations. One is the time taken to run the spectrum and the consequent limi- 
tation on accumulating large numbers of spectra on the same sample. In the case 
of 13 C where the isotope constitutes only 1.1 per cent of the carbon nuclei, many 
accumulated scans are required in order to produce a spectrum in which the 
absorption peaks can be readily distinguished from background noise. 

An alternative technique which has been developed more recently is to irradi- 
ate the sample with all radiofrequencies in the desired range (i.e. covering all 1 H 
absorption frequencies or all 13 C frequencies) at once, while holding the mag- 
netic field constant. This causes all the protons or all the carbon nuclei to absorb 
at their individual frequencies. The interaction of all the frequencies results in an 
interferogram which is of no direct value for interpretation. It is converted by 
Fourier Transform to a spectrum showing absorption against frequency. The 
technique is known as pulsed-Fourier Transform nuclear magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy, often abbreviated to FT-n.m.r. The pulses of radiation are very 
short lived, usually about 20 microseconds (^s). The excited nuclei then emit 
radiation on falling back to the ground state. The pulse cannot be repeated until 
there is a sufficient population in the ground state once again, otherwise no radi- 
ation will be absorbed. When there is no longer an excess of nuclei in the ground 
state the compound is said to be saturated, and the phenomenon is known as 
saturation. (This phenomenon can occur in the Continuous Wave method when 
very slow scan speeds are used.) The process of returning to the ground state is 
known as relaxation, which can occur by a number of mechanisms. The rate of 
return to the ground state is characterised by the relaxation time. In pulsed FT- 
n.m.r. pulses are repeated frequently (0.1-1 s, the acquisition time) depending on 
the relaxation time of the nucleus, which allows a large number of spectra to be 
recorded and stored in the instrument's computer in the space of a few minutes. 
Thus it is possible by this technique to obtain good spectra of nuclei such as 13 C 
which are present naturally in low abundance and which have relatively small 
nuclear magnetic moments. It also allows n.m.r. spectra to be obtained with very 
much smaller samples (down to about 5 ^g) than is possible with Continuous 
Wave instruments. 

FEATURES OF A NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTRUM 

The two types of spectra most frequently encountered by the organic chemist are 
13 C and 1 H spectra. Considerably greater sensitivity is required for 13 C than for 
1 H due to the low natural abundance of 13 C and the lower magnetic moment 
compared to that of the proton. However, greater resolution is possible with 

319 



3.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



13 C. This is illustrated by the X H and 13 C spectra of 3-methylheptane shown in 
Fig. 3.41. The proton spectrum only distinguishes between the methyl and meth- 
ine protons, whereas the 1 3 C spectrum shows seven distinct peaks. However, the 
two types of spectra have many features in common which may be illustrated by 
an examination of the 1 H and 13 C spectra of toluene, Fig. 3.42 and Fig. 3.43 re- 
spectively. 

By convention, frequency, and therefore magnetic field strength, increase 
from left to right in the n.m.r. spectrum. Thus moving from left to right is upfield 
and moving from right to left is downfield. Upfield absorptions are said to be 
more shielded, downfield absorptions are deshielded. The position of an absorp- 
tion in the n.m.r. spectrum may be represented either on a frequency scale (Hz), 
or on a scale of magnetic field (tesla), and again by convention the frequency 
scale is used. In typical n.m.r. spectra the differences in the positions of absorp- 
tion are usually small compared to the absolute value of the frequency which is 
around 10 7 Hz. In the case of X H spectra the differences are of the order of a few 
hundred Hz and for 13 C they are a few thousand Hz. The position of an absorp- 
tion in the n.m.r. spectrum is therefore denoted, not by the absolute frequency 
value, but by its relationship to the absorption frequency of a reference com- 
pound, i.e. Hz upfield or downfield from the reference. The normal reference 
compound for both 13 C and 1 H spectra is tetramethylsilane [(CH 3 ) 4 Si, TMS]. 
All the protons in TMS are equivalent, and the proton nuclei in the vast major- 
ity of organic compounds absorb downfield from the single TMS signal. Simi- 
larly the vast majority of 13 C nuclei in organic compounds absorb downfield 
from the carbon absorption in TMS. Since tetramethylsilane is not soluble in

water, the soluble sodium salt of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulphonic acid 
(DSS, Tiers salt) is normally used in aqueous solution. 

The TMS absorption in the 60 MHz proton spectrum of toluene (Fig. 3.42) is 
indicated and this is the reference point (0 Hz) for all absorptions in the spec- 
trum. The spectrum shows two absorptions which appear at 128 Hz and 419 Hz 
downfield from TMS. If the spectrum of toluene is recorded on an instrument 
operating at 100 MHz their absorptions occur at 213 Hz and 698 Hz respect- 
ively. In order to make direct and rapid comparisons between spectra recorded 
on instruments operating at different frequencies, the positions of absorptions 
are normally quoted on the S scale which is independent of the instrument oper- 
ating frequency. The 6 value is obtained by dividing the position in Hz by the 
instrument frequency (in MHz) and is expressed in parts per million (p.p.m.). 
Thus for toluene the two absorptions appear at &lt;5 2.13 (128/60 or 213/100) and 
6 6.98 (419/60 or 698/100). The chart paper normally used for recording spectra 
is calibrated in 6 values and therefore this calculation is not usually necessary, 
but it is often needed to determine the position of absorptions which have been 
offset (see Fig. 3.47). The S value may relate to any reference compound and 
therefore the particular reference used (e.g. TMS) must be quoted. Earlier litera- 
ture used the similar t scale; this related solely to TMS which was given a value 
of 10. The two scales can be readily interconverted since t = 10 — 6. 

The 67.8 MHz 13 C spectrum of toluene (Fig. 3.43) is also recorded on chart 



322 



SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.2 



paper calibrated in 3 values. In this case the reference point (3 0) is the carbon 
absorption of TMS. 13 C nuclei in most organic compounds appear within the 
range of 250 p. p.m. downfield from TMS. The spectrum of toluene shows five 
absorptions at 137.5, 128.9, 128.1, 125.2 and 21.1. The spectrum was recorded as 
a solution in CDC1 3 . The three peaks centred at about 3 77 are due to the carbon 
atom in the solvent coupling with the adjacent deuterium. 

It is usual for the p.m.r. absorption spectrum to be accompanied by an integ- 
ration curve. This normally appears above the absorption curve on the chart 
and consists of a series of steps, each step being related to a particular absorp- 
tion. The height of each step is a measure of the area under each absorption 
peak, and this in turn is a measure of the relative number of proton nuclei giving 
rise to that absorption. Thus the ratios of the heights of the steps on the integ- 
ration curve gives the ratio of the different types of nuclei in the compound. 
Some care is needed in using the values obtained from integration measure- 
ments, since frequently the steps are not well denned and it is not possible to 
measure their heights accurately. The values for the ratio of nuclei obtained may 
then be difficult to relate to whole numbers of nuclei and several possibilities 
must therefore be considered. It cannot be emphasised too strongly that all the 
likely ratios must be considered since an unjustified adherence to one set of 
values may lead to completely incorrect deductions being made subsequently. If 
the measurements do not lead to a realistic value for the proton ratio, the step 
heights in the integration curve should be carefully reconsidered. 

The heights of the steps in the integration curve in the toluene spectrum are in 
the ratio of 3:5 for peaks at ^ 2.13 and &lt;5 6.98 respectively. It is thus possible to 
assign the former to the methyl protons and the latter to the protons on the ben- 
zene ring. 

In contrast to 1 H spectra, it is not possible to determine the relative ratio of 
carbon atoms in a compound by integration of the peak areas in the 1 3 C FT- 
n.m.r. spectrum. There are two reasons for this. The first results from the differ- 
ent relaxation times of carbon atoms in different environments. This means that 
some atoms with long relaxation times may still be partly saturated when the 
next pulse of radiation is received, and the resulting absorption peak areas will 
not be proportional to the number of different carbon atoms. Carbon atoms 
without hydrogen attached have longer relaxation times and are therefore likely 
to give rise to peaks of lower intensity in the spectrum. The second reason is due 
to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE). This is the enhancement of some sig- 
nals in the 1 3 C spectrum as a result of the spin-decoupling process (see below) 
which is used to produce the normal, noise-decoupled spectrum by removing the 
interaction between carbon and hydrogen nuclei. The NOE is not the same for 
all nuclei. The maximum effect is for carbon atoms with hydrogen attached. The 
consequence is that carbon atoms without hydrogen attached appear without 
any NOE enhancement. As a result of these two effects it is often possible to 
identify by inspection, as a result of their low intensity, those peaks in the 1 3 C 
spectrum which result from carbon atoms not attached to hydrogen, including 
those in aromatic rings which carry a substituent. 

A number of other features apparent in the toluene proton spectrum are 
worthy of note at this stage. Each absorption is accompanied by a number of 
small satellite peaks equally spaced on either side of the main absorptions. These 
may be spinning side-bands or 13 C satellites (p. 342). The spinning side-bands are 
caused by inhomogeneities in the magnetic field and in the sample tube. They 



323 



3.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



can normally be identified easily since they are of much weaker intensity than 
the main signal, and furthermore they appear in pairs, equally spaced on either 
side of the main absorption band. The identification of these satellite peaks as 
spinning side-bands can be confirmed by re-recording the spectrum using a 
faster or slower rate of spinning of the sample tube; the spinning side-bands will 
then move respectively further from or nearer to the main absorption. 

The n.m.r. spectrum of an organic compound recorded as a solution (usually 
5-10%) sometimes exhibits small peaks arising from the solvent. The solvents 
normally chosen do not contain hydrogen; those commonly used include CC1 4 , 
CDC1 3&gt; (CD 3 ) 2 SO, (CD 3 ) 2 CO, C 6 D 6 , D 2 0, C 5 D 5 N. Usually, however, the 
deuterated solvents contain a small proportion of isotopically isomeric mole- 
cules containing hydrogen instead of deuterium, and this will give rise to an 
additional peak or peaks in the proton spectrum. A list of the position of these 
absorptions for some of the commoner solvents is given in Appendix 3, Table 
A3. 10. Care should be taken in comparing chemical shifts from spectra obtained 
using different solvents since variations may result, particularly when values 
obtained with aromatic solvents, such as benzene or pyridine, are compared 
with those obtained using saturated solvents. 

THE CHEMICAL SHIFT 

The position of an absorption peak relative to that of the reference compound is 
known as the chemical shift. Each nucleus in a different environment experiences 
a slightly different local magnetic field due to the circulation of electrons in 
neighbouring bonds and to through-space effects. A slightly different applied 
magnetic field is therefore required for resonance and absorption occurs in dif- 
ferent regions of the spectrum. Modification of the local magnetic environment 
at the nucleus, for example by the introduction of a substituent group, will alter 
the position of the absorption band. Effects which cause shifts to lower fields 
(downfield) are termed deshielding; the opposite effect (upfield shift) is termed 
shielding. Figure 3.44 shows approximate ranges of proton chemical shifts and 
Fig. 3.45 for 1 3 C chemical shifts. 

Measurement of the chemical shift. When a nucleus (or set of equivalent nuclei, 
see below) gives rise to a single absorption peak in the spectrum it is a simple 
matter to determine the chemical shift from a measurement of its separation 
from the reference peak. In 'H-spectra when coupling of the nucleus results in a 
first order multiplet (see below) measurement of the separation from the refer- 
ence peak must be made to the mid-point of the multiplet. In more complex 
spin-spin interactions it is not possible to determine directly the chemical shift 
by measurement in this way, and resort must be made to the application of 
mathematical methods of analysis. 

X H chemical shifts. More detailed chemical shift data for a wide range of proton 
environments is given in Appendix 3, Tables A3.1, A3.3 and A3.4. In particular 
the chemical shift values quoted in Table A3.1 show that an electronegative sub- 
stituent in aliphatic systems causes a downfield shift; the greater the electro- 
negativity the more substantial the shift. When two substituents are attached to 
the same carbon atom there is a greater downfield shift, but not as great as the 
sum of the two substituents separately. The approximate position of absorption 
in such cases can be predicted on the basis of the empirical parameters shown in 
Appendix 3, Table A3.2.

A comparison of the proton spectrum of anisole (Fig. 3.46) with that of 
toluene (Fig. 3.42) provides an illustration of the way in which substituents may 
influence the values of the chemical shift. The spectrum of toluene reveals the 
typical chemical shifts of aromatic protons and of methyl protons attached to an 
aromatic system. The five aromatic protons appear as a sharp single band; this is 
typical of those cases where the substituent is neither strongly shielding or de- 
shielding (e.g. alkyl or substituted alkyl groups). The spectrum of anisole 
(C 6 H 5 -OCH 3 ) shows the deshielding effect of the electronegative oxygen caus- 
ing the methyl absorption to be shifted downfield by a further 1.3 3 as compared 
to toluene. In contrast the absorptions due to the aromatic protons are shifted 
upfield and split into two groups, the intensities being in the ratio 2:3. The 
group shifted furthest upfield is due to the ortho and para protons, and the group 
only slightly shifted is due to the two meta protons. Substituents which have this 
shielding effect are those which are ortho/para directing in electrophilic substitu- 
tion reactions, e.g. hydroxy, alkoxy, amino and substituted amino groups (see 
Appendix 3, Table A3.5). 

The proton spectrum of phenylacetic acid (C 6 H 5 -CH 2 - C0 2 H; Fig. 3.47) ex- 
hibits three absorptions in the ratio 1:2:5 due to the carboxylic acid, methylene 
and phenyl protons respectively. The carboxylic acid proton has been offset by

400 Hz so that it can be recorded on the chart which specifies a sweep width of 
500 Hz. The actual absorption position of this proton, 3 11.67, is calculated by 
adding the amount by which the absorption has been offset (400 Hz) to the posi- 
tion of absorption recorded on the chart (300 Hz), i.e. 700 Hz, and dividing by 
the operating frequency (60 MHz). 

In the proton spectrum of acetophenone (C 6 H 5 -COCH 3 ; Fig. 3.48) the 
methyl absorption occurs at 5 2.40, which should be compared with the corres- 
ponding absorption in toluene, since this illustrates the greater deshielding effect 
of the carbonyl group relative to that of the aromatic ring. The protons on the 
aromatic ring in this case are shifted downfield as compared with those in 
toluene, and appear in two groups centred at 5 7.8 and 6 7.3, the intensities being 
in the ratio 2:3. The low-field group is due to the two protons ortho to the car- 
bonyl and the high-field group is due to the meta and para protons. Substituents 
which exhibit this strongly deshielding effect are those which are meta directing 
on electrophilic substitution reactions, e.g. acyl, carboxyl, alkoxycarbonyl, nitro, 
etc. (see Appendix 3, Table A3.5). 

13 C chemical shifts. A considerable amount of data is available which correlates 
the position of absorptions in the 13 C n.m.r. spectrum with the structure of an 
organic molecule, and it is these empirical correlations which provide the main 
basis for the use of the technique in structure determination. Figure 3.45 shows 
the general relationships between structure and chemical shift. The values for 
the chemical shift are normally related to the tetramethylsilane carbon absorp- 
tion, with positive values increasing to lower field (corresponding to the 3 scale 
in p.rar. spectroscopy). The vast majority of absorptions fall in a range of 
200 p.p.m. between the carbonyl absorptions at low field and the methyl absorp- 
tions at high field. The position of absorption of some of the commonly used sol- 
vents is also included in Fig. 3.45. 

Hybridisation of the carbon atom has a significant effect on the chemical 
shift: sp 3 -hybridised carbon absorbs at high field (0-60 p.p.m. downfield from 
TMS), sp 2 -carbon at low field (80-200 p.p.m.) and sp-carbon at intermediate 
values. The precise position of absorption of a particular atom is largely deter- 
mined by the electronic effects of any substituents, and the fact that these are 
approximately additive enables fairly accurate predictions of chemical shifts to 
be made, provided that similar compounds of known structure are available for 
reference purposes. 

Saturated compounds. The position of absorptions of methyl, methylene, meth- 
ine and quaternary carbon atoms in the alkanes is shown in Fig. 3.49. Within 
each group the exact position of absorption is determined by the number and 
nature of substituents on the /? and y carbons. Replacement of a proton by CH 3 
results in a downfield shift of c. 8 p.p.m. at C-l, and c. 10 p.p.m. at C-2, and an 
upfield shift at C-3 of c. 2 p.p.m. Polar substituents result in a downfield shift in 
the position of absorption; Table A3. 12 in Appendix 3 shows the effect on 13 C 
chemical shifts of replacing a methyl group by various polar substituents. 

Alkenes and aromatics. The resonances for these classes of compounds appear 
in the same region (80-140 p.p.m. downfield from TMS) since in both cases the 
carbon atoms are sp 2 -hybridised. Empirical rules for calculating the position of 
absorption in acyclic alkenes have been developed; the appropriate substituent 
parameter is added to the value for carbon in ethylene (123.3 p.p.m.).

Substituents attached to the olefinic carbon atoms exert a substantial effect 
on the chemical shift of both of these carbon atoms. These effects are exemplified 
by the chemical shift values for monosubstituted alkenes shown in Appendix 3, 
Table A3. 13. 

1 3 C chemical shifts in aromatic compounds are dependent on the polarity of 
the substituent. Appendix 3, Table A3. 14 shows the substituent effects for a 
range of substituted benzenes. The 13 C spectra of substituted benzenes can often 
be interpreted on the basis of these substituent parameters in association with 
data from off-resonance decoupled spectra. 



331 



3.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Some data for chemical shifts in heteroaromatic compounds are shown in 
Appendix 3, Table A3. 15. 

Organic functional groups. The general chemical shift range for carbonyl and 
other functional groups is shown in Fig. 3.45. Although there is considerable 
overlap, distinct regions of absorption can be identified. It is interesting to note 
that there is not a linear relationship between 13 C chemical shift and the car- 
bonyl stretching frequency in the infrared. The 13 C absorptions are shifted 
upfield by up to lOp.p.m. by the introduction of an a-halogen or a,/?- 
unsaturation. 

The following examples of 1 3 C spectra illustrate some of the general features 
discussed above. 

The 13 C spectrum of ethanol (CH 3 CH 2 OH; Fig. 3.50) illustrates the effect of 
an electronegative substituent on the chemical shift of saturated carbon atoms. 
The effect of the substituent is felt beyond the atom to which the substituent is 
directly bonded. This can be seen by comparing the chemical shift of the methyl 
carbon in ethanol (3 17.0) with that of the methyl carbon in hex-1-ene (3 14.0), 
Fig. 3.51. The methylene carbon in ethanol appears at 3 56.5, a downfield shift of 
about 35p.p.m. compared to the penultimate methylene carbon in hex-1-ene. 

The 13 C spectrum of hex-1-ene (CH 2 =CH-CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 3 ; Fig. 3.51) 
shows six distinct absorptions associated with each of the six carbon atoms. The

four sp 3 -hybridised carbons appear between 6 14.0 and 6 33.8 and the two sp 2 - 
hybridised carbons appear downfield at &lt;5 114.3 for the terminal carbon and 
8 139.2 for the substituted alkenyl carbon. 

The 13 C spectrum of crotonaldehyde (CH 3 CH=CHCHO; Fig. 3.52) pro- 
vides a good example of the way in which the ' 3 C chemical shift is determined 
both by the state of hybridisation of the carbon atom and the nature of the sub- 
stituent. The four carbon atoms have markedly different chemical shifts. The 
methyl carbon appears at 6 17.1. It is shifted downfield slightly compared to the 
methyl carbon at the end of a chain of methylene groups as in 3-methylheptane 
(Fig. 3.41) and hex-1-ene (Fig. 3.51). The two alkenyl carbons appear at 6 133.4 
and 3 152.9. The effect of conjugation of the carbon-carbon double bond is that 
the /?-carbon is shifted further downfield. The carbon of the carbonyl group is 
sp 2 -hybridised and is directly bonded to an electronegative atom. It is shifted 
furthest downfield and appears at 6 192.2. 

The 13 C spectrum of toluene (C 6 H 5 -CH 3 ; Fig. 3.43) shows five absorptions 
resulting from the five distinct locations of carbon in the molecule. The methyl 
carbon appears at £21.1, shifted downfield slightly compared to a methyl car- 
bon bonded to a saturated carbon. The six carbons of the aromatic ring result in 
four absorptions between 3 125.2 and 6 137.5, arising from the carbon directly 
bonded to the methyl group, and those in the ortho, meta and para positions.

SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.2 



Note the weak absorption of the aromatic carbon atom which carries the sub- 
stituent and therefore has no hydrogen atoms attached. 

The aromatic carbons in the 13 C spectrum of benzyl alcohol (C 6 H 5 -CH 2 OH; 
Fig. 3.53) result in a similar absorption pattern to that of toluene. The aliphatic 
carbon appears at 3 64.3, a downfield shift of more than 40 p.p.m. as a result of 
the replacement of one of the hydrogens of the methyl group by a hydroxyl 
group. The six carbons of the aromatic ring give a group of four absorptions 
between 3 126.9 and 3 140.9. 

The 13 C spectrum of anisole (C 6 H 5 -OCH 3 ; Fig. 3.54) further illustrates the 
deshielding effect which results from an electronegative atom such as oxygen. 
The methyl carbon of anisole appears at 3 54.8 a downfield shift of more than 
30 p.p.m. compared with the methyl carbon in toluene. The aromatic carbons 
have all been shifted downfield; the carbon directly bonded to the oxygen is 
most affected appearing at 3 159.9, a downfield shift of about 22 p.p.m. com- 
pared with the equivalent carbon in toluene. The ortho, meta and para carbon 
atoms appear at 3 114.1, 129.5 and 120.7 respectively. 

The aromatic carbon atoms in phenylacetic acid (C 6 H 5 -CH 2 -C0 2 H; Fig. 
3.55) result in a similar absorption pattern to that described above for benzyl 
alcohol. The methylene carbon appears at &lt;541.1 compared with 3 64.2 in benzyl 
alcohol. It is instructive to compare the chemical shift of the carbonyl carbon in 
phenylacetic acid (3 178.3), crotonaldehyde (3 192.2) (Fig. 3.52) and 4-methyl-

SPIN-SPIN SPLITTING 

The 13 C spectra discussed above consist of sets of single peaks each one due to 
a carbon atom in a particular magnetic environment. The majority of proton

SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.2 



spectra normally encountered by the organic chemist are much less simple in 
appearance. Proton absorptions frequently appear, not as sharp single peaks as 
in the case of the 13 C spectra, but as multiplets of varying complexity. The multi- 
ples result from interaction, or coupling between neighbouring nuclei. These 
multiplets can provide valuable information about the structure of the molecule. 
It should be noted that carbon atoms also couple with neighbouring nuclei but 
the results of these couplings are not observed in the 1 3 C spectra normally used 
by the organic chemist. The coupling between carbon and hydrogen has been 
removed by the process of noise decoupling in order to simplify the spectrum. 
The coupling between two 13 C nuclei is not significant because of the low 
natural abundance of the 13 C isotope. The phenomenon of spin-spin splitting is 
therefore discussed in terms of proton spectra. 

Equivalent protons. All hydrogens which are in identical environments have the 
same chemical shift and therefore absorb at the same frequency; they are said to 
be chemically equivalent. This can arise in two ways. Firstly, the protons are 
equivalent if they are bonded to the same carbon atom which is also free to 
rotate. For example, the three protons in a methyl group are equivalent and 
appear as a singlet (see the spectra of toluene, anisole or acetophenone above), 
and the two protons of a methylene group, provided that it can rotate freely, are 
identical and appear as a singlet (see the spectrum of phenylacetic acid above); 
frequently this is not the case with methylene groups in cyclic systems where 
rotation is restricted. 

Secondly, hydrogens on different carbon atoms will have the same chemical 
shift if they are structurally indistinguishable. Thus the spectrum of p-xylene 
exhibits two signals of relative intensity 3 : 2. There are six methyl protons in 
identical environments which appear at 3 2.3 and the four aromatic protons are 
identical and appear at 5 7.0. 




Methylene protons adjacent to a chiral centre will be non-equivalent, despite 
the fact that there is free rotation about the carbon-carbon bond. Such protons 
are described as diastereotopic, since replacement of either of the two hydrogens 
in turn by a group X produces a pair of diastereoisomers. Such is the case of the 
two methylene protons (H a and H b ) in 1 -phenyl propan-2-ol, which are non- 
equivalent and therefore have different chemical shifts in the p.m.r. spectrum.

Nuclei may be chemically equivalent but magnetically non-equivalent. To be 
magnetically equivalent nuclei must couple in exactly the same way to all other 
nuclei in the system. Thus the two protons in 1,1-difluoroethylene are magnetic- 

339 



3.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ally non-equivalent since the coupling of F a (and also of F b ) to each of H a and H b 
is different. 

&lt; "H b 

First-order spin-spin interactions. Protons bonded to adjacent carbon atoms or 
to carbon atoms connected by a conjugated system interact with each other so 
that the resulting signal appears as a multiplet rather than a singlet. If the differ- 
ence between the chemical shift values of the coupled protons is reasonably large 
in comparison with the value of the coupling constant, a first-order spin-spin 
coupling pattern results. For two groups of interacting nuclei the coupling con- 
stant J is given by the separation between any two adjacent peaks in a first-order 
multiplet; the value, which is quoted in Hz, is independent of the operating fre- 
quency of the instrument. The magnitude of the coupling constant is dependent 
on the relative positions of the two coupled nuclei in the molecule and frequently 
gives valuable information about the structure of the compound. 

It should be noted that if the two groups of protons are coupled to cause 
spin-spin splitting, the J value can be measured from the multiplet arising from 
either of the sets of protons. Thus in the spectrum of ethanol, the sample of 
which contains a trace of acid (Fig. 3.68) the coupling between the methyl and 
methylene protons can be determined by measurement of the separation 
between any two adjacent lines in the triplet resulting from the methyl group, or 
any two adjacent lines in the quartet resulting from the methylene group. 
Measurement of all coupling constants can frequently show which groups of 
protons are coupled with each other, and hence give valuable structural in- 
formation. A simple example of this procedure is seen in the spectrum of pure 
ethanol (Fig. 3.67) in which the methylene protons couple with both the methyl 
protons and with the hydroxyl protons, but with different coupling constants, 
7 Hz and 5 Hz respectively. Typical values of coupling constants are given in the 
correlation tables, Appendix 3, Tables A3.7, A3.8 and A3.9. 

The first-order multiplets arising from spin-spin coupling can be analysed on 
the basis of two simple rules which give information on the number of peaks in 
the multiplet and on the relative intensity of the peaks in the multiplet. 

1. The number of peaks. If a proton is coupled with N other equivalent protons 
the number of peaks in the multiplet is N + 1. 

2. Relative intensities in each multiplet. These can be deduced using Pascal's 
Triangle shown below. The value assigned to each position in the triangle is 
derived by adding together the values of adjacent positions in the preceding 
level; the outside position at each level is always unity. 




340 



SPECTROSCOPIC METHODS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECTRA 3.2 



Spin-spin splitting patterns arising from typical groups of protons are shown 
in Fig. 3.57. 

When a proton is coupled to two non-equivalent sets of neighbouring protons 
more complex multiplets result; this is illustrated by the spectrum of pure 
ethanol (Fig. 3.67). Thus the methylene protons are coupled to the three methyl 
protons, giving rise to a quartet, and are further coupled to the hydroxyl proton 
which therefore causes each of the peaks of the quartet to appear as a doublet. 
The multiplet therefore consists of eight peaks due to the two overlapping quar- 
tets i.e. (N + 1)(M + 1). On occasions there may be difficulty in recognising the 
components of these more complex multiplets, as some peaks may be superim- 
posed.

3.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




Long-range coupling, i.e. coupling beyond three bonds, may be observed in 

some circumstances, especially in conjugated systems. The coupling constants 

are then usually small (0-3 Hz) in comparison with geminal or vicinal coupling 

constants (cf. Appendix 3, Tables A3. 7 and A3. 8). Commonly encountered 

systems which exhibit long-range coupling are the allylic system 

I I 

(H — C=C — CH) and the corresponding acetylenic system (H — C=C — CH), 

and aromatic and heteroaromatic rings. Conjugated acetylenes are capable of 
spin-spin interaction over as many as nine bonds. Long-range coupling is often 
observed between nuclei which are linked by a conjugated system arranged in a 
zig-zag manner thus: 



The conjugated system is often part of a cyclic or polycyclic compound, e.g. 

„^» 

L II 
O 

Coupling between protons and other nuclei is often useful in interpreting 
spectra of appropriate compounds. Weak satellites, arising from 13 C — 1 H 
coupling, may sometimes be observed near strong signals in the proton spec- 
trum. They can be recognised since they appear as doublets 50 to 100 Hz on 
either side of the main signal and are unaffected by the rate of spinning of the 
sample (unlike spinning side-bands). 13 C satellites are visible in the spectrum of 
toluene (Fig. 3.42). 

Values for coupling constants between protons and other atoms are given in 
Appendix 3, Table A3.8. 

Distortion of multiplets. The two rules for analysing spin-spin splitting patterns 
can only be applied exactly when the difference between the chemical shifts of 
the coupling nuclei is substantially greater (about 10 times) than the value of the 
coupling constants. As the chemical shift difference decreases the simple first- 
order analysis starts to break down. For groups of protons which are still well 
separated this results in a distortion of the multiplets. This distortion results in 
the inner peaks (i.e. those nearer the other multiplet) of the two multiplets 
increasing in intensity while the outer peaks decrease in intensity. This is often a 
useful guide for establishing which groups of multiplets are related by spin-spin 
coupling. This distortion is diagrammatically illustrated in the calculated spec- 
tra shown in Fig. 3.58 where Av/J is 14 and 5.7. 

More complex spin-spin interactions. As the chemical shift difference becomes 
similar to the value of the coupling constant, the first-order analysis breaks 
down completely. It is then not possible to measure either the chemical shift or 
the coupling constants directly from the spectrum and resort must be made to 
more rigorous analytical procedures which are beyond the scope of this book. 
However, there are available a variety of computer programs specifically 
designed to analyse complex n.m.r. spectra. 311

Frequently, however, it is necessary only to recognise complex patterns aris- 
ing from common groupings and not to analyse them completely. The nomen- 
clature which is adopted for naming spin-spin systems follows from the number 
of interacting nuclei and the magnitude of the chemical shift differences as com- 
pared to the coupling constants. Thus nuclei are represented by letters of the 
alphabet (A, B, M, X, Y, etc.), the first letters of the alphabet being used for 
nuclei at lowest field. Nuclei which are chemically identical but magnetically 
non-equivalent are differentiated by primes (A,A', B,B', etc.). Nuclei which have 
a large chemical shift difference as compared with the coupling constants are 
represented by letters well separated in the alphabet giving rise to systems such 
as AX, AMX, etc. If the chemical shift differences are of the same order of magni- 
tude as the coupling constant, letters adjacent in the alphabet are used, so that 
AX becomes AB, the AMX system becomes ABC, etc. Some examples are given 
in Appendix 3, Table A3. 11. A useful compilation for the recognition of spin 
systems has been published, 31 but the following systems are those commonly 
encountered and they are illustrated with appropriate spectra. 

Two-spin system (AB). In all cases (except when Av/J = and hence the spec- 
trum is a single absorption line, A 2 ) the splitting pattern shows two doublets (a 
doublet of doublets) distorted to a greater or lesser extent; this is often referred 
to misleadingly as the 'AB quartet'. The coupling constant J AB is the separation 
between the lines of either doublet. The change in the splitting pattern as the 
chemical shift difference (Av) approaches the value of the coupling constant J is 
shown in Fig. 3.58.

triplet as described above. The change in the appearance of the spectrum as Av 
approaches J is shown in Fig. 3.59. Note that the number of peaks in the spec- 
trum increases. The spectrum of pyrogallol (Fig. 3.60) illustrates a typical AB 2 
spectrum; the inset is the scale-expanded spectrum of the aromatic region. 

(b) AMX, ABX, ABC. The spectrum of pyrrole- 2-carboxylic acid (Fig. 3.61) 
illustrates a first-order AMX system. The spectrum contains three multiplets in 
the region 8 6-7 due to the C — H protons of the heteroaromatic ring. The 
expanded spectrum (50 Hz sweep width) shows that each of these multiplets 
consists of a doublet of doublets. Two coupling constants can be extracted from 
each multiplet by measurement of the separation between the first and second 
peaks, and between the first and third peaks of each multiplet; this is shown in 
the inset. The vinyl group often gives rise to an ABX spectrum as shown in the 
spectrum of styrene (Fig. 3.62). If accurate values for the coupling constants and 
chemical shifts are required from such a spectrum, resort must be made to more 
rigorous methods of analysis. However, a qualitative approach is frequently all 
that is required and on this basis the spectrum can be analysed easily. Trie X 
proton couples with protons A and B to give a distorted doublet of doublets, 
which form the four lines in the X portion of the spectrum. Protons A and B each 
give rise to doublets due to coupling with the X proton, and each of these four 
peaks is further split by the small coupling between the A and B protons. The 
ABC spectrum is very complex and does not readily yield useful information. 

Aromatic compounds. The magnitude of the coupling constants due to coupling 
between protons attached to the aromatic ring varies in the order o &gt; m&gt; p; 
para coupling constants are in fact frequently not discernible in the spectrum.

Zanger (1972). 'The Determination of Aromatic Substitution Patterns by Nuclear Mag- 
netic Resonance', Organic Magnetic Resonance, 4, 4. Published by Heyden and Son Ltd. 

Seven possible first-order splitting patterns for aromatic protons coupling with 
one, two or three protons in the ortho or meta positions are shown in Fig. 3.63. 
Although the patterns in practice may be distorted to a greater or less extent, the 
spectra of many substituted aromatic systems may be analysed on this basis. 
For example, the splitting in the spectrum of w-dinitrobenzene (Fig. 3.64) can be 
recognised as di-meta (H a ), ortho/di-meta (H b and H b ') and di-ortho (H c ); some 
small additional splitting due to para coupling is apparent in the spectrum. 

PROTONS ATTACHED TO HETEROATOMS — EXCHANGEABLE 
PROTONS 

The heteroatoms most commonly encountered by the organic chemist are oxy- 
gen, nitrogen and sulphur. The position of absorption of protons attached to 
these atoms is not normally sufficiently reliable for interpretative purposes, 
although there are exceptions to this general rule (e.g. carboxylic acids, enols,

etc., see Appendix 3, Table A3.6). The position of the absorption is often highly 
dependent on the nature of the solvent and the concentration. However, there is 
one property of this group of protons which is of great value in interpretation; it 
is often possible, under appropriate circumstances, to replace the proton by deu- 
terium which does not exhibit nuclear magnetic resonance under the conditions 
used for p.m.r., and hence the absorption is completely removed. The procedure 
is illustrated with reference to the spectra of benzyl alcohol (C 6 H 5 -CH 2 OH; Figs 
3.65 and 3.66). 

The spectrum of a solution in deuterochloroform (Fig. 3.65) shows three 
absorptions at &lt;54.5, 5.08 and 7.3 with an intensity ratio of 2:1 :5. The effect of 
adding a few drops of deuterium oxide to the sample tube and shaking vigor- 
ously is shown in the re-recorded spectrum (Fig. 3.66). The absorption at 3 5.08 
in the original spectrum which disappears on deuteration is clearly due to the 
hydroxyl proton. 

Protons attached to heteroatoms may not always exhibit coupling with 
neighbouring protons if rapid proton exchange between molecules is catalysed 
by the presence of trace impurities. A comparison of the spectra of pure ethanol 
and ethanol containing a trace of acid illustrates this effect (Figs 3.67 and 3.68). 
In the second spectrum the rapid exchange of the protons of the hydroxyl group 
occurs at a rate much faster than the p.m.r. resonance process. All the hydroxyl 
proton environments are therefore averaged and a singlet is observed for this 
proton; the methylene group is now only coupled to methyl protons and appears 
as a quartet. 

Chemical shift data for protons attached to heteroatoms is listed in Appendix 
3, Table A3.6. Protons attached directly to nitrogen may appear in the spectrum 
as very broad absorptions due to quadrupole interaction with nitrogen, and as a 
result the absorptions may be difficult to discern. 

SIMPLIFICATION OF X H SPECTRA 

The chemist can adopt a variety of procedures to simplify complex spectra to 
make them more amenable to first-order analysis or analysis by inspection. A 
simple example is deuterium exchange which was described in the previous sec- 
tion. Acidic protons attached to carbon may also be exchanged under basic con- 
ditions. 

Considerable simplification of a complex spectrum may be achieved by run- 
ning the spectrum at higher magnetic fields (up to 300 MHz), which causes 
linear expansion of the spectrum but leaves the relative chemical shifts un- 
changed. The instrumentation required, however, is expensive and may not be 
available. 

An alternative method of modifying the magnetic field experienced by the 
protons (with the consequent simplification of the spectra) is to add a para- 
magnetic compound (a shift reagent) to the solution. 3jk The shift reagent co- 
ordinates with electronegative atoms in the substrate and thus modifies the 
magnetic field experienced by neighbouring protons. Since the strength of this 
field varies with the distance from the paramagnetic source, the chemical shift of 
each proton is modified by a different amount. The effect is to spread out the 
absorptions which previously overlapped and this frequently allows a first-order 
analysis of the spectrum.

The most commonly used shift reagents are tris-chelates of lanthanide ions 
with the /?-diketones, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylheptane-3,5-dione (dipivaloylmethane, 
(1)) and l,l,l,2,2,3,3-heptafluoro-7,7-dimethyloctane-4,6-dione (2). Typical 
reagents are tris-(dipivaloylmethanato) europium and tris- 1,1,1 ,2,2,3,3- 
heptafluoro-7,7-dimethyloctane-4,6-dionato europium, the names of which are 
normally abbreviated to Eu(dpm) 3 and Eu(fod) 3 .

A wide range of lanthanide shift reagents is now commercially available includ- 
ing some derived from diketones in which all the protons have been replaced by 
deuterium, thus preventing any interference in the p.m.r. spectrum. 

The extent of the lanthanide-induced shift is dependent on the basicity of the 
functional group and on the nature, purity and concentration of the shift 
reagent. Alcohols and amines generally exhibit the largest shift, but many other 
compounds such as ethers, carbonyl compounds, nitriles, sulphoxides, oximes, 
etc., exhibit useful shifts. Of the commonly used reagents Eu(fod) 3 normally 
causes the greatest shifts as it is a stronger Lewis acid. It also has the advantage 
of a much higher solubility. The magnitude of the lanthanide-induced shift is 
considerably decreased by the presence of a small amount of water, and since 
many of the reagents are hygroscopic, care should be taken in their handling and 
storage. 

The two major applications of lanthanide shift reagents are firstly the simpli- 
fication of the spectrum, and secondly the confirmation of the assignment of sig- 
nals by relating the extent of the shift to the concentration of the shift reagent. 

The effect on the spectrum of 4-methylpentan-2-one caused by the addition of 
increasing amounts of a shift reagent is shown in Fig. 3.69. The shift reagent used 
in this case is the europium chelate of l,l,l,2,2-pentafluoro-6,6-dimethyl-3,5- 
heptanedione [Eupfd, CF 3 CF 2 COCH 2 COC(CH 3 ) 3 ]. In the absence of a 
shift reagent the absorption of three of the groups of protons virtually overlaps; 
addition of the shift reagent spreads out these absorptions to allow a ready ana- 
lysis of the spectrum as indicated. Those protons closest to the donor atom (in 
this case the carbonyl oxygen) are shifted by a larger extent for a given amount 
of reagent added. This relationship is illustrated in Fig. 3.70, which shows that 
the methyl and methylene groups bonded to the carbonyl are shifted the most, 
followed by the methine proton, and the methyl groups furthest from the carbo- 
nyl are shifted least. 

The assignment of absorptions in the n.m.r. spectrum is greatly assisted by 
the use of shift reagents. Figure 3.71 shows the proton shifts of the tricyclic dilac- 
tam (3) as a function of the concentration of Eu(fod) 3 . Linear plots with varying 
slopes are obtained, the largest slope resulting from the four protons at C-5 and 
C-ll which are closest to the lanthanide ion. The protons at C-2 and C-8 which 
were initially at lower field are shifted least and hence the lines intersect.

Spin decoupling. 31 ' mn Spin decoupling is a technique for determining which 
nuclei are coupled together by observing the effect in the spectrum when the 
coupling is removed. The decoupling is achieved by irradiating the substrate 
with a strong radiofrequency signal corresponding to the resonance frequency of 
one of the nuclei; the spectrum resulting from the remaining nuclei is scanned to 
observe any simplification which results. Successful decoupling is not achieved if 
the separation of the coupled multiplets is less than about 20 Hz for a 100-MHz 
instrument.

Figure 3.73(a) shows the spin-spin splitting in the olefinic region. The multiplet 
at low field is two slightly overlapping quartets which arise from the coupling of 
the proton H a with the methyl protons (H c ) to give a quartet which is then split 
into a pair of quartets by coupling with the proton H b . The multiplet at higher 
field is more complex and arises from the proton H b . Coupling of H b to H a gives 
a doublet, each signal of which is split into a pair of doublets by coupling with 
the aldehydic proton H d . Each of these signals is then split by the methyl pro- 
tons to give the observed four closely-spaced quartets. Irradiation at the methyl 
protons causes all the quartets to collapse to single peaks, and the re-run, simpli- 
fied spectrum, Fig. 3.73(b), now shows the low-field doublet corresponding to H a 
and the pair of doublets for H b , where coupling to H a and H d only is observed. 



INTERPRETATION OF THE P.M.R. SPECTRUM 

It is not possible to prescribe a set of rules which is applicable on all occasions. 
The amount of additional information available will most probably determine 
the amount of information it is necessary to obtain from the p.m.r. spectrum. 
However, the following general procedure will form a useful initial approach to 
the interpretation of most spectra. 

1. Make a table of the chemical shifts of all the groups of absorptions in the spec- 
trum. In some cases it will not be possible to decide whether a particular 

359 



3.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



group of absorptions arises from separate sets of nuclei, or form a part of one 
complex multiplet. In such cases it is probably best initially to include them 
under one group and to note the spread of chemical shift values. 

2. Measure and record the heights of the integration steps corresponding to each 

group of absorptions. With overlapping groups of protons it may not be pos- 
sible to measure these exactly, in which case a range should be noted. Work 
out possible proton ratios for the range of heights measured, by dividing by 
the lowest height and multiplying as appropriate to give integral values. If the 
accurate measurement of integration steps is not possible a range of proton 
ratios should be calculated, and noted down. 

3. Note any obvious splitting of the absorptions in the table (e.g. doublet, triplet, 
quartet, etc.). For spectra which appear to show first-order splitting, the 
coupling constants of each multiplet should be determined by measuring the 
separation between adjacent peaks in the multiplet. Any other recognisable 
patterns which are not first order should be noted. 

4. Note any additional information such as the effect of shaking with D 2 0, use of 

shift reagents, etc. 

5. Attempt a preliminary assignment of the nature (e.g. alkyl, alkenyl, aryl) of 
each of the groups of absorptions on the basis of their chemical shift. 

6. By considering both the relative intensities and the multiplicities of the 
absorptions attempt to determine which groups of protons are coupled to- 
gether. The magnitude of the coupling constant may give an indication of the 
nature of the protons involved. 

7. Relate the information thus obtained to any other information available on 
the compound under consideration. 

8. Having arrived at a possible structure or partial structure consult the correla- 

tion tables and work out the position and nature of the absorptions expected 
from the postulated structure. 

9. Decide whether additional information, e.g. spin decoupling or the use of shift 
reagents, is required. 

10. Repeat steps 6, 7, 8 until a self-consistent set of results is obtained. 

FURTHER INFORMATION FROM 13 C SPECTRA 

Only one of the three items of information normally available from p.m.r. spec- 
tra (i.e. chemical shift, coupling constant and relative numbers of absorbing nuc- 
lei) is routinely available from the 1 3 C spectrum, and that is the chemical shift. 
Quantitative coupling constants are not normally obtained, and relative 
numbers of nuclei cannot usually be derived from measurement of peak areas. 
The large 13 C — 1 U coupling constant (125-200 Hz for directly bonded protons) 
results in multiplets which overlap to a considerable extent, and in the absence 
of decoupling makes the spectrum difficult to analyse. Spectra are therefore 
normally spin-decoupled and each absorption appears as a sharp singlet; this 
technique is known as wide-band or noise decoupling. Although the sensitivity 
is thus increased, all the information normally available from spin-spin splitting 
patterns is lost. An alternative method of decoupling (off- resonance decoupling) 
does however allow coupling of directly bonded carbon and hydrogen to be 
observed, although the separation of the peaks of the multiplets produced by 
this method is not equal to the true 13 C — 1 H coupling constant. It is thus pos- 
sible to identify carbon atoms associated with methyl, methylene and methine 
groups since the absorptions appear as quartets, triplets and doublets respect- 

360 



MASS SPECTROMETRY 3.3 



ively, provided that the bonded hydrogens are equivalent. The use of the off- 
resonance procedure is illustrated in Figs 3.74(a) and 3.74(b), which shows the 
noise decoupled and off-resonance decoupled spectra of butane- 1,3-diol and 
2,2'-bipyridyl respectively. The methyl carbon of the diol appears as a quartet at 
high field; the two methylene carbons appear as triplets, the one bonded to oxy- 
gen being at lower field, and the low-field doublet is due to the methine carbon. 
In the case of 2,2'-bipyridyl each carbon bonded to one hydrogen appears as a 
doublet; the two carbons bonded to nitrogen appear at lower field. 



3.3 MASS SPECTROMETRY 

It is unlikely that the laboratory organic chemist will be required to record mass 
spectra of compounds produced in the laboratory as they will normally be 
obtained through a centralised service. This section therefore concentrates on 
the interpretation of spectra rather than on the techniques for obtaining the 
spectra. For further information on this aspect of mass spectrometry the reader 
should consult the sources listed in the references at the end of this chapter. 4 
Probably the most common use of mass spectrometry by the organic chemist 
is for the accurate determination of molecular weight. A second important use is 
to provide information about the structure of compounds by an examination of 
the fragmentation pattern.

THE MASS SPECTRUM 

In a typical mass spectrometer, an organic compound under high vacuum is 
bombarded with electrons (of about 70 eV energy). Loss of an electron from the 
molecule followed by various fission processes gives rise to ions and neutral 
fragments. The positive ions are expelled from the ionisation chamber and 
resolved by means of a magnetic or an electric field. 

The mass spectrum is a record of the current produced by these ions as they 
arrive at a detector. The intensity of a peak in the spectrum is thus an indication 
of the relative number of ions; the larger the peak the more abundant the ion 
producing it. Many mass spectrometers produce up to five traces simultan- 
eously of differing sensitivity to allow weaker peaks to be studied, while also 
allowing intense peaks to be recorded on the chart. Figure 3.75 shows part of a

low resolution spectrum and a number of features should be noted. The most 
intense peak in the spectrum is known as the base peak. Ions produced in the 
fragmentation of the organic compound are separated according to their mass : 
charge ratio (m/z) (formerly mje). Since the majority of ions are singly charged 
the scale is often thought of as a mass scale; however, doubly charged ions are not 
Uncommon and these appear at half their mass value on the m/z scale. Many 
compounds give rise to an ion which corresponds to the removal of a single elec- 
tron from the molecule; this is known as the molecular ion (M) and usually has 
the highest m/z value in the spectrum, with the exception of a characteristic 
group of peaks at m/z values of M + 1, M + 2, M + 3, . . ., etc. The latter are 
isotope peaks which arise from the fact that many of the elements normally 
present in organic molecules are not monoisotopic. Peaks in the mass spectrum 
are usually sharp and appear at integral mass values (with the exception of those 
arising from some doubly charged ions). Occasionally peaks are observed which 
are broad, spread over several mass units and of low intensity; these are called 
'metastable peaks' and give valuable information about the mode of fragmen- 
tation. 

Spectra produced by most spectrometers are not in a suitable form for repro- 
duction and cannot easily be compared with spectra from other instruments. 
Magnetic focusing instruments give spectra with non-linear m/z scales whereas 
those from quadrupole or time-of-flight instruments are linear. It is common 
practice to represent spectra in the form of a bar graph (Fig. 3.76) with a linear 
m/z scale. The base peak is given the arbritrary value of 100 per cent and the 
height of each other peak is measured relative to that value. An alternative 
method of representation is to tabulate the intensity of the current arising from 
each ion relative to the total ion current. The output from many mass spectro- 
meters can now be handled by computers which allow considerable flexibility in 
the form of presentation of the spectra. Bar graphs can be produced directly and 
a large reference collection has been produced in this way. 6h 

Instruments vary considerably in the extent to which they can separate ions 
of closely related m/z values. In the vast majority of routine uses the organic 
chemist requires only the separation of ions having nominal unit masses of up to 
molecular weights of about 500-600, which can be achieved using an instrument 
of low resolution. Occasionally, however, it is of value to determine the precise

mass of particular ions accurately (up to six places of decimals) and for this pur- 
pose an instrument of high resolution is required. 

Molecular formulae. Probably the most useful single piece of information for 
the organic chemist which can be derived from the mass spectrum is the molecu- 
lar formula. Provided that the molecular ion can be identified, there are in prin- 
ciple two methods for deriving the molecular formula, using either high or low 
resolution. The most reliable method, although requiring the more sophisticated 
high-resolution instrumentation, is the accurate mass measurement of the 
molecular ion. Since atomic masses are not exact integers (see Appendix 4, Table 
A4.1) each combination of atoms will have a unique non-integral value. For 
example, CH 2 and C 2 H 6 both have an integral mass of 30 but the accurate 
masses are 30.010565 and 30.046950 respectively. Accurate mass measurement 
will therefore distinguish between these two molecules. Tables are available 
which reduce the problem of relating accurate masses to possible molecular for- 
mulae. 6 ' Accurate mass determination is most useful to the organic chemist in 
confirming the identity of a specific molecular ion rather than in suggesting pos- 
sible formulae for completely unknown molecules. 

An alternative method of determination of the molecular formula which util- 
ises low-resolution spectra is based on the measurement of the intensities of the 
isotope peaks. The natural abundance of the stable isotopes of some common 
elements is shown in Appendix 4, Table A4.2. The data are presented in two 
ways, firstly as a percentage of the total isotopes present, and secondly as a per- 
centage of the most abundant isotope. Each combination of atoms will thus give 
rise to a group of isotope peaks of predictable intensities. Taking methane as an 
example, the ratio 12 CH 4 : 13 CH 4 = 100:1.08. Thus the intensity of the M -I- 1 
peak will be 1.08 per cent of the intensity of the molecular peak, although there 
will also be a very small contribution from ^C'Hs 2 ?!. Table 3.2 lists some of the 
intensities of the M + 1 and M + 2 peaks for various combinations of C, H, N, 
O having a nominal mass of 120.

Extensive compilations of such data are available: they can easily be modified to 
include elements other than C, H, O and N. 

One limitation on the use of isotope peak intensities to determine the molecu- 
lar formula is that the molecular ion must be relatively intense, otherwise the 
isotope peaks will be too weak to be measured with the necessary accuracy. Dif- 
ficulty may also arise from spurious contributions to the isotope peak intensities 
from the protonated molecular ion, from weak background peaks or from 
impurities in the sample. In any event the method is only reliable for molecules 
having molecular weights up to about 250-300.

3.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Deductions from isotope abundances. Assuming that the molecular ion has been 
identified correctly and intensities of the isotope peaks measured, the next stage 
in the analysis is to work out all possible molecular formulae which are consist- 
ent with this information. The common elements can be divided into three 
groups according to their isotopic composition. Firstly, those elements with a 
single natural isotope, e.g. hydrogen, fluorine, phosphorus, iodine. Hydrogen is 
placed in this group since the contribution from 2 H is extremely small. Secondly, 
those elements with a second isotope of one mass unit higher than the most 
abundant isotope, e.g. carbon and nitrogen. Thirdly, those with an isotope two 
mass units higher than the most abundant, e.g. chlorine, bromine, sulphur, sili- 
con and oxygen. 

Members of the last group, and especially chlorine and bromine, are most 
easily recognised from the characteristic patterns of the peaks, spaced at inter- 
vals of two mass units, which they produce in the spectrum. Typical patterns for 
combinations of bromine and chlorine atoms are shown in Figs 3.77 and 3.78. It 
may be difficult to estimate the number of oxygen atoms due to the low natural 
abundance (0.20%) of 18 0. 

The intensity of the M + 1 peak allows an estimate to be made of the number 
of carbon and nitrogen atoms (however, if CI, Br, S, or Si is present, loss of a 
proton from the M + 2 may enhance the intensity of the M + 1 peak). For a 
molecule not containing nitrogen, the maximum number of carbon atoms can 
be deduced by dividing the relative intensity of the M + 1 peak by 1.1 Thus a 
molecule having twelve C atoms will give an M + 1 peak of 13.2 per cent. If 
nitrogen is present its contribution to the M + 1 peak will amount to 0.36 x

number of nitrogen atoms; this figure must be subtracted from the measured 
relative intensity of the M + 1 peak before calculating the number of carbon 
atoms. An indication of the number of nitrogen atoms present may be deduced 
with the aid of the 'nitrogen rule' (see below). 

Once the numbers of these two groups of elements have been estimated, the 
remainder of the mass of the ion must be due to the monoisotopic elements, the 
numbers of which can then usually be deduced. 

A study of isotope abundance can give information about the elemental com- 
position of other ions in the spectrum as well as the molecular ion. However, 
care must be taken that the intensities being measured arise solely from the iso- 
topic contribution and not from other ions of different elemental composition. 

Recognition of the molecular ion. Since the molecular formula is normally the 
most important piece of information to be derived from the mass spectrum it is 
necessary to be as certain as possible that the molecular ion within the molecular 
cluster (M, M + 1, M + 2, etc.) has been correctly identified. A number of tests 
can be applied which will show if an ion is not the molecular ion. 

The ion must be an odd-electron ion since the molecular ion is produced by 
loss of one electron from the neutral molecule: the converse is not true since 
there may well be odd-electron ions other than the molecular ion in the spec- 
trum, arising from rearrangement reactions. If the elemental composition of the 
ion can be determined, the index of hydrogen deficiency (the sum of multiple 
bonds and ring systems) can be used to determine whether the ion is an odd- 
electron ion. The index of hydrogen deficiency is the number of pairs of hydrogen 
atoms which must be removed from the saturated open-chain formula to give 
the observed molecular formula. For a molecule IyllnNIJVj: 

the index of hydrogen deficiency = x — y/2 + z/2 + 1 

where I = any monovalent atom 

II = O, S or any other divalent atom 
HI = N, P or any other trivalent atom 
IV = C, Si or any other tetravalent atom 

For example, thiophene, C 4 H 4 S, ^o J? ' nas an index °f hydrogen deficiency 



367 



3.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



of (4 — \ + 1) = 3. The index of hydrogen deficiency must be a whole number 
for an odd-electron ion. For an even-electron ion the value will be non-integral. 

A second test which can be applied is the nitrogen rule. If a molecule (or ion) 
contains an odd number of nitrogen atoms it will have an odd numerical value 
for the molecular weight, whereas if it contains zero or an even number of nitro- 
gen atoms it will have an even-numbered molecular weight. The rule applies to 
all compounds containing C, H, O, N, S, halogens, P, B, Si. Thus for a species 
with zero or even number of nitrogens, odd-electron ions will have an even mass 
number and even-electron ions will have an odd mass number. 

A third indication that an ion is indeed the molecular ion may be obtained 
from an examination of the fragment ion peaks in the vicinity of the ion. Mass 
losses of between 3 and 15 and between 20 and 26 are highly unlikely, and if they 
are observed would suggest that the putative molecular ion is in fact a fragment 
ion. 

Alteration of instrumental conditions may also provide evidence to confirm 
the recognition of the molecular ion. The use of maximum sensitivity may show 
up a very weak molecular ion. Alternatively, if the energy of the electron beam is 
decreased the intensity of the fragment ions will decrease relative to the molecu- 
lar ion; this also applies to fragment ions arising from impurities. Alternative 
methods of ionisation such as chemical ionisation and field ionisation are very 
much more likely to produce a molecular ion cluster than the electron ionisation 
method, and should be used if they are available. 

Intensity of the molecular ion. The lower the energy required for ionisation of 
the molecule, and the more stable the molecular ion, the more intense will be the 
peak in the mass spectrum. Structural features within the molecule have charac- 
teristic values of ionisation energy and hence determine the amount of energy 
required to form the molecular ion. Table 3.3 gives a general indication of the 
intensity of the molecular ion for various types of compounds. It must be borne 
in mind that if the molecule contains a readily cleaved bond the molecular ion 
peak will be much less intense. In general the intensity of the molecular ion in- 
creases with unsaturation and with the number of rings, but decreases with 
chain branching. The presence of heteroatoms with easily ionised outer-shell 
electrons increases the intensity of the molecular ion.

Fragmentation. Although it may be of very low abundance, the molecular ion 
provides vital information about the identity of the molecule. Further informa- 
tion must be derived from the fragmentation pattern, i.e. the pattern of ions pro- 
duced by decomposition of the molecular ion. Not all ions are of equal 
importance and some guidelines and rationalisations are needed to enable the 
organic chemist to derive the information required from the mass spectrum. 
Firstly, as discussed above, the molecular ion is the most important in the spec- 
trum. Secondly, odd-electron ions are generally of more significance than even- 
electron ions of similar mass or abundance, since they are generally formed via a 
rearrangement reaction which may be characteristic of a particular class of com- 
pound. Thirdly, ions of high mass are likely to give more useful information than 
those at lower mass, since they are likely to have been formed as the result of a 
simple rational fragmentation. Fourthly, metastable ions (see later) may give 
useful information on the nature of the fragmentation processes. 

There are two important factors which determine the intensities of fragment 
ions in the mass spectrum: the stability of the ion, and the energy relationships of 
the bonds broken and formed in the reactions leading to the ion. Although the 
conditions in the mass spectrometer (very low pressure, unimolecular reactions) 
differ substantially from those normally encountered in organic chemistry, the 
fundamental ideas of physical organic chemistry, and in particular those con- 
cerned with carbocation stability, can be used effectively in the rationalisation of 
the appearance of the mass spectrum. Thus the following common fragmen- 
tations all give rise to typically stable carbocations.

The molecular ion is formed by removal from the molecule of the electron of

the order

A radical ion is thus formed which can fragment in a variety of ways. Simple 
bond cleavage may occur to give a neutral and an ionic fragment. Alternatively, 
a number of rearrangement processes may take place which are then followed by 
bond cleavage reactions. The important types of fragmentations and rearrange- 
ments are summarised and exemplified below. 

Fragmentation by movement of one electron. Bonds are broken by movement of 
one electron, represented by a fish-hook arrow (&gt;-*).

An electron pair is donated to the charge site. The electron pair may come 
from the bond adjacent to the charge site. 



Rearrangements. These may yield odd-electron ions which are normally easily 
identified in the spectrum (cf. the nitrogen rule above). They are thus useful aids 
in the interpretation of the spectrum. Owing to the large excess of energy norm- 
ally available in the ion source, molecular rearrangements are extremely 
common (see below). They may be random rearrangements (scrambling) which 
result in the general redistribution of certain atoms in the molecule, or more spe- 
cific rearrangements, frequently involving a transfer of a hydrogen atom, which 
are characteristic of a certain type of molecular structure and give rise to easily 
recognisable ions in the mass spectrometer. It is the latter type which are par- 
ticularly useful in the elucidation of molecular structure. 

The most frequently encountered example is the McLafferty rearrangement 
which involves the transfer of a y-hydrogen atom in an unsaturated system via a 
low-energy six-membered transition state:

The ionic fragment may be either the alkene or the fragment containing the 
heteroatom; this is determined by the relative ionisation potentials of the two 
groups. The rearrangement is general for this type of functional grouping and 
also occurs with oximes, hydrazones, ketimines, carbonates, phosphates, sul- 
phites, alkenes and phenylalkanes. A similar rearrangement may occur in satur- 
ated systems; in this case a small cyclic transition state is permitted since it does 
not have to accommodate the double bond.

3.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Peaks which arise from metastable ion decomposition are normally broad and 
of low intensity. They arise from the fragmentation of ions which have already 
been accelerated out of the ion source but have not yet reached the magnetic 
field. They are thus displaced from the position in the spectrum which would 
correspond to their true mass. The position of the metastable peak (w*) is 
related to the mass of the precursor ion (m^ and the mass of the product ion 
(m 2 ) by the equation. 

m* = v A ' 

The existence of a metastable ion and its relationship to m x and m 2 thus confirm 
that the ion m 2 was in fact formed directly from m x . There are in theory many 
possible solutions to the equation, but the actual solution is normally obtained 
by inspection of the spectrum using major peaks, usually of similar intensity, as 
possible values for m x and m 2 . For spectrometers which have an exponential 
mass scan this is a simple operation since the distances between m* and m 2 , and 
m 2 and m± will be identical. 

Although they may be of low abundance, ions at the high mass end of the 
spectrum are of major significance in providing information about molecular 
structure. They result from the loss of small neutral fragments and are least 
likely to be the result of random rearrangements. Thus M — 1,M — 15, M — 18 
peaks normally arise from loss of H, CH 3 and H 2 respectively. A list of some 
common neutral fragments is given in Appendix 4, Table A4.3. 

APPEARANCE OF THE MASS SPECTRUM 

The number of abundant ions in the mass spectrum and their distribution is 
indicative of the type of molecule. As discussed above, the mass and the relative 
abundance of the molecular ion gives an indication of the size and general stabil- 
ity of the molecule. An abundant molecular ion is expected, for example, from 
aromatic and saturated polycyclic molecules, provided that no easily cleaved 
group is present. A spectrum consisting of a few prominent ions suggests there 
are only a few favoured decomposition pathways indicating a small number of 
labile bonds or stable products. 

The presence of particular series of ions in the spectrum is often indicative of 
certain types of molecules. Compounds with large saturated hydrocarbon 
groups give series of ions separated by fourteen mass units, corresponding to 
CH 2 , since all the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds are of similar 
energy. The abundance of ions at the lower end of the spectrum steadily in- 
creases for straight-chain alkyl groups as the result of secondary reactions (see 
the spectrum of decane. Fig. 3.79(a)). The sequence in straight-chain alkanes 

® 
appears at C„H 2 „ +1 (29, 43, 57, 71,...), but for compounds containing func- 
tional groups the positions are shifted due to the presence of heteroatoms. Some 
of the common series are shown in Table 3.4. Unfortunately the series for alde- 
hydes and ketones overlaps the alkyl series since CO and C 2 H 4 are both of mass 
28. Complex molecules may show more than one series. 

Characteristic ion series are also produced by aromatic compounds, the exact 
positions being dependent on the nature of the substituent (Table 3.5). 

Certain types of compounds give characteristic ions in the mass spectrum 
which are often readily picked out and are useful indicators of possible struc-

INTERPRETATION OF THE MASS SPECTRUM 

The following scheme is suggested as a general approach to the interpretation of 
the mass spectrum. Each spectrum presents its own challenge and therefore too 
rigid adherence to any scheme is unwise. Reference should be made to the 
appropriate paragraph of this section for fuller details of each step. 

1. Identify the molecular ion. 

2. Determine the elemental composition and the index of hydrogen deficiency, 
i.e. the number of double bonds and rings. 

3. Make any deductions which are possible from the general appearance of the 
spectrum; identify any ion series and characteristic ions. 

4. Note possible structures of neutral fragments from the presence of high mass 
ions. 

5. Identify any odd-electron ions and consider possible rearrangements (see Re- 
arrangements, p. 371). 

6. Suggest a feasible structure on the basis of the mass spectral and any other 
evidence. Predict the mass spectrum of the postulated compound and com- 
pare with the unknown spectrum. Make any modification to the proposed 
structure which appears necessary. Check the mass spectral behaviour of 
compounds of similar structures by consulting appropriate reference collec- 
tions. 

MASS SPECTRA OF CLASSES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 

Many types of organic compounds exhibit characteristic mass spectral be- 
haviour, a knowledge of which is useful in the interpretation of their spectra. The 
following section provides an introduction to the interpretation of mass spectra 
of simple organic compounds but readers should consult the texts listed in the 
references. 4 Some caution is needed in the application of this information since

the incorporation of additional substituents or functional groups into a mol- 
ecule may well prevent 'characteristic' fragmentation. 

Hydrocarbons. Saturated hydrocarbons. A high energy for ionisation is required 
for alkanes and the ions thus formed undergo random rearrangements. The 
molecular ion is normally present although it may be weak. The spectra nor- 
mally consist of clusters of peaks separated by fourteen mass units correspond- 
ing to a difference of a CH 2 group. The M — CH 3 ion is frequently missing and 
for unbranched alkanes the intensity of other ions increases steadily to reach a 
maximum at m/z 43 (C 3 H^) or m/z 57 (C 4 HcP); these peaks are mainly due to the 
highly branched ions resulting from molecular rearrangements; the spectrum of 
decane, Fig. 3.79(a), is typical. Branched chain hydrocarbons show intense 
peaks corresponding to preferential cleavage at a tertiary or quaternary carbon 
atom; thus the spectrum of 2,6-dimethyloctane, Fig. 3.79(b), shows an intense 
peak at m/z 113 due to loss of an ethyl group and formation of the secondary 
carbocation. Alicyclic hydrocarbons generally show a more abundant molecular 
ion, but the spectra are more difficult to interpret due to random rearrangement. 

Alkenes. These give spectra in which the molecular ion peak is usually distinct 
and there is an increased abundance of the C„Hf„_ x ion series as compared with 
alkanes, as illustrated by the spectrum of hex-1-ene (Fig. 3.80). The location of

Aromatic hydrocarbons. Generally these hydrocarbons give rise to a prominent 
molecular ion as the result of the stabilising effect of the ring; doubly charged 
ions are also often apparent as low-intensity peaks at half integral mass values. 
Alkyl-substituted benzenoid compounds (for example o-xylene, Fig. 3.76) 
usually give rise to a base peak at m/z 91 due to the tropylium ion, C 7 H^. This 
may eliminate a neutral acetylene molecule to give a peak at m/z 65.

Aromatic compounds with alkyl groups having a chain of at least three car-

The characteristic aromatic cluster of ions in alkylbenzenes occurs at m/z 77, 78

Alcohols, phenols, ethers. The molecular ion of alcohols is weak or undetectable. 
Characteristic ions result from alpha-cleavage giving rise to resonance-stabilised 
carbocations ions; the loss of the largest alkyl group is the preferred pathway 
although ions resulting from losses of the other groups may also be observed.

Primary alcohols in particular give an M — 18 peak due to loss of water from 
the molecular ion although this peak may partly arise from thermal decomposi- 
tion of the alcohol in the ion source. Initial migration of a hydrogen on the alkyl 
chain is followed by cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond, see, for example, the 
spectrum of propan-1-ol, Fig. 3.81, which shows strong peaks at m/z 59, 42, 31

Phenols usually give a strong molecular ion. Typical peaks in the spectrum 
arise from M — 28 (CO), which is a useful odd-electron ion, and M — 29 
(CHO). 

The molecular ion peak of ethers is weak or negligible. There are two frag- 
mentation processes which are typical of ethers. A characteristic fragmentation 
is the cleavage of the carbon-oxygen bond. This often gives rise to the most 
abundant ion in the spectrum of aliphatic ethers.

Thiols and thioethers. The molecular ion is normally much more abundant in 
the case of sulphur compounds than with the corresponding oxygen compounds 
due to the lower ionisation energy of the non-bonding sulphur electrons. The 
presence and number of sulphur atoms is usually indicated by the contribution 
of 34 S to the M + 2 peak, and in addition homologous series of fragments con- 
taining sulphur are present having four mass units higher than those of the 
hydrocarbon series. 

Thiols show similar fragmentations to those of alcohols, typical ions arising 
from a-cleavage and from loss of hydrogen sulphide (M — 34).

The more abundant acylium ion is normally produced by loss of the largest 
alkyl group. 

In aromatic aldehydes and ketones the base peak usually arises from 
e 
Ar-feO; compare the spectra of benzaldehyde and acetophenone (Fig. 3.83(a) 

e 
and (b)) which both show intense peaks due to C 6 H 5 -C=0, and further frag- 
mentations typical of aromatic compounds. The a-cleavage reaction is normally 
less significant for aldehydes than for ketones, although a prominent peak at 
m/z 29 (CHO) is sometimes observed. 

McLafferty rearrangements are common for aliphatic aldehydes and ketones, 
providing that an alkyl group of at least three carbons long is attached to the 
carbonyl group. Odd-electron ions are formed which are useful in the analysis of 
the spectrum.

in those cases where the alkyl group, 2 R, is smaller than C 4 . The characteristic

Nitrites. The molecular ion peak is weak or non-existent in aliphatic nitriles but

A typical fragmentation of alkyl chlorides and bromides is the loss of an alkyl 
group with the formation of a halonium ion. The ion forms the base peak in

The information concerning the structure of an organic molecule which may be

383 



3.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



i.r., n.m.r. and mass spectra. The principal features which may be detected are 
multiply bonded systems, conjugated systems and aromatic (and hetero- 
aromatic) nuclei. The electronic transitions in these systems which give rise to 
absorption in the 200-700 nm region are n -» n* and n -&gt; n* and these are of 
diagnostic value (see also Section 2.17.5, p. 106). The n -&gt; a* electronic transi- 
tion which arises in saturated compounds containing the heteroatoms sulphur, 
nitrogen, bromine and iodine is of less importance since it leads to absorption 
just below 200 nm. The corresponding transition in compounds containing oxy- 
gen and chlorine leads to absorption at somewhat shorter wavelengths; indeed, 
the transparency of alcohols and chloroalkanes in the region 200-700 nm makes 
them ideal solvents for u.v. spectral determinations. The a -» a* electronic 
transition in saturated hydrocarbons leads to absorption in the far-ultraviolet. 
Apart from the fact that special techniques are required to record the absorp- 
tion, the information gained is in any event of little diagnostic value. 

INSTRUMENTAL FEATURES OF ULTRAVIOLET- VISIBLE 
SPECTROPHOTOMETERS 

The basic features of ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometers are similar in many 
respects to those described in Section 3.1 for i.r. spectrophotometers. 

Commercial instruments for u.v. usually also cover the visible region and 
therefore have two light sources - a deuterium or hydrogen discharge tube for 
the region 200-370 nm, and a tungsten filament lamp for the region 325-750 nm; 
with recording instruments there is an automatic interchange at 370 nm. The 
monochromator incorporates a quartz prism or diffraction grating. In normal 
circumstances the lower limit of measurement is 190nm owing to the fact that 
oxygen absorbs radiation below 190nm, and quartz becomes less transparent in 
this region. Below 190nm, measurements require the use of diffraction gratings 
and special vacuum techniques. 

Modern instruments are double-beam recording spectrophotometers in 
which the light beam is split into two parallel beams which pass through the 
sample and reference cells and thence to the detector system. As with i.r. spectro- 
photometers, modern instruments include such features as the presentation of 
spectra on a visual display unit, microprocessor control of instrumental con- 
ditions and the storage and analysis of the recorded spectrum using a computer. 
Cells used in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy are made entirely of quartz and are 
available in sizes which provide a path length (i.e. the length of sample in the 
beam of the radiation) varying from 0.5 to 10cm. 

DETERMINATION OF ULTRAVIOLET-VISIBLE SPECTRA 

When a molecule absorbs ultraviolet or visible light of frequency v or wave- 
length A, an electron undergoes a transition from a lower to a higher energy level 
in the molecule. The energy difference A£ is given by the expression: 

A£ = hv = -j- 

where h is Planck's constant and c the velocity of the radiation. Multiplication 
by Avogadro's number, N A (6.02 x 10 23 mol -1 ), will express the energy 
absorbed per mole. By inserting the numerical values for h (6.63 x 10 -37 kJs), 
for c (3 x 10 10 cms -1 ) and using the conversion factor (4.184) to convert kJ 

384 



ULTRAVIOLET-VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY 3.4

119.75 x 10 3 



119.75 x 10 3 
A nm x 4.184 



For the region 200-750 nm, therefore, the energy required for electron transi- 
tions is in the range 600-1 60 kJ mol - '; for the ultraviolet region 200-400 nm, the 
energy is of the same order of magnitude as the bond energies of common co- 
valent bonds (e.g. C — H bond energy is «410kJmol -1 ). For this reason pro- 
longed exposure of the sample to ultraviolet radiation during measurement 
should be avoided to minimise possible decomposition of a proportion of the 
sample. 

Energies of these magnitudes are associated with the promotion of an elec- 
tron from a non-bonding («) orbital or a 7i-orbital, to an antibonding 7i-orbital 
(71*) or to an antibonding &lt;r-orbital (&lt;r*). The most important transitions in 
organic compounds are: 

(a) n -» 7i* transitions; these are usually associated with the multiple bonds of 
carbon with carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, etc., and they generally give 
rise to high intensity absorption; 

(b) n -» n* transitions; these are usually associated with groups such as car- 
bon yl, thiocarbonyl, nitroso, etc., and generally the intensity of absorption is 
very much lower than that arising from (a). 

LAWS OF LIGHT ABSORPTION 

The Beer-Lambert law states that the proportion of light absorbed by a solute 
in a transparent solvent is independent of the intensity of the incident light and is 
proportional to the number of absorbing molecules in the light path: 

logiofyj = A=ecl 

where 

J = intensity of incident light 
I = intensity of transmitted light 
e = molar absorptivity or molar extinction coefficient 
c = concentration of solute in moles/litre 
/ = cell (path) length (cm) 
A = absorbance 

It will therefore be seen that s is a measure of the absorbance of the solution at a 
concentration of 1 mole per litre in a 1 cm cell. Beer's law is a limiting law and is 
strictly valid only at low concentrations. 

When the molecular weight (M) of the absorbing substance is unknown, the 

385 



3.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



extinction coefficient of a 1 per cent solution in a 1 cm cell (/li°4i) is generally 
used for comparison of absorption intensities: 

Alcm cl 

where c is now in grams per 100 ml and / is in cm. It is related to the molar 
absorptivity by the expression 

_ avx M 

Both e and A\%n are independent of concentration or cell length provided the 
Beer-Lambert law is obeyed; the latter constant does not involve the molecular 
weight and is therefore used for compounds of unknown or uncertain constitu- 
tions. 

The u.v. spectrum is a plot of the wavelength or frequency of absorption 
against the absorbance (log 10 Iq/I) or the transmittance (/// ). Spectral data are 
also presented in which the absorbance is expressed as the molar absorptivity, e 
or log e, i.e. as a graphical plot of X versus s or log s. The intensity of an absorp- 
tion band in the u.v. spectrum is usually expressed as the molar absorptivity (e) 
at maximum absorption (A max ). The smaller the difference between ground and 
excited states the longer will be the wavelength of absorption. The latter follows 
from the expression X = hc/AE. Thus absorption of light in the visible region, 
which is responsible for the colour of certain compounds, involves a lower 
energy transition as compared with the absorption of light in the ultraviolet 
region. 

SOLVENTS FOR ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPY 

Organic compounds generally absorb too strongly for their ultraviolet spectra 
to be directly determined, and dilute solutions must be prepared with solvents 
that are transparent to u.v. light over the wavelengths of interest. Fortunately a 
suitable solution of a compound whose u.v. spectrum is required to be recorded 
can usually be prepared, since a reasonably wide selection of solvents which are 
transparent down to about 205 nm is available. These include hexane,* hep- 
tane,* cyclohexane,* iso-octane (2,4,4-trimethylpentane),* chloroform,* tetra- 
hydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane,* propan-2-ol,* ethanol,* methanol,* and water.* In 
the far u.v., suitable solvents are hexane and heptane. Those solvents which are 
commercially available as 'spectroscopically pure' (from, fcr example, Romil 
Chemicals) are marked with an asterisk, although for many purposes analytical 
grade reagents are satisfactory if the cell length is small. It should be noted that 
the value of /l max may be dependent upon solvent polarity, and hence the solvent 
used for the spectral determination should always be specified. 

SOLUTION PREPARATION 

To obtain accurate absorbance values in the region of maximum sensitivity of 
the spectrophotometer it is usual to prepare a solution having a concentration 
which would give an A value at A max in the region of about 0.5 for the manual 
instrument, or about 0.9 for the automatic recording instrument. For a com- 
pound having an s value of the order of 15000, as is found for example in the 
case of crotonaldehyde (x max 220 nm, s 15 000, M 70) and using a path length cell 

386 



ULTRAVIOLET-VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY 3.4 



of 1 cm, substitution in the Beer-Lambert equation: 

log 10 hi I = Ecl 

gives 0.5 = 15000 x c x /; 

whence c = n = 3.33 x 10 -5 moldm -3 

or = 7 ^J^ = 2 .33x KT 3 gdm- 3 

15000 

A solution of this concentration is most usually prepared by weighing (say) 
23 mg (or 2.3 mg) of the substance and dissolving it in 100 ml (or 10 ml) of sol- 
vent using a graduated flask; 1 ml of the solution is then diluted exactly to 100 ml 
with the same solvent. 

OPTICAL CELLS AND THEIR CARE 

Although cells constructed of glass are suitable for the determination of spectra 
in the visible range, this material is not sufficiently transparent in the u.v. region 
and quartz cells must be used. These commonly have path lengths of from 0.5 to 
10 cm; a 1-cm-square cell requires about 3 ml of solution. 

Cells may become contaminated as a result of evaporation of solvent from 
solutions, and also by acquiring a film of grease as a result of careless handling. 
Such films and dust particles decrease transmission and can also contaminate 
liquids placed subsequently in the cell. Immediately after use therefore cells must 
be emptied and rinsed with clean solvent and then cleaned with a suitable deter- 
gent solution and stored in distilled water. A brush which might scratch the op- 
tical surface should never be used. Solid contaminants must always be removed 
by the following wet cleaning procedure: 

(a) stand the cell in cold detergent for 15 minutes; 

(b) rinse several times with distilled water; 

(c) rinse with ethanol and store in covered containers containing distilled water 
or dry under a radiant lamp. Do not allow the cell to dry until the cleaning 
procedure is complete. 

The following precautions in handing cells should also be observed: 

(a) cells should only be handled by means of the etched surfaces; 

(b) when wiping the outside surfaces of the cell, prior to placing in the instru- 
ment, paper tissues only should be used; 

(c) cells should be removed from storage under water with the aid of suitably 
protected tongs. 

The cells are filled bearing in mind the following points. The clean dry cell is 
rinsed with the appropriate solvent and then with the prepared solution before 
being finally filled. For solutions made up with volatile solvents the filled cell 
should be closed with the fitted lid provided; a reference cell is similarly filled 
with the neat solvent. If a cell has been stored under water it is first rinsed well 
with the appropriate solvent and then with a little of the prepared solution 
before being finally filled. If the solvent used is immiscible with water a prelimin- 
ary washing with ethanol is necessary. 

387 



3.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



For accurate work a pair of matched cells should be used and each should be 
placed in the instrument so that the incident radiation enters via the same op- 
tical face every time. 

It is not considered appropriate here to give the details of the operation of the 
spectrophotometer; the manual provided by the manufacturers for a particular 
instrument available should be consulted. 

FEATURES OF AN ULTRAVIOLET-VISIBLE SPECTRUM 

In the spectra of simple molecules the absorptions due to n -» 71* transitions lie 
at longer wavelengths than those arising from the n -» n* excitations which is 
of course a measure of the lower energy required for electron promotion in the 
former case. The absorption occurs over a range of wavelengths about discern- 
ible maxima leading most frequently in solution to a broad absorption curve. 
This is because the spacing between the rotational and vibrational transitions of 
a polyatomic molecule are relatively small (about 0.5-4.2 kJmol -1 ) and elec- 
tron transitions occur (with corresponding slight differences of energy) from a 
range of vibrational-rotational levels in the ground state to a range of such 
levels in the excited state. 

The term chromophore is used to describe any structural feature which leads 
to absorption in the ultraviolet-visible region and includes groups in which 
n -&gt; n*, n -» n* and n -» a* transitions are possible. The term auxochrome is 
used to designate groups possessing non-bonding electron pairs which are con- 
jugated with a 71-bond system; an example is a hydroxyl or amino group 
attached to an aromatic ring system. Such n-n conjugation leads to a shift of 
absorption to longer wavelengths, referred to as a bathochromic shift; conversely 
a shift to shorter wavelengths is descibed as a hypsochromic shift. 

Apart from the wavelength of maximum absorption (A max ), the intensity of 
absorption (e, the molar extinction coefficient) is of value in elucidating struc- 
tural features. A high e value (5000-10000) reflects a high probability of the 
occurrence of the relevant electronic transition and is observable in systems in 
which the relative symmetry of the ground and the excited state is such as to lead 
to a change in the transition moment. When this symmetry requirement is not 
met, the transition is regarded as being 'forbidden', and as a consequence the 
probability is low and the e value is usually less than 100. For example, the 
n -» 71* transition in a ketone, such as acetone, leads to absorption at 
A max 280nm, e 13. Changes in the molecular environment adjacent to a chromo- 
phore may either increase or decrease the intensity of the absorption and such 
correlations may be of help in the interpretation of spectra. The magnitude of 
the e value is also dependent upon such factors as the polarity of the solvent and 
the extent to which the ground and excited states are stabilised by solvation. 

The carbon-carbon multiple bond. An isolated carbon-carbon double bond ab- 
sorbs near 180nm (e « 15000) as a result of a n -» n* electronic transition. 
Alkyl groups cause small bathochromic shifts so that a tetrasubstituted acyclic 
alkene absorbs in the region of 200 nm (see Table 3.6). 

An isolated carbon-carbon triple bond similarly absorbs in the 180nm 
region (acetylene, /Uax 173 nm, s « 6000); the absorption maximum is shifted to 
longer wavelengths by the presence of alkyl groups (Table 3.6). 

Conjugation of multiple carbon-carbon double bonds leads to significant 
changes in A max and in the s value. For example, buta-l,3-diene has A max 217 nm, s

21 000, and there is a regular bathochromic shift with an increase in the number 
of conjugated double bonds (Table 3.7). Alkyl substituents attached to the mul- 
tiply bonded carbon atoms have also been found to lead to uniform increments 
(5 nm) in the wavelength of absorption. 

Conjugation of the carbon-carbon triple bond with other triple bonds (poly- 
ynes) or with carbon-carbon double bonds (polyenynes) also leads to progres- 
sive shifts of A max to higher wavelengths. In acyclic systems such absorptions are 
frequently of diagnostic value in deciding the extent of conjugation. 

The regularity of wavelength shifts associated with changes in the extent of 
conjugation, the degree of substitution and the geometrical relationship of the 
double-bond system has led to the formulation of a set of empirical rules which 
enable the absorption maxima of substituted conjugated dienes to be predicted. 
Hence in cases where two isomeric structures are feasible, comparison of the cal- 
culated and experimental A max often enables a structural assignment to be made. 

In formulating the rules (Table 3.8) for cyclic dienes, these are classified as 
either heteroannular or homoannular, e.g. 





Heteroannular 



Homoannular 



The base A max value for the former is taken as 214 nm and for the latter as 
253 nm. To these values are added increments according to the nature of the 
substituent present and other structural features as shown in the table. In those 
cases where homoannular and heteroannular chromophores coexist in conjuga- 
tion, the base value for the homoannular contribution is used, to which is added 
the appropriate increment for extended conjugation. It should also be noted that 
homoannular dienes in ring systems other than the six-membered ring do not 
give a satisfactory correlation between calculated and experimentally deter- 
mined A max values. The rules however are adequate for acyclic or heteroannular

dienes providing that there exists in the structure no geometrical constraint 
which leads to a departure from coplanarity of the &lt;r-bond system and to a con- 
sequent reduction in 71-orbital overlap. 

The carbonyl group. Acetone (in cyclohexane solution) exhibits two absorption 
bands; one appears at 190nm (e 1860) and corresponds to the n -» n* transi- 
tion, while the second is at 280 nm (e 1 3) and corresponds to the n -» 71* transi- 
tion. The absorption maxima of these bands are solvent-dependent. Ultraviolet 
spectra of saturated aldehydes, carboxylic acids, esters and lactones exhibit a 
similar absorption profile, and in general are of little diagnostic value. 

Conjugation of the carbonyl group with a carbon-carbon double bond, how- 
ever, significantly alters the absorption pattern. Thus the absorption corres- 
ponding to electron promotion from the carbon-carbon 71-system to the 
antibonding orbital of the carbonyl group (the electron-transfer or E.T. band) is 
found in the region of 220 to 250 nm (e 10000-15 000) for simple enones; the 
term E.T. band is reserved for n -» n* transitions in which the conjugated 
chromophores are dissimilar. A weak band (e 50-100) is also to be found in the 
region 3 10-330 nm and is due to the displaced n -» 71* transition of the car- 
bonyl group. 

The position of the E.T. band depends in a predictable manner upon the 
extent of conjugation, the degree of substitution, etc., and may be calculated 
following rules which are analogous to those available for the prediction of 
absorption characteristics of conjugated dienes and which are set out in Table 
3.9. The base values selected are 215 nm for an enone in an acyclic or six- 
membered ring system, or 202 nm for an enone system in a five-membered ring, 
or 207 nm for an a,/?-unsaturated aldehyde. 

Aromatic compounds. These compounds exhibit characteristic absorption in the 
ultraviolet-visible region of the spectrum, and although they are frequently 
easily recognised from their other spectroscopic properties, examination of their 
electronic spectra can often lead to the elucidation or confirmation of some of 
the detailed structural features. 

Hydrocarbons. Benzene (in hexane solution) exhibits three absorption bands, 
A l5 A 2 and A 3 , which occur at 184 nm (e60000), 204 nm (e7400) and 254 nm

Alkyl substituents cause a bathochromic shift of the A 2 and 1 3 bands with little 
change in the e value (see Table 3.11). 

Polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons with both angular and linear types of ring 
fusion show absorption curves of a similar profile to that of benzene but with the 
absorption maxima shifted to longer wavelengths; the greater the number of 
rings the more pronounced the shift. 



391 



3.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Substituted benzenoid systems. As noted above, alkyl substituents cause a small 
bathochromic shift in the X 2 and 1 3 bands, and a similar effect is observed in the 
case of halogen substituents. However, substituents which contain multiply 
bonded groups (C=0, N0 2 , C=N, C=C, CsC), and to a lesser degree substit- 
uents having non-bonding electrons in conjugation with the aromatic rc-system, 
cause very pronounced bathochromic shifts of the two bands; this is frequently 
coupled with an increase in the e value of the 1 3 band. In some cases additional 
bands will appear in the spectrum as a result of electron transitions associated 
with the substituent group (e.g. acetophenone n -» 71*, l max 320, s 50). The 
effects of a selection of these groups on the positions of the X u X 2 and 1 3 bands 
may be gathered from the data cited in Table 3.11.

t The solvents employed are (a) hexane, (b) methanol, (c) ethano! and (d) water containing suffi- 
cient methanol to ensure miscibility. 

The origin of these bathocromic shifts lies in the more extensive mesomerism 
that exists in these derivatives, which thus reduces the energy difference between 
the ground and the excited states, and hence shifts the absorption to longer 
wavelength. Such aspects are dealt with in more detail in the specialist texts. 5 

Heterocyclic systems. Pyridine exhibits an absorption spectrum very similar to 
that of benzene with an additional absorption band at 270 nm which is assigned 
to the transition involving the nitrogen lone pair. Similarly quinoline and iso- 
quinoline have spectral profiles closely analogous to naphthalene. 

The five-membered heterocycles (furan, thiophene and pyrrole), despite their

aromaticity, show distinct spectral differences from benzene. For example, furan 
has l max 200, 205 and 211 nm; thiophene has l max 235 nm, and pyrrole has l max 
210 and 240 nm.

CHAPTER 4 

SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 



4.1 THE PURIFICATION OF COMMON ORGANIC SOLVENTS 1 

Physical data of solvents which are commonly used in the organic chemistry 
laboratory are tabulated in Appendix 5. 

Commercially available grades of organic solvents are of adequate purity for 
use in many reactions provided that the presence of small quantities of water 
(the most widespread impurity in all organic solvents) is not harmful to the 
course of the reaction, and also that the presence of other impurities (e.g. ethanol 
in diethyl ether) is unlikely to cause undesirable side reactions. The commerci- 
ally available grades for general use are often accompanied by specifications 
indicating the amount and nature of any impurities present. 

When the levels of impurities, including moisture, are unacceptable for 
particular reactions, and when large volumes of such solvents are likely to be 
required, it is frequently more economic to purify the commercial grades than to 
purchase the more expensive AnalaR grades. Solvents of the appropriate grade 
of purity should also be used in isolation (extraction) and purification 
(recrystallisation) processes, particularly in the latter stages immediately prior 
to spectroscopic and/or elemental analysis. 

An account of the more important common drying agents and their use in 
drying solutions of organic compounds has already been given (Section 2.23). 
Although the drying efficiency of the individual desiccants cited differs 
considerably, many of them are of value for the preliminary drying procedures 
for the vast majority of organic solvents. This preliminary treatment is in fact 
essential, unless it is certain that the water content is very low, before using the 
more powerful drying agents (such as a reactive metal, e.g. sodium, or a metal 
hydride, e.g. calcium hydride, lithium aluminium hydride). These latter drying 
agents remove the remaining traces of water from solvents which are required 
for reactions necessitating strictly anhydrous conditions. Attention should be 
drawn to the considerable fire or explosion hazards of these highly reactive 
drying agents, particularly at the end of a solvent distillation when residual 
material has to be disposed of. Recommended methods of safely destroying 
sodium metal and metal hydrides are given in Section 2.3. 

While the drying agent selected for preliminary and final drying must of 
course have no chemical action on the organic solvent, with some solvents a 
specific chemical treatment is necessary to remove impurities other than water 
before drying is attempted. Apart from impurities arising during the manu- 
facturing processes, many organic solvents undergo autoxidation on standing 

395 



4.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



with the formation of dangerously explosive peroxides. Such solvents should 
always be tested for the presence of peroxides, and if present these should be 
removed according to the methods detailed below under individual examples, 
before other purification processes are attempted. 

The purified and dried solvent is then distilled; separation from contaminants 
of similar boiling point may require the use of an efficient fractionating column, 
and high boiling solvents may need to be distilled under reduced pressure. It 
must be remembered that many of the common organic solvents are markedly 
toxic - benzene and the halogenated hydrocarbons are notorious examples, but 
many others are potentially hazardous to varying degrees (see Section 2.3), and 
the inhalation of vapour should always be avoided. Almost all organic solvents 
are also flammable; the more volatile compounds, notably ether and carbon 
disulphide, are particularly hazardous in consequence. Apart from taking the 
obvious precautions of avoiding all flames in the vicinity of a solvent distillation, 
it must be remembered that faulty electrical connections or even contact with 
hot metal surfaces may ignite the vapour of volatile solvents. The capacity of the 
condensing system used must be fully adequate to cope with the volume of 
solvent distilled, and double surface condensers are essential in many cases. 

Rigorously dried organic solvents are frequently markedly hygroscopic. The 
distillation assembly may be protected by a suitable drying tube, but the 
distillation is better carried out under an atmosphere of nitrogen and the 
distilled solvent similarly stored under nitrogen. If the solvent is stored in a 
multi-necked flask fitted with a nitrogen inlet and outlet tube, a measured 
amount of solvent can be removed by syringe with little or no contamination of 
the solvent with air or moisture. The reader is referred to Section 2.17.8, p. 120 
for a detailed description of these procedures. When quantities of dry solvents 
are required regularly, it is convenient to store the solvent over a drying agent 
and under a nitrogen atmosphere. Dry solvent is then distilled off and used 
immediately as required. An example is described below for dioxane, Section 
4.1.20, p. 407. 

It is often convenient to remove final traces of water with the aid of a 
molecular sieve and to store the dried solvent in the presence of the sieve. The 
descriptive term, molecular sieve, applies to a group of dehydrated synthetic 
sodium and calcium aluminosilicate adsorbents (zeolites)* which have a crystal 
lattice structure incorporating uniformly sized holes or pores which are able to 
accept molecules smaller than a limiting dimension; the larger molecules do not 
diffuse into the lattice structure. This selectivity, based upon molecular shape 
and dimension, accounts for the sieving action and is particularly valuable for 
the removal from gases and liquids of water, which readily diffuses into the pores 
and is retained by a strong adsorptive attraction.! The pore size is determined 
by the nature of the manufacturing process and currently four principal types 
are available in bead, pellet or powder forms, namely Types 3 A, 4A, 5A and 1 3X, 
representing an effective pore diameter of approximately 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 and 1.0 nm 
respectively. All these are stable over a pH range 5-11 but interaction with 



* The first synthetic zeolites were known as Linde Molecular Sieves but are now marketed as 
'Union Carbide' Molecular Sieves; they are available from Union Carbide International Company, 
USA. or Union Carbide (UK) Ltd directly, or through the usual chemical suppliers. 
t Booklets giving detailed information on the structure, action and applications of molecular sieves 
are available from most suppliers of laboratory chemicals.

SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.1 



strong acids is to be avoided; grades are available which are more resistant to 
the action of acid (e.g. AW-300, AW-500). 

Types 3A, 4A and 5A are those which are most usually employed for drying 
purposes; 5A is also capable of adsorbing the higher homologues of straight 
chain alkanes, alkenes and alcohols. Their adsorptive capacity for water is 
higher than that of silica gel, alumina or activated charcoal. The use of 
powdered molecular sieves has recently been recommended as an efficient 
method for drying some of the lower alcohols. After use molecular sieves may be 
readily regenerated by heating between 150 and 300 °C in a suitable oven or in a 
stream of dry air and then cooling in a desiccator. 

Solvents used for the preparation of solutions for spectroscopic examination 
(particularly infrared measurements) need to be rigorously purified or spectro- 
scopic grades must be purchased (see Chapter 3). Even in this latter case, and 
particularly with the more hygroscopic solvents, the solvent may become 
contaminated with moisture during usage of the solvent from a previously 
opened bottle. It is therefore advisable to dry the solvent immediately before use 
by means of a molecular sieve. 

SATURATED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS 

1. LIGHT PETROLEUM* 

The fractions of refined petroleum which are commonly used have b.p. 40-60, 
60-80, 80-100 and 100-120°C. It is not advisable to employ a fraction with a 
wider b.p. range than 20 °C, because of possible loss of the more volatile portion 
during its use in recrystallisation, etc., and consequent different solubility 
relationships with the higher boiling residue. For some purposes the presence of 
unsaturated (chiefly aromatic) hydrocarbons in light petroleum is undesirable. 
Most of the unsaturated hydrocarbons may be removed by shaking two or three 
times with 10 per cent of the volume of concentrated sulphuric acid (for details, 
see under Benzene); vigorous shaking is then continued with successive portions 
of a concentrated solution of potassium permanganate in 10 per cent sulphuric 
acid until the colour of the permanganate remains unchanged. The solvent is 
then thoroughly washed with sodium carbonate solution and then with water, 
dried over anhydrous calcium chloride and distilled. If required perfectly dry, it 
should be allowed to stand over sodium wire (see 75. Diethyl ether below), or 
calcium hydride. 

More recently a convenient method of purification has been recommended! 
which is to decant the solvent, previously treated with sulphuric acid, directly on 
to a basic alumina (Grade I) column using about 50 g of adsorbent for each 
100 ml of solvent; the first 5 per cent of eluate is discarded. The column receiver 
should be suitably protected from the ingress of moisture by the attachment of a 
calcium chloride tube. This method also removes any peroxides which may be 
present. 

Light petroleum fractions free from aromatic hydrocarbons are marketed, as 



* Also known as petroleum ether and sometimes termed ligroin when referring to fractions of b.p. 
above 100 C. 

t Details abstracted from M. Woelm information leaflets. It should be particularly noted that 
peroxides remain unchanged on alumina, which must therefore not be heated; the used alumina 
should be thoroughly wetted before throwing away.

4.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



are the pure homologues, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, etc. While some of 
these latter are available in spectroscopically pure grades, their purification for 
spectroscopic use may be readily achieved by passing through a chromato- 
graphic column having silica gel (Grade I) in the lower section and basic 
alumina (Grade I) in the upper section. 

Similar purification procedures apply to cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane and 
the decalins. 

The purity of all these hydrocarbon solvents may be checked by gas-liquid 
chromatography (Section 2.31) using an Apiezon, a Silicone oil or an SE-52 
silicone rubber gum chromatographic column. 

AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS 

2. BENZENE 

Benzene has been identified as a carcinogen. (CAUTION: All procedures 
involving benzene must be carried out in a well-ventilated fume cupboard, and 
protective gloves should be worn.) The analytical reagent grade benzene is 
satisfactory for most purposes; if required dry, it is first treated with anhydrous 
calcium chloride, filtered and then placed over sodium wire (for experimental 
details, see under 75. Diethyl ether) or a Type 5A molecular sieve. Phosphorus 
pentoxide, lithium aluminium hydride or calcium hydride may be used as 
alternatives to sodium wire. 

Commercial benzene may contain thiophene C 4 H 4 S, b.p. 84 °C, which 
cannot be separated by distillation or by fractional crystallisation. The presence 
of thiophene may be detected by shaking 3 ml of benzene with a solution of 
10 mg of isatin in 10 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and allowing the mixture 
to stand for a short time: a bluish-green coloration is produced if thiophene is 
present. The thiophene may be removed from benzene by shaking with 
concentrated sulphuric acid, advantage being taken of the fact that 
thiophene is more readily sulphonated then benzene. The technical benzene is 
shaken repeatedly with about 15 per cent of its volume of concentrated 
sulphuric acid in a stoppered separatory funnel* until the acid layer is colourless 
or very pale yellow on standing, or until the thiophene test is negative. After each 
shaking lasting a few minutes, the mixture is allowed to settle and the lower layer 
is drawn off. The benzene is then shaken twice with water in order to remove 
most of the acid, once with 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution, again with 
water and finally dried with anhydrous calcium chloride. After nitration, the 
benzene is distilled through an efficient column and the fraction, b.p. 80-8 1 °C, 
collected. If required perfectly dry the distilled benzene may either be stored over 
sodium wire or left in the presence of a Type 5A molecular sieve. Pure benzene 
has b.p. 80°C/760mmHg and m.p. 5.5 °C. 

3. TOLUENE 

Toluene free from sulphur compounds may be purchased. Commercial toluene 
may contain methyl thiophenes (thiotolenes), b.p. 112-1 13 °C, which cannot be 
removed by distillation. It may be purified with concentrated sulphuric acid in a 
similar manner to the purification of benzene, but care must be taken that the 

* Alternatively, the mixture may be stirred mechanically for 20-30 minutes. After three such 
treatments, the acid usually has only a pale colour. 

398 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.1 



temperature is not allowed to rise unduly ( &lt; 30 °C) as toluene is sulphonated 
more easily then benzene. If required perfectly dry the distilled toluene may be 
stored over sodium wire, phosphorus pentoxide, or calcium hydride, or left in 
the presence of a Type 5A grade of molecular sieve. Pure toluene has b.p. 
110.5°C/760mmHg. 

4. XYLENES 

For solvent purposes various grades of xylenes (the mixture of isomers and 
ethylbenzene) are available; purification and drying procedures are similar to 
those used for benzene and toluene. For chemical purposes the commercially 
available pure isomeric xylenes are usually available in at least 99 per cent 
purity. 

HALOGENATED HYDROCARBONS 

5. DICHLOROMETHANE (Methylene chloride) 

The commercial grade is purified by washing with portions of concentrated 
sulphuric acid until the acid layer remains colourless, and then with water, 
sodium carbonate solution and water again. It is dried initially over calcium 
chloride and then distilled from calcium hydride before use. The fraction b.p. 40- 
41 °C is collected. Dichloromethane should be stored in a brown bottle away 
from light over Type 3A molecular sieve. 

Dichloromethane is a useful substitute for diethyl ether in extraction 
processes when it is desired to employ a solvent which is more dense than water. 

6. CHLOROFORM 

(CAUTION: Chloroform is a suspect carcinogen; wherever possible it should be 
replaced by dichloromethane as an extraction solvent.) The commercial product 
contains up to 1 per cent of ethanol which is added as a stabiliser. The ethanol 
may be removed by any of the following procedures: 

(a) The chloroform is shaken five or six times with about half its volume of 
water, then dried over anhydrous calcium chloride for at least 24 hours, and 
distilled. 

(b) The chloroform is shaken two or three times with a small volume (say 5%) 
of concentrated sulphuric acid, thoroughly washed with water, dried over 
anhydrous calcium chloride or anhydrous potassium carbonate and 
distilled. 

(c) The chloroform is passed through a column of basic alumina (Grade I; 10 g 
per 14 ml of solvent), a procedure which also removes traces of water and 
acid; the eluate may be used directly. 

Alternative drying agents for chloroform are phosphorus pentoxide, calcium 
sulphate, or powdered Type 4A molecular sieve. 

Pure chloroform has b.p. 61 °C/760mmHg. It must not be dried by standing 
with sodium or an explosion may occur. The solvent, when free of alcohol, should be 
kept in the dark in order to avoid the photochemical formation of dangerous 
quantities of phosgene. 

7. CARBON TETRACHLORIDE 

CAUTION: Carbon tetrachloride is a suspect carcinogen; avoid breathing vapour 
and contact with the skin or eyes. 

399 



4.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The analytical reagent product is sufficiently pure for most purposes; the carbon 
disulphide content does not usually exceed 0.005 per cent. The technical product 
may contain up to 4 per cent of carbon disulphide; this may be removed by the 
following method. One litre of commercial carbon tetrachloride is treated with 
potassium hydroxide (1.5 times the quantity required to combine with the 
carbon disulphide) dissolved in an equal weight of water and 100 ml of rectified 
spirit, and the mixture is shaken vigorously for 30 minutes at 50-60 °C. After 
washing with water, the process is repeated with half the quantity of potassium 
hydroxide. Ethanol is then removed by shaking several times with 500 ml of 
water, followed by shaking with small portions of concentrated sulphuric acid 
until there is no further coloration. The carbon tetrachloride is then washed with 
water, dried over anhydrous calcium chloride and distilled. Further purification 
may be effected, if necessary, by passing the distilled solvent through a column of 
alumina and then allowing it to stand in the presence of a Type 5A molecular 
sieve and finally distilling before use. The pure compound has b.p. 
76.5°C/760mmHg. Carbon tetrachloride must not be dried over sodium, as an 
explosion may result. Fire extinguishers containing this solvent cannot be applied 
to a fire originating from sodium or similarly reactive metals. 

Carbon tetrachloride is one of the solvents which may be dried relatively 
efficiently by simple distillation, rejecting the first 10 per cent of distillate, until 
the distillate is clear (compare Section 2.23). 

ALIPHATIC ALCOHOLS 

8. METHANOL 

The synthetic methanol now available is suitable for most purposes without 
purification: indeed some manufacturers claim a purity of 99.85 per cent with 
not more than 0. 1 per cent by weight of water and not more than 0.02 per cent 
by weight of acetone. 

Most of the water may be removed from commercial methanol by distillation 
through an efficient fractionating column (Fig. 2.106); no constant boiling point 
mixture is formed as is the case with ethanol. Anhydrous methanol can be 
obtained from the fractionally distilled solvent by standing over a Type 3A 
molecular sieve or by treatment with magnesium metal using the procedure 
given for super-dry ethanol described below. It should be stored over Type 3A 
molecular sieve beads. Pure methanol has b.p. 65 °C/760 mmHg. 

If the small proportion of acetone present in synthetic methanol is objec- 
tionable it may be removed when present in quantities up to 1 per cent by the 
following procedure (Morton and Mark, 1934). A mixture of 500 ml of 
methanol, 25 ml of furfural and 60 ml of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution 
is refluxed in a 2-litre round-bottomed flask, fitted with a double surface 
condenser, for 6-12 hours. A resin is formed which carries down all the acetone 
present. The alcohol is then fractionated through an efficient column, the first 
5 ml which may contain a trace of formaldehyde being rejected. The recovery of 
methanol is about 95 per cent. 

9. ETHANOL 

Ethanol of a high degree of purity is frequently required in preparative organic 
chemistry. For some purposes ethanol of c. 99.5 per cent purity is satisfactory; 
this grade may be purchased (the 'absolute alcohol' of commerce), or it may be 

400 



SOLVENTS ANO REAGENTS 4.1 



conveniently prepared by the dehydration of rectified spirit with calcium oxide. 
Rectified spirit is the constant boiling point mixture which ethanol forms with 
water, and usually contains 95.6 per cent of ethanol by weight. Whenever the 
term 'rectified spirit' is used in this book, approximately 95 per cent ethanol is 
to be understood. Ethanol which has been denatured by the incorporation of 
certain toxic additives, notably methanol, to render it unfit for consumption, 
constitutes the industrial spirit (industrial methylated spirit, IMS) of commerce; it 
is frequently a suitable solvent for recrystallisations. 

Dehydration of rectified spirit by calcium oxide. Pour the contents of a 
Winchester bottle of rectified spirit (2-2.25 litres) into a 3-litre round-bottomed 
flask and add 500 g of calcium oxide which has been freshly ignited in a muffle 
furnace and allowed to cool in a desiccator. Fit the flask with a double surface 
condenser carrying a calcium chloride guard-tube, reflux the mixture gently for 
6 hours (preferably using a heating mantle) and allow to stand overnight. 
Reassemble the condenser for downward distillation via a splash head adapter 
to prevent carry-over of the calcium oxide in the vapour stream. Attach a 
receiver flask with a side-arm receiver adapter which is protected by means of a 
calcium chloride guard-tube. Distil the ethanol gently discarding the first 20ml 
of distillate. Preserve the absolute ethanol (99.5%) in a bottle with a well fitting 
stopper. 

'Super-dry' ethanol. The yields in several organic preparations (e.g. malonic 
ester syntheses, reductions involving sodium and ethanol, etc.) are considerably 
improved by the use of ethanol of 99.8 per cent purity or higher. This very high 
grade ethanol may be prepared in several ways from commercial absolute 
alcohol or from the product of dehydration of rectified spirit with calcium oxide. 
The method of Lund and Bjerrum depends upon the reactions: 

Mg + 2EtOH &gt; H 2 + Mg(OEt) 2 (1) 

Mg(OEt) 2 + 2H 2 &gt; Mg(OH) 2 + 2EtOH (2) 

Reaction (1) usually proceeds readily provided the magnesium is activated with 
iodine and the water content does not exceed 1 per cent. Subsequent interaction 
between the magnesium ethanolate and water gives the highly insoluble 
magnesium hydroxide; only a slight excess of magnesium is therefore necessary. 

Fit a dry 1 .5- or 2-litre round-bottomed flask with a double surface condenser 
and a calcium chloride guard-tube. Place 5 g of clean dry magnesium turnings 
and 0.5 g of iodine in the flask, followed by 50-75 ml of commercial absolute 
ethanol. Warm the mixture until the iodine has disappeared: if a lively evolution 
of hydrogen does not set in, add a further 0.5 g portion of iodine. Continue 
heating until all the magnesium is converted into ethanolate, then add 900 ml of 
commercial absolute ethanol and reflux the mixture for 30 minutes. Distil off the 
ethanol directly into the vessel in which it is to be stored, using an apparatus 
similar to that described for the dehydration of rectified spirit. The purity of the 
ethanol exceeds 99.95 per cent provided adequate precautions are taken to 
protect the distillate from atmospheric moisture. The super-dry ethanol is 
exceedingly hygroscopic; it may with advantage be stored over a Type 4A 
molecular sieve. 

If the alcohol is required for conductivity or other physico-chemical work and 
traces of bases are objectionable, these may be removed by redistillation from a 

401 



4.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



little 2,4,6-trinitrobenzoic acid. This acid is selected because it is not esterified 
by alcohols, consequently no water is introduced into the alcohol. 

10. PROPAN-1-OL 

The purest available commercial propan-1-ol (propyl alcohol) should be dried 
with anhydrous potassium carbonate or with anhydrous calcium sulphate, and 
distilled through an efficient fractionating column. The fraction, b.p. 96.5- 
97.5°C/760mmHg, is collected. If the propan-1-ol is required perfectly dry, it 
may be treated with magnesium activated with iodine by the method described 
above for ethanol. 

11. PROPAN-2-OL 

Two technical grades of propan-2-ol (isopropyl alcohol) are usually marketed 
having purities of 91 per cent and 99 per cent respectively. The former has a b.p. 
of about 80.3 °C and is a constant boiling point mixture with water. Propan-2-ol 
may contain peroxide, which if present must be removed before dehydration is 
attempted. Therefore test for peroxide by adding 0.5 ml of propan-2-ol to 1 ml of 
10 per cent potassium iodide solution acidified with 0.5 ml of dilute (1:5) 
hydrochloric acid and mixed with a few drops of starch solution just prior to the 
test: if a blue (or blue-black) coloration appears in one minute, the test is 
positive. To remove peroxide heat under reflux 1 litre of propan-2-ol with 10-15 g 
of solid tin(n) chloride for half an hour. Test a portion of the cooled solution for 
peroxide: if iodine is liberated, add further 5 g portions of tin(n) chloride and 
heat under reflux for half-hour periods until the test is negative. Add about 200 g 
of calcium oxide and heat under reflux for 4 hours, and then distil, discarding the 
first portion of distillate. The water content may be further reduced by allowing 
the distillate to stand over calcium metal or a Type 5A molecular sieve for 
several days, followed by further fractionation. Anhydrous propan-2-ol has b.p. 
82-83 'C/760mmHg. It should be noted that peroxide generally redevelops 
during several days. 

12. HIGHER ALCOHOLS 

Absolutely dry butan-2-ol (s-butyl alcohol) is required for the estimation of 
alkyllithium reagents (Section 4.2.27, p. 443). It can be dried by standing for 3 to 
6 hours over powdered Type 3A molecular sieve. Removal of the last traces of 
powder may require distillation or filtration, but standing for several days 
allows the desiccant to settle. 2-Methylpropan-2-ol (t-butyl alcohol) may be 
dried in a similar manner. These and other higher alcohols may also be purified 
by drying with anhydrous potassium carbonate or with anhydrous calcium 
sulphate, and fractionated after filtration from the desiccant in apparatus with 
ground glass joints. The boiling points of the fractions to be collected are as 
follows: 

Butan-1-ol (butyl alcohol), b.p. 1 16.5-1 18 °C/760mmHg. 
2-Methylpropan-l-ol (isobutyl alcohol), b.p. 106.5-107.5 °C/760mmHg. 
Butan-2-ol {s-butyl alcohol), b.p. 99-100°C/760mmHg. 
2-Methylpropan-2-ol (t-butyl alcohol), b.p. 81.5-82.5 °C/7 60 mmHg, m.p. 

25.5 °C. 
Pentan-1-ol (amyl alcohol), b.p. 136-137.5 °C/7 60 mmHg. 
3-Methylbutan-l-ol (isoamyl alcohol), b.p. 130-131 °C/760mmHg. 
Hexan-1-ol (hexyl alcohol), b.p. 156.5-1 57.5 °C/760 mmHg. 

402 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.1 



If perfectly anhydrous alcohols are required these may in general be obtained 
by treatment with sodium followed by addition of the corresponding alkyl 
succinate or phthalate. Sodium alone cannot be used for the complete removal 
of water in an alcohol owing to the equilibrium between the resulting sodium 
hydroxide and the alcohol: 

NaOH + ROH ^=± RONa + H 2 

The purpose of adding the ester is to remove the sodium hydroxide by the 
saponification reaction: 

CH 2 -C0 2 R CH 2 -C0 2 Na 

1 + 2NaOH »■ | + 2ROH 

CH 2 -C0 2 R CH 2 -C0 2 Na 

Typically 7 g of sodium metal are added to 1 litre of butan-2-ol (having no more 
than 0.5% of water) contained in a two-necked flask fitted with a double surface 
condenser. When all the metal has reacted (some warming may be necessary to 
increase the speed of reaction), 33 g of pure 2-butyl succinate or 41 g of pure 2- 
butyl phthalate are added and the mixture is heated under gentle reflux for 

2 hours. Distillation through a Vigreux column affords a distillate containing 
not more than 0.05 per cent of water. 

13. MONO-ALKYL ETHERS OF ETHYLENE GLYCOL, 

ROCH 2 -CH 2 OH 

The monomethyl, ethyl and butyl ethers are inexpensive and are known as 
methyl cellosolve, cellosolve and butyl cellosolve respectively. They are com- 
pletely miscible with water, and are excellent solvents. The commercial products 
are purified by drying over anhydrous potassium carbonate or anhydrous 
calcium sulphate, followed by fractionation after the removal of the desiccant. 
See 'carbitols 1 below for removal of peroxide. The boiling points of the pure 
products are: 

Ethylene glucol monomethyl ether (or 2-methoxyethanol), b.p. 124.5 °C/

The monomethyl, ethyl and butyl ethers are inexpensive commercial products 
and are known as methyl carbitol, carbitol and butyl carbitol respectively. They 
are all completely miscible with water and are purified as already described for 
the 'cellosolves' above. The boiling points of the pure compounds are: 

Diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, b.p. 194°C/760mmHg 
Diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, b.p. 1 98.5 °C/7 60 mmHg 
Diethylene glycol monobutyl ether, b.p. 230.5 °C/7 60 mmHg 

The cellosolve and carbitol solvents may contain traces of peroxide. These 
can be removed either by heating under reflux over anhydrous tin(n) chloride 
(see 11. Propan-2-ol) or by filtration under slight pressure through a column of 
activated basic alumina (Grade I); the used alumina should be saturated with 
water before being discarded.

ETHERS 

15. DIETHYL ETHER (Ether)* 

The chief impurities in commercial ether are water and ethanol. Furthermore, 
when ether is allowed to stand for some time in contact with air and exposed to 
light, slight oxidation occurs with the formation of the highly explosive diethyl 
peroxide (Et 2 3 ). The danger from this unstable compound becomes apparent 
at the conclusion of the distillation of impure ether, when the comparatively 
non-volatile peroxide becomes concentrated in the residue in the distillation 
flask, and a serious explosion may then result if an attempt is made to evaporate 
the ether to dryness. It is perhaps worthy of comment in this connection that in 
the extraction of an organic compound with ether and the subsequent removal 
of the solvent, the presence of the residual compound seems largely to eliminate 
the danger due to traces of peroxide, due presumably to its catalytic effect which 
leads to a more controlled decomposition. Nevertheless ether which has been 
standing for several months in a partially filled bottle exposed to light and air 
should be tested for peroxide by the procedure described under 11. Propan-2-ol. 
If present, the peroxide may be removed by shaking 1 litre of ether with 10-20 ml 
of a concentrated solution of an iron(n) salt prepared either by dissolving 60 g of 
iron(n) sulphate in a mixture of 6 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and 1 10 ml 
of water, or by dissolving lOOg of iron(n) chloride in a mixture of 42 ml of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 85 ml of water.f 

Peroxide may also be removed by shaking with an aqueous solution of 
sodium sulphite or with solid tin(n) chloride (see 11. Propan-2-ol) or by passage 
through a column of alumina. It is worthy of note that all dialkyl ethers have a 
tendency to form explosive peroxides and they should be routinely tested before 
further purification leading to a final distillation process is attempted. 

Apart from the dangers inherent in the use of diethyl ether due to the presence 
of peroxide, attention must be directed to the fact that ether is highly flammable 
and also extremely volatile (b.p. 35 °C), and great care should be taken that there 
is no naked flame in the vicinity of the liquid (see Section 2.3). Under no 
circumstances should ether be distilled over a bare flame, but always from a steam 
bath or an electrically-heated water bath and with a highly efficient double 
surface condenser. Ether vapour has been known to ignite on contact with a hot 
plate or even a hot tripod upon which a water bath has previously been heated. 

Purification of commercial ether. Divide the contents of a Winchester bottle of 
ether into approximately two equal volumes and shake each in a large 
separatory funnel with 10-20 ml of the above iron(n) sulphate solution diluted 
with 100 ml of water. Remove the aqueous solution and combine the two ether 
portions in a clean dry Winchester bottle and add 1 00-200 g of anhydrous 
calcium chloride. Allow this mixture to stand for 24 hours with occasional 
shaking; the water and ethanol are largely removed during this period. Filter the 
ether through a large fluted filter paper into another clean dry Winchester 



* In this book, and in most others, the term ether implies reference to diethyl ether; other 
homologues are referred to by their systematic or trivial names. 

t Traces of aldehydes are produced. If ether of high purity is required, it should be further shaken 
with 0.5 per cent potassium permanganate solution (to convert the aldehyde into acid), then with 5 
per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and finally with water.

bottle. (CAUTION: All flames in the vicinity must be extinguished.) Fine sodium 
wire (about 7 g) is then introduced into the ether with the aid of a sodium press 
(Fig. 4.1). The latter consists of a rigid metal framework, which can be attached 
to the bench by means of a single bolt (as in the figure). An adjustable bottle 
stand is provided so that bottles up to a capacity of one Winchester quart can be 
used and their necks brought up to the underside of the mould. The plunger is of 
stainless steel as is also the one-piece mould and die. (A number of dies of 
various sizes, thus giving sodium wire of different diameters, are usually 
available for alternative use.) The die is nearly filled with lumps of clean sodium 
(Section 4.2.65, p. 462), then placed in position in the press, and the plunger 
slowly screwed down. As soon as the sodium wire emerges from the die, the 
Winchester bottle containing the ether is held immediately beneath the die, and 
the plunger is gradually lowered until all the sodium has been forced as a fine 
wire into the ether. The Winchester bottle is then closed by a rubber stopper 
carrying a calcium chloride guard-tube to exclude moisture and to permit the 
escape of hydrogen; the ether is allowed to stand for about 24 hours. The steel 
die must be removed from the press after use, any residual sodium destroyed by 
immersion in industrial spirit, and then thoroughly washed with water and 
finally dried, preferably in a heated oven; the plunger should also be swabbed 
with a rag or filter paper soaked in industrial spirit. If, on the following day, no 
bubbles of hydrogen rise from the sodium in the ether and the latter still 
possesses a bright surface, the Winchester bottle is closed by its own screw- 
capped stopper or by a rubber stopper, and preserved in the dark (to check the 
formation of peroxide as far as possible) in a cool place remote from flames. If, 
however, the surface of the sodium wire is badly attacked, due to insufficient 
drying with the calcium chloride, the ether must be filtered through a fluted filter 
paper into another clean, dry Winchester bottle and the treatment with sodium 
repeated.* The absolute diethyl ether thus prepared is suitable for use, for 
example, for Grignard reactions. If a fresh supply of high-grade ether of 
analytical reagent quality is available, the treatment with ferrous salt solution 
prior to the final sodium drying procedure may be omitted. 

An alternative method of drying, following the removal of peroxide, is to heat 
the ether under reflux under nitrogen with sodium benzophenone ketyl (use 10 g 
of benzophenone, 10 g of sodium and 1 litre of ether) until the dark blue or 

* The sodium residues in the bottle should be destroyed as recommended on p. 41.

purple colour persists. The pure ether can then be distilled immediately before 
use. 

16. DI-ISOPROPYL ETHER 

The commercial product usually contains appreciable quantities of peroxide; 
this should be removed by treatment with an acidified solution of an iron(n) 
salt or with a solution of sodium sulphite (see under 75. Diethyl ether). The di- 
isopropyl ether is then dried over anhydrous calcium chloride and distilled, the 
fraction b.p. 68.5°C/760mmHg being collected. Di-isopropyl ether should be 
stored in brown bottles away from the light. A small amount of hydroquinone 
(2 x 10~ 5 m) may be added as a peroxide inhibitor. 

17. DIBUTYL ETHER 

Technical dibutyl ether does not usually contain appreciable quantities of 
peroxide, unless it has been stored for a prolonged period. It should, however, be 
tested for peroxide, and, if the test is positive, the solvent should be shaken with 
an acidified solution of an iron(n) salt or with a solution of sodium sulphite (see 
under 75. Diethyl ether). The dibutyl ether is dried with anhydrous calcium 
chloride and distilled through a fractionating column; the portion b.p. 140- 
141 °C is collected. Alternatively, it may be distilled from calcium hydride or 
sodium metal. If a fraction of low boiling point is obtained, the presence of 
butan-1-ol is indicated and may be removed by shaking twice with an equal 
volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (see, however, Expt 5.70), followed by 
washing with water and drying. Pure dibutyl ether has b.p. 142°C/760mmHg. 

18. DI-ALKYL ETHERS OF MONOETHYLENE AND DIETHYLENE 
GLYCOL 

The dimethyl ether of ethylene glycol (dimethoxyethane, MeOCH 2 CH 2 OMe, 
frequently referred to as DME or dimethyl cellosolve or glyme) has b.p. 
85 °C/760mmHg, is miscible with water, is a good solvent and an excellent inert 
reaction medium. The diethyl ether of ethylene glycol (diethyl cellosolve) is 
partially miscible with water (21% at 20 °C) and has b.p. 121.5 °C/760mmHg. 

The dimethyl ether of diethylene glycol (Me-0-(CH 2 -CH 2 0-) 2 Me, diglyme) 
has b.p. 62°C/17mmHg; the corresponding diethyl ether {diethyl carbitol) has 
b.p. 186°C/760mmHg. 

All these are excellent solvents for organic compounds; they are purified by 
initial storage over sodium hydroxide pellets and then heated under reflux with 
calcium hydride, lithium aluminium hydride, sodium hydride, or sodium, before 
being fractionally distilled (under reduced pressure if necessary) in an atmo- 
sphere of nitrogen. 

19. TETRAHYDROFURAN (THF) 

The commercial grade of this solvent is obtainable in greater than 99.5 per cent 
purity, in which water and peroxides are the major impurities; an inhibitor for 
peroxide formation may have been added by the manufacturers. Peroxide, if 
present, must be removed by passage through a column of alumina (see 7. Light 
petroleum for footnote on the disposal of used alumina), or by shaking with 
iron(n) sulphate solution as described under diethyl ether before drying and 
further purification is attempted. If the latter method is employed the solvent 
should then be dried initially over calcium sulphate or solid potassium 

406 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.1 



hydroxide,* before being heated under reflux over calcium hydride or lithium 
aluminium hydride. The solvent is finally fractionally distilled. Pure tetrahydro- 
furan has b.p. 65-66 °C/760mmHg; it should be stored over calcium hydride 
under nitrogen, and labelled with the date of purification. It should not be stored 
for more than a few days unless an antioxidant such as 2,6-di-t-butyl-4- 
methylphenol (0.025%) is added. 

20. DIOXANE (1 ,4-Dioxane; diethylene dioxide) 

The commercial grade usually contains small quantities of acetaldehyde and 

O— i 



, together 



appreciable amounts of glycol acetal (ethylene acetal), Me- 

b— J 

with some water. Upon keeping, the acetal tends to undergo hydrolysis and the 
liberated acetaldehyde leads to some peroxide formation. Purification may be 
effected by decomposing the acetal with dilute acid, followed by drying and 
fractionation. One litre of technical dioxane, 14 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid and 100 ml of water are heated in a fume cupboard (dioxane vapour is 
highly toxic) under reflux for 6-12 hours while a slow stream of nitrogen is 
bubbled through the solution to remove the acetaldehyde formed. The cold 
solution is treated with excess potassium hydroxide pellets with shaking until 
some remain undissolved, and the strongly alkaline aqueous layer is run off; 
most of the residual water is removed by keeping the dioxane over fresh 
potassium hydroxide pellets for 24 hours. This treatment is followed by heating 
the decanted solvent under reflux over excess of sodium for 6-12 hours, i.e. until 
reaction ceases and the sodium remains bright. Finally, the dioxane is distilled 
from sodium preferably into a receiver encased in black paper; it should be 
stored out of contact with air and in the dark. The pure compound has b.p. 
101.5 °C/760mmHg and m.p. 12 °C. 

Distillation of the purified dioxane from calcium hydride or preferably 
passage through a column of basic activated alumina (1) before use, ensures the 
removal of any peroxide which may develop on storage. 

Dioxane is a very useful solvent for a variety of organic compounds; its 
solvating properties are similar to, and often better than, those of diethyl ether. 
It is miscible with water in all proportions and is extremely hygroscopic. 

Note. (1) An alternative to passage through alumina consists of heating the dioxane 
under reflux over sodium followed by the addition of benzophenone which gives a deep- 
blue purple solution of a disodium benzophenone complex when the dioxane becomes 
anhydrous. The solvent should be distilled from this mixture under nitrogen, the 
fractionating column and receiving flask being covered with black polythene film. 

KETONES 

21. ACETONE 

Although major impurities in the commercial grades of acetone are methanol, 
acetic acid and water, the analytical reagent generally contains less than 0. 1 per

4.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



cent of the organic impurities although the water content may be as high as 1 per 
cent. 
Commercial acetone may be purified in several ways: 

(a) The acetone is heated under reflux with successive quantities of potassium 
permanganate until the violet colour persists. It is then dried with 
anhydrous potassium carbonate or anhydrous calcium sulphate,* filtered 
from the desiccant and fractionated; precautions are taken to exclude 
moisture. 

(b) To 700 ml of acetone, b.p. 56-57 °C, contained in a litre bottle, a solution of 
3 g of silver nitrate in 20 ml of water is added, followed by 20 ml of 1 m 
sodium hydroxide solution, and the mixture is shaken for about 10 minutes. 
The mixture is then filtered, dried with anhydrous calcium sulphate and 
distilled. 

(c) When only a relatively small quantity of pure, dry acetone is required, it 
may be purified through the bisulphite complex: the latter is decomposed 
with sodium carbonate solution (for details, see under 22. Ethyl methyl 
ketone), dried over anhydrous calcium sulphate and distilled. A more 
convenient procedure is to make use of the addition compound with sodium 
iodide (NaI,3C 3 H 6 0), which decomposes on gentle heating and is parti- 
cularly well adapted for the preparation of pure acetone. One hundred 
grams of finely powdered sodium iodide are dissolved under reflux in 440 g 
of boiling commercial acetone, and the solution is cooled in a mixture of ice 
and salt ( — 8 °C). The crystals are filtered off and quickly transferred to a 
dry distilling flask, connected to an efficient condenser and to a receiver 
cooled in ice. Upon gentle warming, the acetone distils rapidly. 

Acetone purified by these means, or the analytical reagent grade, may have 
the water content reduced by storage over a Type 4A molecular sieve. Silica gel 
or alumina should not be used as an aldol type reaction is initiated with the 
formation of water as a by-product. Pure acetone has b.p. 56.2°C/760mmHg 
and is highly flammable. 

22. ETHYL METHYL KETONE (Butan-2-one) 

This excellent solvent has properties similar to those of acetone but it has a 
somewhat higher boiling point and is therefore less flammable. A preliminary 
purification is effected by drying the commercial product with anhydrous 
potassium carbonate or anhydrous calcium sulphate, filtering from the desic- 
cant, and fractionating through an efficient column; the fraction, b.p. 79-80 °C, is 
collected separately, and is quite satisfactory for recrystallisations. This may be 
further purified either through the bisulphite addition compound or through the 
sodium iodide addition compound. The ethyl methyl ketone, b.p. 79-80 °C, is 
shaken with excess of saturated sodium bisulphite solution until reaction ceases, 
cooled to °C, the bisulphite complex filtered off, the filter cake well drained, 
washed with a little ether, and then dried in the air. The dry bisulphite complex 
is decomposed with a slight excess of sodium carbonate solution, and distilled in 
steam. The ketone is salted out from the distillate with potassium carbonate, 
separated, dried with anhydrous potassium carbonate (this will also remove 
traces of sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide present) and, after filtration, 

* Anhydrous calcium chloride should not be used as some chemical combination occurs.

SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.1 



allowed to stand for several hours over anhydrous calcium sulphate. It is then 
distilled. In the sodium iodide method, the ketone is saturated with sodium 
iodide by boiling under reflux, the solution is filtered through a hot -water funnel, 
cooled in a freezing mixture and white crystals (which have a m.p. of 73-74 °C) 
filtered off. Gentle heating of the crystals in a fractional distillation assembly 
gives pure ethyl methyl ketone of b.p. 79.5 °C/760mmHg. 

ESTERS 

23. METHYL ACETATE 

An anhydrous product of 99 per cent purity (b.p. 56.5-57 °C) is available 
commercially; this is comparatively cheap so that purification of inferior 
products is not worth while. It is appreciably soluble in water (c. 24% at 20 °C). 
The pure compound has b.p. 57°C/760mmHg. 

If it is desired to purify an inferior product, 1 litre is heated under reflux for 6 
hours with 85 ml of acetic anhydride and then distilled through a fractionating 
column: the liquid passing over at 56-57 °C is collected. The distillate is shaken 
with 20 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate for 10 minutes, filtered and 
redistilled. The resulting methyl acetate has a purity of 99.9 per cent. 

24. ETHYL ACETATE 

Various grades of ethyl acetate are marketed. The anhydrous compound, b.p. 
76-77 °C, is of 99 per cent purity, is inexpensive and is suitable for most 
purposes. The 95-98 per cent grade usually contains some water, ethanol and 
acetic acid, and may be purified in the following manner. A mixture of ! litre of 
the commercial ethyl acetate, 100 ml of acetic anhydride and 10 drops of 
concentrated sulphuric acid is heated under reflux for 4 hours and then 
fractionated. The distillate is shaken with 20-30 g of anhydrous potassium 
carbonate, filtered and redistilled from calcium hydride. The final product has a 
purity of about 99.7 per cent and boils at 77°C/760mmHg. 

NITROGEN-CONTAINING SOLVENTS 

25. FORMAMIDE 

Formamide is an excellent solvent for many polar organic compounds and for a 
selection of inorganic salts. It is very hygroscopic and readily hydrolysed by 
acids or bases. The commercial product frequently contains formic acid, water 
and ammonium formate. Purification may be effected by passing ammonia gas 
into the solvent until a slight alkaline reaction is obtained; addition of dry 
acetone then precipitates the ammonium formate. The filtered solution is dried 
over magnesium sulphate and fractionally distilled under reduced pressure; 
distillation at atmospheric pressure causes decomposition. Pure formamide has 
b.p. 105°C/llmmHg. 

26. JVA-DIMETHYLFORMAMIDE (DMF) 

JV,JV-Dimethylformamide is a widely used solvent for many recently developed 
synthetic procedures because of its powerful solvating properties and its 
chemical stability in the absence of acidic or basic catalysts. However, 
distillation at atmospheric pressure (b.p. 149-1 56 °C) or contact with desiccants 
such as solid sodium or potassium hydroxide or calcium hydride causes varying 
degrees of decomposition. 

409 



4.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Commercial grades of DMF may be purified initially by azeotropic 
distillation with benzene (CAUTION). Distil a mixture of 1 litre of DMF and 
100 ml of benzene at atmospheric pressure and collect the water : benzene 
azeotrope which distils between 70 and 75 °C. Shake the residual solvent with 
powdered barium oxide or with activated alumina (Grade I), filter and distil 
under nitrogen at reduced pressure; collect the fraction having b.p. 
76°C/39mmHg or 40°C/10mmHg. The distillate is best stored over a Type 4A 
molecular sieve. 

An alternative method of purification which avoids the hazards associated 
with the use of benzene is to dry the DMF over calcium sulphate or Type 3A 
molecular sieve for 72 hours, followed by distillation under reduced pressure. 
The solvent thus obtained is suitable for most purposes. If azeotropic distillation 
is required toluene may be substituted for benzene. 

27. ACETONITRILE 

This is another highly versatile solvent for many synthetic procedures. Although 
some commercial grades may be available having purities equal to or greater 
than 99.5 per cent, the usual contaminants in lower purity grades are water, 
acetamide, ammonium acetate and ammonia. Water may be removed with 
activated silica gel or Type 4A molecular sieves (not solid potassium hydroxide 
since this causes decomposition; calcium sulphate and calcium chloride are 
inefficient in this instance). This partially dried solvent is stirred with calcium 
hydride (1) which is added portionwise until hydrogen evolution ceases. The 
solvent is decanted from the solid and fractionally distilled at atmospheric 
pressure using a high efficiency column {Fig. 2.106); the pure solvent has b.p. 81- 
82°C/760mmHg. 

Note. (1) Phosphorus pentoxide has been reported to be a more effective desiccant than 
calcium hydride. 

28. JV-METHYLPYRROLIDONE 

This versatile solvent has good chemical stability in the absence of acids and 
bases which catalyse the cleavage of the lactam ring. It is most conveniently 
dried by initial azeotropic distillation with previously dried benzene or toluene 
as descriBed for DMF, and the residual liquid is shaken with barium oxide, the 
desiccant is removed and the solvent is fractionally distilled under reduced 
pressure (c. 20 mm). The pure solvent has b.p. 94-96 °C/20 mmHg, or 
202°C/760mmHg. 

29. PYRIDINE* 

The analytical reagent grade (&gt;99.5% purity) will satisfy most requirements. If 
required perfectly dry, it should be heated under reflux over calcium hydride, 
potassium hydroxide or sodium hydroxide pellets or over barium oxide, and 
then distilled with careful exclusion of moisture. It is hygroscopic and forms a 
hydrate of b.p. 94.5 °C. Pure pyridine has b.p. 115.3 °C/760mmHg. It should be 
stored over calcium hydride, barium oxide or Type 4A molecular sieve. 

Pure pyridine may be prepared from technical coal-tar pyridine in the 
following manner. The technical pyridine is first dried over solid sodium 

* Pyridine should be handled with extreme CAUTION. It should be dispensed in an efficient fume 
cupboard and disposable gloves should be worn.

SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.1 



hydroxide, distilled through an efficient fractionating column, and the fraction, 
b.p. 1 14-1 16 °C, collected. Four hundred ml of the redistilled pyridine are added 
to a reagent prepared by dissolving 340 g of anhydrous zinc chloride in a 
mixture of 210 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 litre of absolute 
ethanol. A crystalline precipitate of an addition compound (probable com- 
position 2C 5 H 5 N,ZnCl 2 ,HCl*) separates and some heat is evolved. When cold, 
this is collected by suction filtration, and washed with a little absolute ethanol. 
The yield is about 680 g. It is recrystallised from absolute ethanol to constant 
m.p. (151.8 °C). The base is liberated by the addition of excess of concentrated 
sodium hydroxide solution (c. 40%) to the complex followed by steam 
distillation until the distillate is no longer alkaline to litmus (c. 1000 ml). The 
steam distillate is treated with 250 g of solid sodium hydroxide, the upper layer 
separated and the aqueous layer extracted with two 250 ml portions of ether. 
The combined upper layer and ether extracts are dried with anhydrous 
potassium carbonate, the ether removed on a water bath and the pyridine 
distilled through a fractionating column. Further drying is effected as described 
for the analytical grade reagent. The pure pyridine has b.p. 1 15.3 °C/760mmHg. 

30. QUINOLINE 

Quinoline is little used as a solvent. It may be dried if required with potassium 
hydroxide pellets and fractionally distilled under reduced pressure; b.p. 
114°C/17mmHg. 

31. NITROBENZENE 

Nitrobenzene of analytical reagent quality is satisfactory for most purposes. The 
technical product may contain dinitrobenzene, the nitrotoluenes and aniline. 
Most of the impurities are retained in the residue after addition of dilute 
sulphuric acid and steam distillation: the nitrobenzene in the distillate is 
separated, dried with calcium chloride and distilled under reduced pressure. The 
pure solvent has b.p. 210°C/760mmHg and m.p. 5.7 °C. 

Nitrobenzene is an extremely versatile solvent, and may sometimes be 
employed for the crystallisation of compounds which do not dissolve appreci- 
ably in the common organic solvents. The vapour is very toxic, so that 
recrystallisations must be carried out in the fume cupboard. After the crystals 
have been collected, they should be washed with a volatile solvent, such as 
ethanol or ether, to remove the excess of nitrobenzene (compare Section 2.20). A 
disadvantage of nitrobenzene as a solvent is its pronounced oxidising action at 
the boiling point.

2C 5 H 5 N,ZnCl 2 ,HCl. The former is slightly soluble in water and in hot ethanol: the latter passes into 
the former in aqueous solution, is readily soluble in hot ethanol and can therefore be readily 
recrystallised from this solvent.

4.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



appreciable quantities of carbon disulphide should be carried out in a water 
bath at 55-65 °C; it has been known to ignite as the result of being overheated on 
a steam bath. 

The analytical reagent grade is suitable for most purposes. The commercial 
substance may be purified by shaking for 3 hours with three portions of 
potassium permanganate solution (5 g per litre), twice for 6 hours with mercury 
and finally with a solution of mercury(n) sulphate (2.5 g per litre). It is then dried 
over anhydrous calcium chloride, and fractionated from a water bath at 55- 
65 °C. The pure compound boils at 46.5 °C/760mmHg. 

33. DIMETHYL SULPHOXIDE (DMSO)* 

Dimethyl sulphoxide has recently come to be recognised as a highly useful 
water-miscible solvent for many preparative procedures and for spectroscopic 
work; a study of its chemistry has revealed its potential as an important 
synthetic reagent. It is hygroscopic and distillation at atmospheric pressures 
causes some decomposition. The commercial grade may be dried by standing 
overnight over freshly activated alumina, calcium hydride, barium oxide or 
calcium sulphate. The filtered solvent is then fractionally distilled over calcium 
hydride under reduced pressure (c. 12mmHg) and stored over a Type 4A 
molecular sieve. An additional stage involving cooling the solvent to about 5 °C, 
filtering the partially crystallised mass and fractionally distilling the melted 
crystals has been recommended. The pure solvent has b.p. 75-76°C/12mmHg, 
m.p. 18-19 °C. 

34. SULPHOLANE (Tetrahydrothiophene- 1,1 -dioxide) 

This is a further useful water-miscible aprotic solvent of moderately high 
dielectric constant but with weak acidic and basic characteristics. Although not 
soluble in saturated hydrocarbon solvents it is a good solvent for most other 
classes of organic compounds. Purification is effected by passage through a 
column of activated alumina and distillation under reduced pressure or by 
repeated vacuum distillation from sodium hydroxide pellets. The pure com- 
pound has b.p. 113-117 °C/6 mmHg and m.p. 27 °C; some decomposition occurs 
at the boiling point (287 °C) at atmospheric pressure. The solvent may be stored 
over a Type 4A molecular sieve. 

PHOSPHORUS-CONTAINING SOLVENTS 

35. HEXAMETHYLPHOSPHORIC TRIAMIDE (HMPT) 

HMPT is now thought to be a potent carcinogen. It should be handled with 
extreme care; inhalation of the vapour and contact with the skin should be avoided. 
This solvent is miscible both with water and with many polar and non-polar 
organic solvents with the exception of saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons. It 
forms a complex with chlorinated solvents by which means it may be removed 
from aqueous solutions. The solvent may be dried by shaking with calcium 
hydride or barium oxide followed by distillation under reduced pressure and

allowed to come into contact with periodic acid, magnesium perchlorate or perchloric acid. A 
mixture of sodium hydride (4.5 mol) and dimethyl sulphoxide (18.4mol) may also explode after 
about 1 hour.

An account is given in this section of a selection of inorganic and organic 
reagents, many of which are required for the preparations described later. The 
preparation of those reagents which can be purchased at reasonable cost will not 
normally be described, but in those cases where the purified reagents are 
somewhat expensive, the methods of purification of the technical products will 
be outlined. Some comments on precautions for handling hazardous reagents 
are also included, but the relevant passages in Section 2.3 should be also noted. 
When a reagent is used for the first time, the potential hazards associated with 
the reagent should be carefully checked with appropriate sources (e.g. manu- 
facturers' catalogues, i.e. BDH, Aldrich, etc.). Particular attention is drawn to 
those gaseous reagents which are available commercially in cylinders; the 
comments in Section 2.3.2, p. 38 regarding the hazards of storage and handling 
of gas cylinders and of the precautions to be taken in their use should be noted. 

1. ALKYL NITRITES 

These are readily prepared by the interaction at °C of the alcohol with sodium 
nitrite in the presence of excess of concentrated sulphuric acid. 

ROH + HN0 2 " 2S ° 4 &gt; R-ONO + H 2 

Alkyl nitrites are valuable nitrosating agents (e.g. Expt 5.100); isopentyl nitrite is 
the common commercially available example, but several illustrative prepar- 
ations are given below. For pentyl nitrite, equip a 1 -litre three-necked flask with 
a powerful mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel with stem extending to the 
bottom of the flask and a thermometer. Cool the flask in a mixture of ice and 
salt. Place a solution of 95 g (1.38 mol) of 'AnalaR' sodium nitrite in 375 ml of 
water in the flask and stir. When the temperature has fallen to °C (or slightly 
below) introduce slowly from the separatory funnel a mixture of 25 ml of water, 
62.5g (34ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid and llOg (135ml, 1.25 mol) of 
pentan-1-ol, which has previously been cooled to °C. The rate of addition must 
be controlled so that the temperature is maintained at + 1 °C; the addition takes 
45-60 minutes. Allow the mixture to stand for 1.5 hours and then filter from the 
precipitated sodium sulphate (1). Separate the upper yellow pentyl nitrite layer, 
wash it with a solution containing 1 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate and 12.5 g 
of sodium chloride in 50 ml of water, and dry it with 5-7 g of magnesium 
sulphate. The resulting crude pentyl nitrite (107g, 73%) is satisfactory for many 
purposes (2). Upon distillation, it passes over largely at 104 °C with negligible 
decomposition. The b.p. under reduced pressure is 29°C/40mmHg. 

Notes. (1) Care must be exercised in handling pentyl and the other alkyl nitrites; 
inhalation of the vapour may cause severe headache and heart excitation. The 
preparation must therefore be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 
(2) Alkyl nitrites decompose slowly upon standing and should be kept in a cool place. 
They should preferably be used within a few days or, at most, within two weeks of their 
preparation. The decomposition products include water, oxides of nitrogen, the alcohol 
and polymerisation products of the aldehyde.

4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Hexyl nitrite may be prepared similarly by using 95 g (1.38 mol) of 'AnalaR' 
sodium nitrite in 375 ml of water; a mixture of 25 ml of water, 62.5 g (34 ml) of 
concentrated sulphuric acid and 127.5g (156ml, 1.25 mol) of hexan-1-ol. The 
yield of crude product is 124g (76%). B.p. 129-130.5 °C or 52°C/44mmHg. 

For butyl nitrite use the same quantities as for hexyl nitrite, but with 92.5 g 
(114 ml, 1.25 mol) of butan-1-ol replacing the hexan-1-ol. The yield of crude 
product is llOg (85%). Butyl nitrite boils at 76.5-77.5 °C at atmospheric 
pressure with slight decomposition, but distils unchanged at 27 °C/43 mmHg. 

Ethyl nitrite may be prepared by dissolving 38 g (0.55 mol) of sodium nitrite 
in 120 ml of water in a 500-ml flask equipped as above. Dilute 23 g (29 ml, 
0.5 mol) of ethanol with an equal volume of water, carefully add 25 g (13.5 ml) of 
concentrated sulphuric acid and dilute to 120 ml with water. Cool both solutions 
to — 10 °C in an ice-salt bath and add the acid-alcohol mixture to the nitrite 
solution slowly with constant stirring during about 30 minutes. Transfer the 
reaction mixture to a cooled separating funnel, run off the lower aqueous phase, 
wash the ethyl nitrite layer rapidly with ice-cold 2 per cent sodium hydrogen 
carbonate solution and dry over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The product may 
be kept at °C as a 50 per cent solution in absolute ethanol if required but 
should be used as soon as possible. The b.p. of pure ethyl nitrite is 17 °C. 

2. ALUMINIUM ALKOXIDES 

Aluminium t-butoxide is prepared as follows. In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask 
fitted with a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride guard-tube, place 
16 g (0.59 mol) of aluminium foil, 50 g (63.5 ml, 0.67 mol) of anhydrous t-butyl 
alcohol (2-methylpropan-2-ol) and 2 g aluminium isopropoxide (see below) to 
remove traces of water. Heat the mixture (electric mantle) to boiling, add about 
0.1 g of mercury(n) chloride and shake vigorously: the object of the shaking is to 
distribute the mercury(n) chloride and thus assist an even amalgamation of the 
aluminium. Continue heating; the colour of the reaction mixture gradually 
changes from clear to milky to black and hydrogen is evolved. When the mixture 
is black, allow the reaction to proceed for an hour without further heating, and 
then add 61 g (77 ml, 0.82 mol) of anhydrous t-butyl alcohol and 50 ml of 
anhydrous benzene (CAUTION). Heat gently to restart the reaction; it will 
continue vigorously without further heating for about 2 hours: when the 
reaction subsides heat the mixture under reflux for 12 hours. Remove the 
benzene and unreacted t-butyl alcohol by distillation under reduced pressure 
(water pump) using a rotary evaporator, taking care to remove the final traces of 
solvent as far as possible. Add 250 ml of anhydrous ether; dissolve the solid 
aluminium t-butoxide by heating under reflux for a short time. After cooling, 
add 9 ml of undried ether and immediately shake vigorously; the small amount 
of water thus introduced forms aluminium hydroxide, which assists the 
precipitation of the black suspended material. Allow to stand for 2 hours, 
centrifuge the mixture for 30 minutes to remove aluminium hydroxide, unused 
aluminium and mercury. After centrifugation the solution should be colourless 
or almost so; if it is still dark in colour, add a further 6 ml of undried ether and 
centrifuge again. Now remove the solvent under reduced pressure (water pump) 
using a rotary evaporator. Allow the flask to cool with drying tube attached, 
crush the product with a spatula and transfer it to a small bottle: seal the latter 
against moisture. The yield of white or pale grey aluminium t-butoxide is 105g 
(72%).

SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



Aluminium isopropoxide is prepared as follows. Place 27 g (1 mol) of clean 
aluminium foil in a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask containing 235 g (300 ml, 
3.91 mol) of dried isopropyl alcohol (Propan-2-ol, Section 4.1.77, p. 402) and 
0.5 g of mercury(n) chloride. Attach an efficient double surface reflux condenser 
carrying a calcium chloride guard-tube. Heat the mixture on a water bath or 
heating mantle to reflux. Then add 2 ml of carbon tetrachloride (CAUTION) 
(a catalyst for the reaction between aluminium and dry alcohols) through the 
condenser, and continue the heating. The mixture turns grey and, within a few 
minutes, a vigorous evolution of hydrogen commences. Discontinue the heating: 
it may be necessary to moderate the reaction by cooling the flask in ice-water or 
in running tap water. After the reaction has moderated heat the mixture under 
reflux until all the metal has reacted (6-12 hours). The mixture becomes dark 
because of the presence of suspended particles.* Pour the hot solution into a 
500-ml flask fitted with a still-head, a condenser and a 250-ml receiving flask. 
Add a few fragments of porous porcelain and heat the flask in an oil bath at 
90 °C under slightly diminished pressure (water pump). When nearly all the 
isopropyl alcohol has distilled, raise the temperature of the bath to 170 °C and 
lower the pressure gradually to the full vacuum of the water pump. Immediately 
the temperature of the distillate rises above 90 °C, stop the distillation and 
remove the condenser. Attach a 500-ml receiving flask with adapter directly to 
the still-head, add a few fresh boiling chips and distil; use either an oil bath, at 
180-190 °C, or an air bath. The aluminium isopropoxide passes over, as a 
colourless viscid liquid, at 140-150°C/12mmHg; the yield is 190 g (90%). Pour 
the molten aluminium isopropoxide into a wide-mouthed, glass-stoppered 
bottle and seal the bottle with paraffin wax (or with sealing tape) to exclude 
moisture. Generally the alkoxide (m.p. 1 18 °C) crystallises out, but the substance 
exhibits a great tendency to supercool and it may be necessary to cool to °C for 
1-2 days before solidification occurs. 

The reagent is conveniently stored as a solution in isopropyl alcohol. The 
molten (or solid) alkoxide is weighed out after distillation into a glass-stoppered 
bottle or flask and is dissolved in sufficient dry isopropyl alcohol to give a 1 m 
solution. This solution may be kept without appreciable deterioration provided 
the glass stopper is sealed with paraffin wax or sealing tape. Crystals of 
aluminium isopropoxide separate on standing, but these may be redissolved by 
warming the mixture to 65-70 °C. 

For many reductions it is not necessary to distil the reagent. Dilute the dark 
solution, prepared as above to the point marked with an asterisk, to 1 litre with 
dry isopropyl alcohol; this gives an approximately 1 m solution. Alternatively, 
prepare the quantity necessary for the reduction, using the appropriate 
proportions of the reagents. 

3. ALUMINIUM AMALGAM 

Place 100 g of thin aluminium foil (c. 0.05 mm thickness), cut into strips about 
1 5 cm long and 2.5 cm wide and loosely folded, in a 3-litre flask and cover with a 
10 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide; warm the flask on a water bath until a 
vigorous evolution of hydrogen has taken place for several minutes 
(CAUTION). Wash the foil thoroughly with water and with rectified spirit; this 

* This crude solution may be used directly for some preparations (see later). In general the presence 
of these particles has no influence on reactions using aluminium isopropoxide.

4i PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



operation produces an exceptionally clean surface for amalgamation. Add 
sufficient of a 2 per cent solution of mercury(ii) chloride to cover the aluminium 
completely and allow to react for about 2 minutes; pour off the supernatant 
solution and wash the amalgam with water, rectified spirit and finally with moist 
ether. Cover the amalgam with about 1.5 litres of moist ether, when it is then 
ready for immediate use. If another solvent, e.g. methyl or ethyl acetate, is to be 
employed in the reduction with moist aluminium amalgam, the ether may of 
course be replaced by this solvent. 

4. ALUMINIUM CHLORIDE (ANHYDROUS) 

This reagent may be purchased in the form of small pellets which are easily and 
quickly crushed in a mortar immediately before addition to the reaction flask 
(as for example in a Friedel-Crafts reaction, Expt 6.5), and covered with solvent. 
In these cases the small amount of hydrolysis which occurs during the grinding 
operation is not unduly harmful to the reaction yield. This pelleted material does 
unfortunately deteriorate fairly rapidly on reaction with atmospheric moisture 
on continued opening and closing of the reagent bottle. The material should 
therefore be carefully inspected before use and if a large amount of powdery 
white material is present a fresh bottle should be used. 

However, in some reactions a very high grade of anhydrous aluminium 
chloride may be required. This is conveniently prepared by placing the crushed 
pellets in a suitably sized round-bottomed flask fitted with a simple distillation 
bend to which is attached a two-necked round-bottomed receiver flask; the 
second outlet is connected to a water pump via a drying tower similar to that 
shown in Fig. 4.2 and filled with granular calcium chloride. The distillation flask 
is heated cautiously with a brush flame and the aluminium chloride sublimes 
under reduced pressure. It is inadvisable to use an oil immersion rotary pump 
because of possible corrosion damage even with suitably placed protection 
traps.

5. AMMONIA 

Gaseous ammonia is conveniently obtained from a cylinder of the liquefied gas; 
the cylinder must be equipped with a reducing valve. The rate of flow of the gas 
may be determined by passage through a bubble counter containing a small 
quantity of concentrated potassium hydroxide solution (12 g of KOH in 12 ml of 
water). A safety bottle should be inserted between the cylinder and the bubble 
counter and the reaction vessel; the gas may be dried by passage through a 
column loosely packed with soda lime or calcium oxide lumps (cf. Fig. 4.2). For 
reactions which require the use of liquid ammonia see Section 2.17.7, p. 116. 

Small quantities of ammonia may if necessary be prepared with the aid of the 
apparatus depicted in Fig. 4.2. Concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.88) is gently 
heated in the flask surmounted by an efficient reflux condenser. The gas is 
further dried by passage through a column which is loosely packed with soda 
lime or calcium oxide lumps,* and is then passed through a Drechsel bottle to 
act as a safety trap. 

6. BENZOYL PEROXIDE 

The commercial product is cheap and is usually supplied moistened with 
approximately 25 per cent of water. Small quantities may be prepared in the 
laboratory from benzoyl chloride and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of 
alkali. 

e nH 
2Ph-COCl + H 2 2 -^ Ph-CO-O-O-CO-Ph + 2HC1 

Immerse a 600-ml beaker containing 50 ml (0.175mol) of 12 per cent (40 
volume) hydrogen peroxide and equipped with a mechanical stirrer, in an ice 
bath sited in a fume cupboard. Support two dropping funnels, containing 
respectively 30 ml of 4 m sodium hydroxide solution and 30 g (25 ml, 0.214mol) 
of redistilled benzoyl chloride (lachrymatory), with their stems inside the beaker. 
Add the two reagents alternately a few drops at a time, taking care that the 
temperature does not rise above 5-8 °C and that the solution is maintained 
faintly alkaline throughout. When all the reagents have been added, stir the 
solution for a further half an hour; by this time the odour of the benzoyl chloride 
should have disappeared. Filter off the flocculent precipitate at the pump, wash 
it with a little cold water and air dry upon filter paper. The yield of benzoyl 
peroxide is 12 g (46%). It may be purified by dissolving in chloroform at room 
temperature and adding twice the volume of methanol. Benzoyl peroxide should 
not be recrystallised from hot chloroform, as a serious explosion may result. The 
compound melts at 106 °C with decomposition. Like all organic peroxides, 
benzoyl peroxide should be handled with care behind shatter-proof screens, and 
horn or moulded polyethylene (not nickel) spatulas should be used. It is very 
shock sensitive. 

To determine the exact peroxide content of benzoyl peroxide (and of other 
organic peroxides), the following procedure may be employed. Dissolve about 
0.5 g, accurately weighed, of benzoyl peroxide in 1 5 ml of chloroform in a 350-ml 
conical flask. Cool to — 5°C, and add 25 ml of a 0.1m solution of sodium 
methoxide in methanol in one portion with cooling and shaking. After 5 minutes 
at — 5 °C, add 100 ml of iced water, 5 ml of 10 per cent sulphuric acid and 2 g of

potassium iodide in 20 ml of 10 per cent sulphuric acid, in the order mentioned, 
with vigorous stirring. Titrate the liberated iodine with standard 0.10 m sodium 
thiosulphate solution: 

1 ml of 0.10 m Na 2 S 2 3 = 0.0121 g of benzoyl peroxide 

7. BORANES 

The complexes and derivatives of borane (BH 3 ) are now among the most useful 
and versatile reagents available to the organic chemist. The reader is referred to 
key monographs and reviews for a full account of the variety and scope of these 
reagents. 4 A very wide range of boranes is now available commercially, but it is 
often convenient and less expensive to prepare them as and when needed. Most 
reactions with boranes should be carried out under an inert atmosphere. Section 
2.17.8, p. 120 should be consulted for details of the experimental procedures for 
these reactions. 

Borane can be prepared in situ as described in Expts 5.44 and 5.89. 
Alternatively, a separate solution of borane in tetrahydrofuran can be prepared 
by adding a solution of sodium borohydride to boron trifluoride-etherate and 
sweeping the resulting borane into tetrahydrofuran with the aid of a nitrogen 
gas stream. 

3NaBH 4 + 4BF 3 &gt; 4BH 3 + 3NaBF 4 

Fit the central neck of a 500-ml round-bottomed two-necked flask (the 
generating flask), supported on a magnetic stirrer unit, with a pressure- 
equalising dropping funnel connected to a nitrogen supply via a suitable 
mercury safety valve (cf. Fig. 2.66). Connect with Tygon or polyethylene tubing 
the side-neck of the generating flask to a Drechsel wash bottle, the outlet of 
which leads into a 500-ml two necked round-bottomed flask via a gas inlet tube 
terminating in a glass frit (cf. Fig. 2.59). Charge this flask with 400 ml of dry 
tetrahydrofuran (Section 4.1.79, p. 406) and close the second neck with a calcium 
chloride guard-tube. Dissolve 13.3 g (0.35 mol) of sodium borohydride (Section 
4.2.49, p. 447) in 350ml of dry diglyme (Section 4.1.75, p. 406) and place 300 ml 
(0.3 mol) of this solution in the dropping funnel. Use the remainder of the 
solution to adequately charge the Drechsel wash bottle so that the borane 
subsequently generated is scrubbed free of boron trifluoride. Place 85 g (0.6 mol) 
of redistilled boron trifluoride etherate (Section 4.2.5, p. 421) in the generating 
flask, insert a follower bar and allow nitrogen to pass through the assembly for a 
period of about 1 5 minutes to displace all the air. Generate the borane by adding 
the sodium borohydride solution steadily to the stirred boron trifluoride- 
etherate. When all the solution has been added continue to pass the nitrogen gas 
for a further period of 15 minutes to ensure that all the borane has been swept 
into the tetrahydrofuran solution. This will also ensure that little borane gas will 
escape to the atmosphere when the apparatus is disconnected; borane is highly 
toxic and may contain impurities which can lead to spontaneous ignition. 

The final tetrahydrofuran solution prepared in this way is approximately 1 m 
with respect to borane; the solution is reasonably stable if stored between and 
5°C. 

An alternative technique (which uses essentially the same apparatus assembly 
as described above) involves passage of borane directly into a solution of the 
organic substrate in tetrahydrofuran, diglyme or ether to effect immediate 

418 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



reaction. This requires the additional facility of magnetic stirring and of cooling 
the reaction mixture. 

Borane-methyl sulphide (BH 3 -SMe 2 ) is a complex of borane which is 
available commercially and should be handled in a fume cupboard. It is a 
flammable, moisture-sensitive liquid and is supplied in sealed containers under 
nitrogen. It offers a number of advantages over the tetrahydrofuran complex. 5 
The concentration of borane in solution is about ten times that in tetrahydro- 
furan. The solution is more stable than the tetrahydrofuran complex and can be 
stored for several months under nitrogen at room temperature without 
decomposition. The solution is soluble in and does not react with a range of 
aprotic solvents such as ether, hexane, toluene and dichloromethane thus 
widening the range of available solvents for hydroboration reactions. Experi- 
mental work is easy since the by-products formed by hydrolysis on addition of 
water are easily removed. Methyl sulphide which is distilled off from the reaction 
mixture should be destroyed by pouring the distillate slowly into a large excess 
of 5 per cent sodium hypochlorite. The resulting solution may be safely poured 
down the drain after about 30 minutes. Examples of the use of borane-methyl 
sulphide complex in synthesis are described in Expts 5.34 and 5.66. 

Borane is also available commercially as a complex with ammonia and with a 
wide range of organic bases. 

The majority of mono- and di-substituted alkenes undergo hydroboration to 
give trialkylboranes which are then available for a variety of synthetic 
procedures. With some alkenes, alkylation of borane does not go to completion 
and the resulting mono- or di-alkyl boranes are useful in synthesis as modified 
boranes. Thus, 2-methylbut-2-ene gives bis(3-methyl-2-butyl)borane 
(disiamylborane). 

2Me 2 C=CH-Me + BH 3 &gt; [Me 2 CHCHMe] 2 BH 

This borane reagent may be prepared as follows. 6 In a dry 500-ml flask equipped 
with a condenser, a thermometer and a pressure-equalising dropping funnel are 
placed 80 ml of diglyme, 23.1 g of 2-methylbut-2-ene (0.33 mol) in 20 ml of 
diglyme and 4.7 g of sodium borohydride (0.125 mol). The flask is immersed in 
an ice bath and 23.5 g of boron trifluoride-etherate (0.1 65 mol) is added 
dropwise over a period of 30 minutes. The semi-solid reaction mixture 
containing 0.165 mol of disiamylborane is permitted to remain an additional 15 
hours at 0-5 °C, and then used for hydroboration. Examples of the use of 
disiamylborane are described in Sections 5.4.3 p. 542 and 5.7.1, p. 588. 

Addition of borane to 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene gives 2,3-dimethyl-2-butylborane 
(thexylborane) which is also a synthetically useful substituted borane. 

Me 2 C=CMe 2 + BH 3 » Me 2 CH-C(Me) 2 BH 2 

It can be prepared as a solution in either (a) tetrahydrofuran or (b) diglyme, as 
follows. 7 

(a) In a 100-ml three-necked flask fitted with a thermometer, a pressure- 
equalising dropping funnel, a condenser and a side-arm capped with a rubber 
septum to permit removal of samples is placed 4.2 g (50mmol) of 2,3- 
dimethylbut-2-ene in 33 ml of tetrahydrofuran. The flask is cooled to — 10 °C, 
then 27.5 ml of a 0.91 m solution of borane in tetrahydrofuran is added slowly to 
the olefin. After completion of the borane addition, the flask is maintained at 
20-25 °C. 

419 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(b) In a 100-ml flask (as above) are placed 18 ml of diglyme, 9.4 ml of a 1 m 
solution of sodium borohydride in diglyme and 8.3 ml of a 1.5 m solution of 2,3- 
dimethylbut-2-ene (12.5 mol) in diglyme. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, 
then 7.0 ml of a 1 .83 m solution of boron trifluoride-diglymate is added to the 
well-stirred reaction mixture over 15 minutes. The reaction is allowed to 
proceed for an additional hour at 0-3 °C. An example of the use of thexylborane 
in synthesis is described in Section 5.4.3, p. 452. Kits for the preparation of up to 
0.1 mol of disiamylborane and thexylborane are available commercially from 
the Aldrich Chemical Company. They consist of sealed containers of solutions 
of borane-tetrahydrofuran complex and a solution of the appropriate alkene. 

Reaction of borane with the cyclic diene, cycloocta-l,5-diene, is used to 
prepare the synthetically useful borane 9-borab\cy\6[3 3 .l~\nonane (9-BBN) 




+ BH, 




It may be prepared as follows. 8 A 1 -litre flask with an injection port is equipped 
with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. To the top of the condenser 
is fitted a pressure-equalising dropping funnel which is connected to a source of 
nitrogen. The flask is cooled to — 5 °C in an ice-salt bath and charged with 
505 ml of 1.98 m borane in tetrahydrofuran (1 mol). The dropping funnel is 
charged with 108 g of cycloocta-l,5-diene (1 mol) (distilled from lithium 
aluminium hydride before use, b.p. 45-48°C/19mmHg) which is added 
dropwise over 1 hour to the stirred borane solution. The cooling bath is 
removed and the mixture heated under reflux for 1 hour. The resulting clear 
solution is cooled slowly, without stirring, to room temperature. Cooling in an 
ice-water bath completes precipitation of the product. The supernatant liquid is 
decanted using a double-ended 15-gauge needle (Section 2.17.8, p. 124). The 
solid is washed twice with 50 ml portions of ice-cold pentane, decanting the 
supernatant liquid as before. After drying at 50 °C in vacuo, the yield of fine 
white powder is approximately 75 per cent (85-95 g), m.p. 152-155 °C (in a 
sealed, evacuated capillary). The thermal stability of 9-BBN is remarkable. 
Samples can be heated under nitrogen to 200 °C for 24 hours with only minor 
loss of hydride activity. The stability of 9-BBN towards air oxidation is unique 
among the dialkylboranes and is comparable to that of lithium aluminium 
hydride. Even so, some loss of purity attends exposure to the atmosphere. 
Consequently, for quantitative studies it is recommended that manipulation of 
solid 9-BBN be carried out as much as possible under a nitrogen atmosphere, in 
order to maintain the maximum hydride activity and purity. Solutions of 9-BBN 
on the other hand are highly reactive towards both oxygen and water and 
should be rigorously protected from these reactants. The reagent can be stored 
either as the solid or in tetrahydrofuran solution for indefinite periods without 
any noticeable change in activity provided that an inert atmosphere is 
maintained. 

A further synthetically useful borane, catecholborane (1,3,2-benzo- 
dioxaborole) is obtained by the reaction of borane with 1,2-dihydroxybenzene 
(catechol).

It is prepared as follows. 9 A 2 m solution of borane in tetrahydrofuran (100 ml, 
200 mmol), maintained under nitrogen, is placed in a dry 500-ml flask which is 
vented to a fume cupboard through a mercury bubbler. The flask is immersed in 
an ice bath and a solution of 1,2-dihydroxybenzene (catechol) (22 g, 200 mmol) 
in tetrahydrofuran (50 ml) is added over 30 minutes with efficient stirring to the 
borane solution at 0°C. After the completion of the addition, the reaction 
mixture is stirred at 25 °C for an additional 30 minutes. Distillation provides 
19.2g (80%) of catecholborane, b.p. 76-77 °C/100mmHg. An example of the 
use of catecholborane in synthesis is described in Expt 6.4. 

More recently, boranes such as diisopinocampheylborane and a-iso- 
pinocampheyl-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane have been shown to be valuable 
reagents for the synthesis of chiral compounds. 10 The reaction of borane with 
a-pinene gives diisopinocampheylborane 




+ BH, 




This reagent may be prepared in a state of high optical purity as follows. 11 A 
250-ml flask equipped with a septum inlet, a magnetic stirring bar, and a 
distillation condenser connected to a receiver cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath is 
charged with 5.05 ml (50 mmol) of borane-methyl sulphide complex and 15 ml 
of tetrahydrofuran, and 15.9 ml of a-pinene (100 mmol) (1) is added dropwise at 
°C. After the contents are stirred at °C for 3 hours, a mixture of dimethyl 
sulphide and tetrahydrofuran (13 ml) is removed under vacuum 
(0 °C/30mmHg), and the flask brought to atmospheric pressure by flushing with 
nitrogen gas and charged with 1 8 ml of tetrahydrofuran and 2.4 ml of a-pinene 
(15 mmol). It is then stored in the cold room at °C. An example of the use of 
diisopinocampheylborane in synthesis is described in Expt 5.45. 

Note. ( 1 ) Either ( + )- or ( — )-&lt;x-pinene may be used to give the corresponding optically 
active Ipc 2 BH derivatives. ( + )-a-Pinene (Aldrich) was 92 per cent ee (see p. 34). 

8. BORON TRIFLUORIDE 

This gas, b.p. — 101 °C, is available in cylinders and can be bubbled directly into 
the reaction mixture through a suitable safety trap. It is highly irritant and toxic 
and should only be handled in a suitable fume cupboard. For many preparative 
purposes it is convenient to use the commercially available boron trifluoride- 
etherate [BF 3 Et 2 0] which contains 48 per cent w/w of boron trifluoride. This 
reagent is a colourless liquid which frequently becomes very dark on storage, 
but is readily purified before use by adding 2 per cent by weight of dry ether, to 
ensure an excess, and distilling from calcium hydride under reduced pressure 
(b.p. 46°C/10mmHg). Further convenient sources of boron trifluoride are the 



421 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



liquid boron trifluoride-acetic acid complex* which contains about 40 per cent 
w/w of boron trifluoride, boron trifluoride-methanolt containing c. 51 per cent 
w/w BF 3 , and boron trifluoride-dimethyl sulphide complexf containing 12 per 
cent w/w BF 3 . 

9. BROMINE 

CAUTION: Bromine is extremely corrosive and must be handled with great care 
(preferably using protective gloves) and always in the fume cupboard. The liquid 
produces painful burns and the vapour is an extremely powerful irritant. 
Bromine burns should be treated immediately with a liberal quantity of glycerol. 
If the vapour is inhaled, relief may be obtained by soaking a handkerchief in 
ethanol and holding it near the nose. The commercial product may be dried 
(and partially purified) by shaking with an equal volume of concentrated 
sulphuric acid, and then separating the acid. Chlorine, if present, may be 
removed by fractionation in an all-glass apparatus from pure potassium 
bromide: the b.p. of pure bromine is 59 °C/760 mmHg. 

10. N-BROMOSUCCINIMIDE, CH 2 CONBr-CO-C H 2 

This reagent is available commercially and may be further purified by 
recrystallisation as rapidly as possible from ten times its weight of hot water or 
from glacial acetic acid. 

It can be prepared from succinimide by dissolving the latter in a slight molar 
excess of chilled sodium hydroxide solution (of approximately 3 m strength) and 
adding rapidly with vigorous stirring one molar proportion of bromine 
dissolved in an equal volume of carbon tetrachloride (CAUTION). A finely 
crystalline white product is obtained which may be collected, washed with ice- 
cold water, dried and used directly or recrystallised as detailed above. 

11. t-BUTYL HYPOCHLORITE 

This compound is a useful chlorinating reagent, and although relatively stable, 
its purification by distillation is not normally attempted. Primary and secondary 
hypochlorites readily explode when exposed to light, and even in the absence of 
light rapid decomposition occurs at room temperature. t-Butyl hypochlorite 
may be prepared by the interaction of t-butyl alcohol, sodium hydroxide and 
chlorine at low temperature, which must be carefully controlled during the 
reaction 

Me 3 COH + Cl 2 + NaOH &gt; Me 3 COCl + H 2 + NaCl 

The procedure is as follows. Assemble in a fume cupboard a 1 -litre three-necked 
flask fitted with a gas inlet tube extending almost to the bottom of the flask, a 
sealed stirrer unit and a gas outlet adapter (cf. Fig. 6.2) incorporating a 
thermometer extending well into the flask. Place in the flask a solution of 40 g 
(1 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 250 ml of water, and add 37 g (47 ml, 0.5 mol) of 
t-butyl alcohol followed by sufficient water (about 250 ml) to give a homo- 
geneous solution. Surround the flask with a bath of iced water, and pass chlorine 
(from a cylinder of the gas) steadily into the solution, with stirring, as long as the 
gas is absorbed, and then slowly for about 30 minutes more. Ensure that the

SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 20 °C throughout the 
addition. Transfer the product to a separating funnel, remove and discard the 
aqueous phase, and wash the upper layer with 25 ml portions of 10 per cent 
sodium carbonate solution until the washings are no longer acidic to Congo red 
indicator. Finally wash the product three times with cold water and dry over 
anhydrous calcium chloride. The yield of t-butyl hypochlorite, which is usually 
about 98 per cent pure, is 40-50 g (74-92%). It should be stored in a securely 
stoppered dark bottle in the cold; the vapour is powerfully lachrymatory. 

12. CADMIUM CHLORIDE 

Cadmium compounds are very toxic and a suitable face mask should be worn to 
prevent inhalation of dust. Anhydrous cadmium chloride can be obtained from 
the commercially available hydrated compound in the following way: dry the 
hydrate to constant weight at 110°C; grind finely, dry again for 2-3 hours at 
110°C and then place in a screw-capped bottle and keep in a desiccator over 
calcium chloride. The use of anhydrous cadmium chloride in synthesis is 
described in Expts 5.94 and 6.126. 

13. CARBON DIOXIDE 

This gas is conveniently generated from calcium carbonate chips (marble) and 
dilute hydrochloric acid (1 : 1) in a Kipp's apparatus; it should be passed through 
a Drechsel bottle containing water or sodium hydrogen carbonate solution to 
remove acid spray and, if required dry, through two further Drechsel bottles 
charged with concentrated sulphuric acid. 

Large quantities of carbon dioxide may be obtained from a cylinder of the 
liquefied gas; the gas should be dried by passing it through two Drechsel bottles 
containing concentrated sulphuric acid. A little air is present in the gas. 

For some purposes (e.g. in the Grignard reaction) solid carbon dioxide 
marketed as 'Cardice', 'Dry Ice' or 'Drikold' may be employed. Lumps of solid 
carbon dioxide should not be picked up with unprotected hands otherwise 
frostbite may result. If powdered material is required, the larger lumps should be 
wrapped in cloth and hammered. Solid carbon dioxide affords a convenient 
regulated supply of the gas when suitably sized lumps are allowed to evaporate 
in a Buchner flask attached to a sulphuric acid drying train. 

14. CARBON MONOXIDE 

Carbon monoxide is available in cylinders. It is very poisonous and all operations 
involving its generation and use must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard. 
The gas may be prepared in the laboratory by the action of concentrated 
sulphuric acid upon concentrated formic acid (d 1.2; about 90 per cent w/w 
HC0 2 H) at 70-80 °C. The apparatus shown in Fig. 4.3 employs a 500-ml 
round-bottomed flask fitted with a socket/cone adapter with 'T' connection and 
a stoppered pressure-equalising funnel. The gas is dried by passage through two 
Drechsel bottles containing concentrated sulphuric acid. The round-bottomed 
flask is charged with 125 g of concentrated sulphuric acid and 85 g of formic acid 
is slowly added from the dropping funnel; the pressure-equalising side-arm 
allows the addition process to be carefully controlled and this minimises 
excessive frothing. Frothing may be further controlled by the addition of a small 
quantity of liquid paraffin. The steady stream of carbon monoxide which is 
evolved may contain traces of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide; these 

423 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



To drying train 



Fig. 4.3 

impurities may be removed, if desired, by passage upwards through a glass 
column filled with potassium hydroxide pellets (cf. Fig. 4.2). 

15. CHLORINE 

Chlorine is a very toxic and irritant gas and all operations involving its generation 

and use must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard. For relatively large 

quantities of chlorine, cylinders of the gas fitted with an appropriate reducing 

valve should be used. The gas should be dried by passage through two Drechsel 

bottles containing concentrated sulphuric acid and then through a Drechsel 

bottle filled with glass wool to remove acid spray. Small quantities of chlorine 

are readily prepared by the action of concentrated hydrochloric acid upon 

potassium permanganate in the apparatus assembly shown in Fig. 4.3. The 

calculated quantity of potassium permanganate (0.367 g KMn0 4 = 0.412 g Cl 2 ) 

is placed in the round-bottomed flask and a slight excess of concentrated 

hydrochloric acid is placed in the pressure-equalising funnel which should then 

be stoppered and the stopper secured with an elastic band (1.000 g KMn0 4 

requires 6.2 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid). The chlorine is passed 

through a Drechsel bottle containing water to remove hydrogen chloride and is 

then dried by means of another Drechsel bottle charged with concentrated 

sulphuric acid; it is advisable to insert an empty Drechsel bottle to act as a safety 

trap between the reaction vessel and the dry chlorine generating source. The 

acid is allowed to drop slowly upon the permanganate crystals; the flask should 

be shaken from time to time. When about half the acid has been added, the 

evolution of gas tends to slow down; the flask should then be warmed slightly; 

after all the acid has been added the mixture is boiled gently to complete the 

evolution of chlorine. 

16. CHLOROSULPHONIC ACID (C1S0 3 H) 

This reagent must be handled with great care; it is very corrosive to the skin and 
clothing, and reacts with water with great violence. If the specimen is impure, or 
discoloured, it should be distilled in an all-glass apparatus and the fraction, b.p. 
148-1 50 °C/760mmHg, collected; due precautions should be taken to protect 
the distillate from moisture. 



424 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



17. CHLOROSULPHONYL ISOCYANATE (C1S0 2 NC0) 

Chlorosulphonyl isocyanate is a clear, colourless, mobile lachrymatory and 
corrosive liquid, m.p. -43 °C, b.p. 107-108 °C (38 °C/50mmHg). 12 CAUTION: 
Contact with the skin for more than a few seconds may result in severe burns. It 
should always be handled in a fume cupboard. The reagent may be stored for short 
periods in glass containers with rubber stoppers or for longer periods in sealed 
glass ampoules. Ground glass stoppers soon become frozen even when 
thoroughly lubricated with grease. Chlorosulphonyl isocyanate is thermally 
stable. It is the most chemically reactive isocyanate known. It fumes in moist air, 
reacts very violently with water, and is unstable in other protic solvents. It can 
be used in a number of aprotic solvents including aliphatic, aromatic and 
chlorinated hydrocarbons, ether (but not tetrahydrofuran) and acetonitrile. An 
example of its use in synthesis is described in Expt 8.8. 

18. CHROMIUM(Vl) OXIDISING AGENTS 

Chromium(vi) species are widely used as oxidising agents in organic chemistry. 
Chromium{y\) oxide (chromium trioxide, chromic anhydride) is a deliquescent, 
red crystalline substance. It is very soluble in water and in sulphuric acid, and is 
a very powerful oxidising agent which must be handled with care (Section 2.3.2, 
p. 35). It is often used as a solution in acetic acid (Expts 6.123 and 6.130) or 
acetic anhydride (Expt 6.117). The solution of chromium(vi) oxide in acetic 
anhydride is prepared by adding chromium trioxide portionwise to the well- 
cooled acetic anhydride. Addition of the anhydride to the oxide in bulk may lead 
to explosive decomposition. Sodium dichromate in aqueous sulphuric acid (see 
Expt 5.86 for preparation) is also used for a variety of oxidations including 
simple primary alcohols to aldehydes (Expt 5.74 and Section 9.6.4; p. 1241) 
secondary alcohols to ketones (Expts 5.86 and 5.87), and alkylboranes to 
ketones (Expt 5.89). Acidic dichromate is not a generally useful reagent for the 
oxidation of primary alcohols since the aldehydes produced are readily oxidised 
in turn to carboxylic acids. Selective oxidation with chromium(vi) species can 
however be carried out successfully in aprotic media, using recently developed 
chromium(vi) species. Two complexes of chromium(vi) oxide with pyridine are 
useful selective oxidants for primary alcohols and other alcohols containing 
acid-sensitive groups: pyridinium dichromate, and pyridinium chlorochromate. 
One procedure for the oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols with 
dipyridine chromium(vi) oxide (pyridinium dichromate, PDC) is as follows. 13 
Chromium trioxide 6.00 g (60 mmol) is added to a magnetically stirred solution 
of 9.49 g (120mmol) of dry pyridine in 150 ml of dry dichloromethane. The flask 
is stoppered with a drying tube containing drierite, and the deep burgundy 
solution is stirred for 1 5 minutes at room temperature. At the end of this period 
a solution of the alcohol (10 mmol) in a small volume of dichloromethane is 
added in one portion. A tarry black deposit separates immediately; after stirring 
for an additional 1 5 minutes at room temperature, the solution is decanted from 
the residue, which is washed with 200 ml of ether. The combined organic 
solutions are washed with three 100 ml portions of 5 per cent aqueous sodium 
hydroxide solution, 100 ml of 5 per cent aqueous hydrochloric acid, 100 ml of 5 
per cent aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, 100 ml of saturated 
aqueous sodium chloride and dried over magnesium sulphate. Alternatively, the 
decanted dichloromethane solution is concentrated in vacuo and the residue 
taken up in ether, filtered to remove insoluble chromium salts, washed with 

425 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



dilute aqueous base and saturated brine, and dried over magnesium sulphate. 
Evaporation of the solvent at reduced pressure affords the crude aldehyde or 
ketone product. Examples of the use of this procedure are: octan-2-ol (97% yield 
of crude carbonyl compound); octan-1-ol (90%); benzyl alcohol (89%); borneol 
(89%); cinnamyl alcohol (96%). 

Pyridinium chlorochr ornate (PCC) is a stable complex formed from chromium 
trioxide and pyridine in the presence of hydrochloric acid. Pyridinium 
chlorochromate is mildly acidic and therefore not suitable for acid-sensitive 
substrates or products. It provides an alternative and complementary selective 
oxidising agent to pyridinium dichromate. It is commercially available, but can 
easily be prepared as follows. 14 To 184 ml of 6 m hydrochloric acid (1.1 mol) is 
added 100 g (1 mol) of chromium(vi) oxide rapidly with stirring. After 5 minutes 
the homogeneous solution is cooled to 0°C and 79.1 g (1 mol) of pyridine 
(CAUTION) is carefully added over 10 minutes. Re-cooling to 0°C gives a 
yellow-orange solid which is collected on a sintered glass funnel and dried for 
1 hour in vacuo (yield 180.8g, 84%). The solid is not appreciably hygroscopic 
and can be stored for extended periods at room temperature without change. An 
example of the use of pyridinium chlorochromate is the oxidation of heptan-1-ol 
to heptanal (Expt 5.76). 

Pyridinium chlorochromate adsorbed on alumina is convenient for some 
applications. 15 To a solution of chromium trioxide (6g) in 6 m hydrochloric acid 
(1 1 ml) is added pyridine (4.75 g) within 10 minutes at 40 °C. The mixture is kept 
at 10 °C until a yellow-orange solid forms. Reheating to 40 °C gives a solution. 
Alumina (50 g) is then added to the solution with stirring at 40 °C. After 
evaporation in a rotary evaporator, the orange solid is dried in vacuo for 2 hours 
at room temperature. The reagent can be kept for several weeks under vacuum 
in the dark without losing its activity. A typical procedure for the use of this 
reagent is the oxidation of carveol to carvone (Expt 5.88). 

19. COPPER 

Copper powder is prepared by dissolving 100 grams of recrystallised copper(n) 
sulphate in 350 ml of hot water in a 1 -litre beaker; a magnetic stirrer is provided. 
After cooling to the laboratory temperature, the stirrer is set in motion and 35 g 
(or more, if necessary) of purified zinc powder (see 4.2.50, Zinc) are gradually 
added until the solution is decolourised. The precipitated copper is washed by 
decantation with water. Dilute hydrochloric acid (5%) is added to the 
precipitate in order to remove the excess of zinc, and stirring is continued until 
the evolution of hydrogen ceases. The copper powder is filtered, washed with 
water and kept in a moist condition (as a paste) in a stoppered bottle. 

Activated copper bronze is essential for satisfactory yields in the Ullmann 
reaction, and uniform results can be obtained by the following activation 
process. One hundred grams of copper bronze are treated with 1 litre of a 2 per 
cent solution of iodine in acetone for 5-10 minutes. This results in the 
production of a rather greyish colour due to the formation of copper iodide. The 
product is filtered off on a Buchner funnel, removed and washed by stirring with 
500 ml of 1 : 1 solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid in acetone. The copper 
iodide dissolves, and the residual copper bronze is filtered and washed with 
acetone. It is then dried in a vacuum desiccator. The activated copper bronze 
should be used immediately after preparation.

20. COPPER-CHROMIUM OXIDE CATALYST ('COPPER CHROMITE' 
CATALYST) 

A reactive form of copper-chromium oxide suitable for hydrogenations (see 
Section 2.17.1, p. 87) may be obtained by the decomposition of basic copper 
ammonium chromate; the main reactions may be written as: 

2Cu(NO,) 2 + Na 2 Cr 2 7 + 4NH 3 + 3H 2 

-^&gt; 2CuNH 4 (OH)Cr0 4 + 2NaN0 3 + 2NH 4 N0 3 

^X CuOCuCr 2 4 + N 2 + 5H 2 

The most active forms contain barium chromite, which is incorporated by 
adding barium nitrate to the reaction mixture. The barium in the catalyst gives 
protection against sulphate poisoning and is said to stabilise the catalyst against 
reduction. 

Dissolve 15.5 g of barium nitrate (AnalaR) and 130g of copper(n) nitrate 
trihydrate (AnalaR) in 450 ml of water at 80 °C. Prepare a solution of sodium 
chromate by dissolving 89 g of recrystallised sodium dichromate dihydrate 
in 200 ml of water and adding 112.5ml of concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.880). 
Add the warm solution (80 °C) of nitrates in a thin stream, with stir- 
ring, to the sodium chromate solution (at 25 °C). Collect the orange precipitate 
by suction filtration, wash it with two 50 ml portions of water, drain well and dry 
at 75-80 °C for 12 hours; powder finely. 

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a funnel for introducing a solid, a 
wide air condenser and a stainless steel stirrer with crescent blade, 1 cm long and 
8 cm wide, so shaped that it conforms to the bottom of the flask. Immerse the 
flask in a metal bath at 350 °C. Add the powder through the funnel, with rapid 
stirring, during a period of 15 minutes. Heat with stirring at a bath temperature 
of 350 °C for 20 minutes after all the solid has been added. Leach the product by 
stirring for 30 minutes with 300 ml of 10 per cent acetic acid at room 
temperature (1). Allow to settle, decant the solution and wash the residue with 
six 50-60 ml portions of water. Filter with suction on a Buchner funnel, dry at 
125 °C for 12 hours and grind finely in a mortar. The yield of catalyst (a 
brownish-black powder) is 85 g. No special precautions are necessary in 
handling or storing the catalyst since it is unaffected by exposure to air or 
moisture. 

Note. (1) This treatment removes a substantial proportion of the excess of copper(u) 
oxide and renders the catalyst more active for hydrogenation purposes. 

A copper-chromium oxide on pumice catalyst has particular value for the 
dehydrogenation of primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding 
carbonyl compounds (see Section 5.6.1, p. 581). Dissolve 10.4g of barium nitrate 
(AnalaR) in 280 ml of water at about 80 °C and add to this hot solution 87 g of 
copper(n) nitrate trihydrate (AnalaR); stir the mixture and heat until a 
homogeneous solution results. Prepare a solution of 50.4 g of recrystallised 
ammonium dichromate in a mixture of 200 ml of water and 75 ml of 
concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.880). To the ammonium chromate solution 
at 25-30 °C add the hot (80 °C) nitrate solution in a thin stream with stirring. 
Allow the mixture to cool and filter off the yellowish-brown precipitate with 
suction; press with a glass stopper and suck as dry as possbile. Transfer the 

427 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



precipitate of copper barium ammonium chromate to a large evaporating dish, 
add sufficient water to form a moderately thick paste and introduce pumice (4-8 
mesh) with stirring until most of the paste has been transferred to the pumice; 
about 300 g of pumice are required. Heat on an electric hot-plate until the 
particles of pumice no longer adhere one to another. Remove the impregnated 
pumice (yellowish-brown) to a small evaporating dish and heat, by means of a 
Bunsen flame, with stirring until the colour changes through brown to a uniform 
black. 

21. COPPER(I) BROMIDE 

Dissolve 45 g (0.18 mol) of copper(n) sulphate pentahydrate and 19 g (0.19 mol) 
of sodium bromide in 1 50 ml of water. Add, with stirring, a solution of 1 1 .8 g of 
sodium metabisulphite in 120 ml of water to the hot solution during 5 minutes 
(1). If the blue colour is not completely discharged, add a little more sodium 
metabisulphite. Cool the mixture and decant the supernatant liquor. Wash the 
precipitate by decantation with water containing a little dissolved sulphur 
dioxide to prevent oxidation. A solution of copper(i) bromide may be prepared 
by dissolving the moist solid in 30 ml of constant boiling point hydrobromic 
acid (48% w/w HBr). If however the solid salt is required collect the precipitate 
in a Buchner funnel, wash with water containing a little dissolved sulphur 
dioxide, followed by ethanol and then ether each containing sulphur dioxide and 
press with a glass stopper. Remove residual solvent and finally dry the solid in a 
vacuum desiccator over sulphuric acid and potassium hydroxide. 

4CuS0 4 + 4NaBr + Na 2 S 2 5 + 3H 2 &gt; 4CuBr + 6NaHS0 4 

Note. (1) Alternatively pass a stream of sulphur dioxide through the heated solution 
(60 °C) for about 2 hours. 

An alternative means of preparation of a solution of copper(i) bromide 
involves heating under reflux a mixture of 63 g (0.25 mol) of copper(n) sulphate 
pentahydrate, 20g (0.314mol) of copper turnings, 114g (1.109 mol) of sodium 
bromide, 30 g (16.3 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid and 1 litre of water for 3-4 
hours. If the colour of the solution has not become yellowish after this period of 
heating, a few grams of sodium sulphite should be added to complete the 
reduction. 

CuS0 4 + Cu + 2NaBr ► 2CuBr + Na 2 S0 4 

22. COPPER(I) CHLORIDE 

Dissolve 35 g (0.1 4 mol) of copper(n) sulphate pentahydrate and 9.2 g 
(0.1 57 mol) of pure sodium chloride in 125 ml of water; warming may be necessary. 
Add a solution of 8.4 g (0.044 mol) of sodium metabisulphite (1) in 90 ml of water 
to the hot solution during about 5 minutes with constant shaking. Cool to room 
temperature (use an ice bath if neccessary) and decant the supernatant liquor 
from the colourless copper(i) chloride. Wash the precipitate twice by decanta- 
tion with water containing a little dissolved sulphur dioxide, the latter to prevent 
oxidation. For most purposes a solution of copper(i) chloride is required: the 
moist copper(i) chloride is dissolved in 60 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. 
The solution should be used within 24 hours of its preparation as it tends to 
oxidise (and therefore darken) on keeping. If it is not to be used immediately, the 
solution is kept in a tightly stoppered bottle (2). If the dry solid copper(i) 

428 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



chloride is required, the moist solid should be washed several times by 
decantation with water containing sulphur dioxide, collected on a Buchner 
funnel, washed several times with small portions of glacial acetic acid and dried 
in an air oven at 100-120 °C until the odour of acetic acid has disappeared. The 
copper(i) chloride thus obtained has a pure white colour and should be kept in a 
tightly stoppered bottle. The yield is almost quantitative. 

4CuS0 4 + 4NaCl + Na 2 S 2 5 + 3H 2 &gt; 4CuCl + 6NaHS0 4 

Notes. (1) The reduction may also be effected with an alkaline solution of sodium 
sulphite prepared from 8.4 g of sodium metabisulphite and 7.0 g of sodium hydroxide 
pellets in 90 ml of water. The reaction is probably: 

2CuS0 4 + 4NaCl + Na 2 S0 3 + H 2 &gt; 2CuCl + 3Na 2 S0 4 + 2HC1 

(2) An alternative means of preparation of a solution of copper(i) chloride is given 
under Expt 6.71. 

23. COPPER(I) CYANIDE 

The preparation is based essentially upon the reaction formulated below. It 
should be carried out in the fume cupboard and great caution exercised in the 
handling of the cyanides. 

4CuS0 4 + 4NaCN + Na 2 S 2 5 + 3H 2 &gt; 4CuCN + 6NaHS0 4 

Place 500 g (2mol) of powdered copper(n) sulphate pentahydrate in a 3-litre 
beaker or round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer and dissolve in 1 600 ml 
of water at 40-50 °C. Prepare solutions of 140g (0.74 mol) of commercial 
sodium metabisulphite in 400 ml of water (^4) and of 140g (2. 15 mol) of 
potassium cyanide (96-99% purity) (CAUTION) in 400 ml of water (B), and 
filter if necessary from small amounts of insoluble matter. Warm solutions A and 
B separately to 60 °C. Make the copper(n) sulphate solution faintly acid to 
Congo red with dilute sulphuric acid and add solution A with mechanical 
stirring during 1-2 minutes, followed immediately by solution B. There is a 
slight frothing, a little sulphur dioxide is evolved, but no appreciable amount of 
cyanogen or hydrogen cyanide. After about 10 minutes, filter the hot solution 
and wash the product thoroughly with boiling water, and finally with rectified 
spirit. Dry at 100-1 10 °C to a fine soft powder (24-36 hours). The yield is 167g 
(93%). 

The most satisfactory method of preparation of a copper(i) cyanide solution is 
to dissolve the copper(i) cyanide (90 g, 1 mol) in a solution of sodium cyanide 
(125g, 2.5 mol) (CAUTION) in 600 ml of water. If it is desired to avoid the 
preparation of solid copper(i) cyanide, the following procedure may be adopted. 
Copper(i) chloride, prepared from 35 g of copper(n) sulphate pentahydrate as 
described under 22 above, is suspended in 60 ml of water contained in a 500-ml 
round-bottomed flask, which is fitted with a mechanical stirrer. A solution of 
18.5 g of sodium cyanide (96-98%) in 30 ml of water is added and the mixture is 
stirred. The copper(i) chloride passes into solution with considerable evolution 
of heat. As the copper(i) cyanide is usually employed in reactions with solutions 
of aryl diazonium salts it is usual to cool the resulting copper(i) cyanide solution 
in ice.

24. DIALKYL SULPHATES 

Dimethyl sulphate [Me 2 S0 4 ] is a liquid of b.p. 188.5 °C and is practically 
without odour. CAUTION: Both vapour and liquid dimethyl sulphate are highly 
poisonous and the substance should only be used in a fume cupboard with a good 
draught, and rubber gloves should be worn. Inhalation of vapour may lead to 
giddiness or even more serious results. The liquid itself is readily absorbed 
through the skin, with toxic results. If the liquid is accidentally splashed upon 
the hands, wash immediately with much concentrated ammonia solution in 
order to hydrolyse the compound before it can be absorbed through the skin; 
then rub gently with a wad of cotton wool soaked in ammonia solution. 

Commercial dimethyl sulphate may be purified by, (a) allowing it to stand 
over anhydrous potassium carbonate until it is neutral to Congo red paper, or 
(b) by washing, just before use, with an equal volume of ice-water, followed by 
one-third of its volume of cold, saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, 
and finally drying over calcium oxide. In both cases the purified dimethyl 
sulphate is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure from calcium oxide and 
the fraction having b.p. 72-73°C/13mmHg collected. 

Diethyl sulphate [Et 2 S0 4 ] is somewhat less poisonous than dimethyl 
sulphate, but similar precautions in the use and handling of this reagent should 
be observed; all operations should be conducted in the fume cupboard and 
rubber gloves should be worn. If the diethyl sulphate is dark in colour, it should 
be placed in a separatory funnel of suitable size and washed first with ice-water, 
then with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution until free of acid and 
finally dried over successive portions of calcium oxide. The dried diethyl 
sulphate is fractionally distilled from calcium oxide and has b.p. 
93°C/13mmHg. 

25. DIAZOMETHANE 

CAUTION: Liquid diazomethane, CH 2 N 2 , b.p. —24°C, is an explosive com- 
pound and explosions may also occur in the gaseous state if the substance is dry 
and undiluted. The gas may be handled with safety by diluting it with nitrogen. 
For synthetic work, a dry dilute ethereal solution of the gas is employed and this 
can be handled with reasonable safety, although such solutions have also been 
known to explode. However, due regard must be paid to the highly toxic character 
of the gas by carrying out all operations in an efficient fume cupboard. 

An ethereal solution of diazomethane is usually prepared immediately before 
it is required for reaction. A convenient precursor for the generation of 
diazomethane is JV-methyl-iV-nitrosotoluene-p-sulphonamide which is prepared 
by the action of nitrous acid on JV-methyltoluene-p-sulphonamide. This latter is 
formed from toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride and methylamine in alkaline solu- 
tion. The methylnitrosamide affords diazomethane on reaction with potassium 
hydroxide solution.

N-Methyl-N-nitrosotoluene-y-sulphonamide.* Divide 320 g (1.68 mol) of purified 
toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride, m.p. 68-69 °C (Section 4.2.75, p. 466) into three 
portions of 1 90, 90 and 40 g. Prepare a solution of 70 g (1 .75 mol) of sodium 
hydroxide in 70 ml of water and cool to room temperature. Place 210 ml 
(2.25 mol) of 33 per cent aqueous methylamine solution (or 174 ml of the 40% 
aqueous solution) in a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask and add the 190g of 
toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride in portions with swirling during about 5 minutes. 
The mixture becomes warm. Allow the temperature to rise to 80-90 °C in order 
to maintain the JV-methyltoluene-p-sulphonamide (m.p. 78 °C) in a molten 
condition, otherwise the latter may form a hard cake and reaction may be 
incomplete; also do not permit the temperature to rise above 90 °C as 
appreciable loss of methylamine may result. The mixture should be acid to 
litmus within 5 minutes after the completion of the first addition of the 
sulphonyl chloride (1). Then add 50 ml of the 50 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution carefully with swirling, followed immediately by 90 g of the sulphonyl 
chloride in portions as before. When the mixture has again become acidic (1), 
introduce 25 ml of the sodium hydroxide solution, followed by 40 g of toluene- 
p-sulphonyl chloride with vigorous swirling. After the mixture has again become 
acidic, add the remainder of the sodium hydroxide solution. The liquid phase of 
the final mixture should be alkaline; if it is acidic, indicating excessive loss of 
methylamine, add sufficient methylamine solution to render the mixture basic. 
Rinse the walls of the flask with a little water and complete the reaction by 
heating the mixture (which consists of two layers and a precipitate of sodium 
chloride) on a boiling water bath for 15 minutes with vigorous mechanical 
stirring. Pour the hot reaction mixture into 1500 ml of glacial acetic acid 
contained in a 4-litre round-bottomed flask; rinse the flask with 250 ml of acetic 
acid. Cool the solution in an ice bath to 5 °C (2), stir mechanically and add a 
solution of 125 g (1.8 mol) of sodium nitrite in 250 ml of water from a dropping 
funnel during about 45 minutes: maintain the temperature below 10 °C and 
continue the stirring for 1 5 minutes after the addition is complete. The nitroso 
derivative separates as a yellow crystalline solid during the reaction. Add 1 litre 
of water to the reaction mixture and collect the precipitate by suction filtration; 
press it on the funnel and wash with about 500 ml of water. Transfer the product 
to a beaker, stir it well with about 400 ml of water, then filter and wash again on 
the funnel until the odour of acetic acid is no longer apparent. Dry to constant 
weight in a vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulphuric acid. The yield of 
JV-methyl-N-nitrosotoluene-p-sulphonamide, m.p. 58-60 °C, is 325 g (90%). This is 
sufficiently pure for the preparation of diazomethane. It should be kept in a dark 
bottle. It may be recrystallised by dissolution in boiling ether (1 ml/g), addition 
of an equal volume of light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C, and cooling in a 
refrigerator. This reagent may be stored for long periods at room temperature in 
a dark bottle without appreciable decomposition. 

Notes. (1) Occasionally the liquid may not become acidic after the first or second 
addition, even though the sulphonyl chloride has reacted completely (this is due to a 
smaller loss of methylamine than is expected). If such is the case, no more than 5 minutes 
should be allowed between successive additions of sulphonyl chloride and alkali. The 
whole procedure occupies about 30 minutes.

4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(2) A reaction temperature below °C should be avoided because the total volume of 
acetic acid is just sufficient to keep the Af-methyltoluene-p-sulphonamide in solution 
above °C. 

Preparation of diazomethane. CAUTION: This preparation should be carried out 
only in a fume cupboard provided with a powerful exhaust system. The use of a 
screen of safety glass in addition to wearing safety spectacles is essential. Since 
the explosive decomposition of diazomethane is frequently initiated by rough or 
sharp surfaces the use of apparatus with ground glass joints and of boiling chips 
in the subsequent distillation is not recommended. New glass apparatus with 
rubber stopper connections carrying fire-polished glass connecting tubes, or 
glass apparatus with Clearjoints should be used. A further precaution against 
explosion is to ensure that the apparatus assembly, located in a fume cupboard, 
is not exposed to direct sunlight or placed near a strong artificial light. 

The following procedures may be used for the preparation of ethereal 
solutions of diazomethane containing ethanol; they differ slightly according to 
whether large or small quantities are required. The presence of ethanol is not 
harmful in many uses of diazomethane. 

Method 1. Add 50 ml of 96 per cent ethanol to a solution of 10 g (0.18 mol) of 
potassium hydroxide in 15 ml of water. Place this solution in a 200-ml 
distillation flask equipped with a dropping funnel and an efficient double surface 
condenser. Fit by means of rubber bungs and glass tube connectors two 
receiving flasks (of 500 ml and 100 ml capacity) in series to the end of the 
condenser; cool both the flasks in an ice-salt mixture and arrange that the inlet 
tube leading into the second smaller receiver flask dips below the surface of a 
charge of 40 ml of ether. This will serve to trap any uncondensed diazomethane- 
ether vapour escaping from the first receiver. Heat the distilling flask in a water 
bath at 60-65 °C; place a solution of 43 g (0.2 mol) of N-methyl-JV- 
nitrosotoluene-p-sulphonamide in about 250 ml of ether in the dropping funnel 
and introduce it into the flask over a period of 45 minutes. Adjust the rate of 
addition so that it is about equal to the rate of distillation. When the dropping 
funnel is empty, add more ether (c. 30 ml) gradually until the ether distilling over 
is colourless. The combined ethereal solutions in the receivers contain 5.9-6.1 g 
(70%) of diazomethane (1). 

Method 2. For smaller quantities of diazomethane, the use of a dropping funnel 
is unnecessary. Dissolve 2.14g of JV-methyl-iV-nitrosotoluene-p-sulphonamide in 
30 ml of ether, cool in ice and add a solution of 0.4 g of potassium hydroxide in 
10 ml of 96 per cent ethanol. If a precipitate forms, add more ethanol until it just 
dissolves. After 5 minutes, distil the ethereal diazomethane solution from a water 
bath. The ethereal solution contains 0.32-0.35 g of diazomethane (1). 

Method 3. An ethereal solution of diazomethane free from ethanol may be 
prepared by this method: such a solution is required, for example, in the Arndt- 
Eistert reaction with acid chlorides (compare Expt 5.130). In a 100-ml distilling 
flask provided with a dropping funnel and an efficient downward condenser, 
place a solution of 6 g of potassium hydroxide in 1 ml of water, 3 5 ml of carbitol 
(diethyleneglycol monoethyl ether) and 10 ml of water: connect the condenser to 
two conical flasks in series containing 10 and 35 ml of ether respectively and 
cooled in an ice-salt bath (see Method 1). Heat the mixture on a water bath at 
70-75 °C in a beaker of water placed upon a hot-plate incorporating a magnetic 

432 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 47 



stirring unit with a Teflon-coated follower situated in the flask. As soon as the 
ether commences to distil, add a solution of 21.5 g of JV-methyl-iV- 
nitrosotoluene-p-sulphonamide in 125 ml of ether through the dropping funnel 
during a period of about 15 minutes, stirring electromagnetically. After the 
addition of the nitrosoamide, add 30-40 ml of ether through the dropping funnel 
and distil until the distillate is colourless. The ethereal solution in the conical 
flasks contains about 3.4 g of diazomethane (1). 

The diazomethane-ether solutions prepared by all these methods should be 
dry. If in doubt, it may be dried with potassium hydroxide pellets. The 
anhydrous ethereal solution may be stored in the fume cupboard in a smooth 
glass flask or bottle for a day or so at — 70 °C; since slow decomposition occurs 
with liberation of gas, the containing vessel should be protected by a calcium 
chloride guard-tube. 

Note. (1) To determine the exact diazomethane content, allow an aliquot portion of the 
ethereal diazomethane solution to react with an accurately weighted amount (say, about 
1 g) of benzoic acid (AnalaR) in 50 ml of anhydrous ether. The solution should be 
completely decolourised, thus showing that the benzoic acid is present in excess. Dilute 
the solution with water and titrate the excess of benzoic acid with standard 0.1 m alkali 
using phenolphthalein as indicator. 

General methylation procedure with diazomethane. The reaction must be carried 
out in the fume cupboard. Dissolve 2-3 g of the compound (say, a phenol or a 
carboxylic acid) in a little anhydrous ether or absolute methanol, cool in ice and 
add the ethereal solution of diazomethane in small portions until gas evolution 
ceases and the solution acquires a pale yellow colour. Test the coloured solution 
for the presence of excess of diazomethane by removing a few drops into a test 
tube and introducing a glass rod moistened with glacial acetic acid: immediate 
evolution of gas should occur. Evaporate the solvent, and purify the product by 
distillation or crystallisation. 

26. DIETHYL CARBONATE 

Commercial diethyl carbonate may be purified by the following process. Wash 
100 ml of diethyl carbonate successively with 20 ml of 10 per cent sodium 
carbonate solution, 20 ml of saturated calcium chloride solution and 25 ml of 
water. Allow to stand for 1 hour over anhydrous calcium chloride with 
occasional shaking, filter into a dry flask containing 5 g of the same desiccant, 
and allow to stand for a further hour. Distil and collect the fraction boiling at 
125-126 °C. Diethyl carbonate combines with anhydrous calcium chloride 
slowly and prolonged contact should therefore be avoided. Anhydrous calcium 
sulphate may also be used. 

27. JVA-DICYCLOHEXYLCARBODIIMIDE (DCC; C 6 H n N=C=N C 6 H n ) 
The reagent is a potent skin irritant and may cause sensitisation; it must be 
handled with care. Material of good quality (c. 99% pure) is available 
commercially as a waxy low-melting solid, m.p. 34-35 °C. It is most convenient 
to liquefy the reagent by the use of a hot-air blower or by standing the reagent 
bottle in a little warm water to assist weighing out. 

In most of its applications the reagent acts as a dehydrating condensing agent 
and is often recovered as dicyclohexylurea. Although the reagent is not unduly 
expensive, it may be desirable to make use of the recovered urea; the latter may 

433 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



be converted into the diimide by treatment in pyridine solution with toluene-p- 
sulphonyl chloride, phosphorus oxychloride or phosphoric oxide. 

To prepare DCC from dicyclohexylurea recrystallise the recovered urea from 
ethanol; m.p. 234 °C. Add dropwise with stirring 17.1 g (47 ml, 0.11 mol) of 
phosphorus oxychloride to 22.5 g (0.1 mol) of dicyclohexylurea in 50 ml of 
pyridine at 50 °C, and heat at 60-90 °C for 1 .5 hours. Pour the reaction product 
on to crushed ice, extract with light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) and dry the 
extract over anhydrous sodium sulphate. Remove the solvent using a rotary 
evaporator and distil the residual oil under reduced pressure. The yield of 
diimide, b.p. 157-159 °C/1 5 mmHg (131 °C/3-4mmHg), is about 14g (68%). 

28. ETHYLENE OXIDE 

The reagent has b.p. 11 °C and is supplied either in 100-ml sealed tubes or in 
100-ml cylinders equipped with an appropriate valve. The gas, which is highly 
flammable, has no very distinctive smell and must be regarded as a hazardous 
toxic reagent which must not be inhaled or allowed to come into contact with 
the skin and eyes. Precautions in the use of ethylene oxide are described in Expt 
5.39, which may be regarded as typical. 

29. FORMALDEHYDE 

Commercial formalin is an aqueous solution containing 37-40 per cent w/v of 
formaldehyde (0.37-0.40 g HCHO per ml), stabilised by the addition of 12 per 
cent of methanol. 

When dry gaseous formaldehyde is required it may be obtained by the 
depolymerisation of paraformaldehyde at 180-200 °C. For reactions at elevated 
temperatures dried paraformaldehyde may be used as the in situ source of 
formaldehyde (Expt. 5.39). 

30. GIRARD'S REAGENTS T AND 'P' 

Girard's reagent 'T' is carbohydrazidomethyltrimethylammonium chloride (1) 
(trimethylaminoacetohydrazide chloride) and is prepared by the reaction of the 
quaternary ammonium salt formed from ethyl chloroacetate and trimethyl- 
amine with hydrazine hydrate in alcoholic solution. 

Me 3 N + ClCH 2 -C0 2 Et »■ Cl e {Me 3 N-CH 2 -C0 2 Et NHrNH2 &gt; 

Cl e {Me 3 N-CH 2 -CONH-NH 2 + EtOH 

(1) 

Girard's reagent 'P' is the corresponding pyridinium compound, prepared by 
replacing the trimethylamine by pyridine. The reagent 'T', unlike the reagent 'P', 
is very deliquescent, but is nevertheless widely used for laboratory work because 
of its greater solubility. The quaternary ammonium grouping imparts water 
solubility. 

The main use of the Girard reagents 'T' and 'P' is for the isolation of small 
amounts of ketones from admixture with other organic matter contained in, for 
example, various natural products; the carbonyl derivatives are water-soluble. 
The ketonic material, dissolved in ethanol containing 10 per cent acetic acid, is 
heated for 30-60 minutes with the reagent in slight excess, the volume being 
adjusted to give a 5 to 10 per cent solution of the reagent. The cooled solution is 

434 



SOLVENTS ANO REAGENTS 4.2 



diluted with water containing enough alkali to neutralise 90 per cent of the acid 
and to give an alcohol content of 10-20 per cent. It is then exhaustively extracted 
with ether to remove non-ketonic compounds; the water-soluble hydrazone 
derivatives are decomposed by the addition of mineral acid up to a con- 
centration of 0.5 m and, after about 1 hour at room temperature, the liberated 
ketonic compound is isolated by extraction with ether. 

EtOH, AcOH e 9 

ReagentT + R'-COR 2 . Cl{Me 3 N-CH 2 -CONH-N=CR'R 2 + H 2 

To prepare Girard's reagent 'T\ place a solution of 98.5 g (84.5 ml, 0.8 mol) of ethyl 
chloroacetate and 200 ml of absolute ethanol in a 1 -litre, three-necked flask, 
fitted with a thermometer, stirrer and an ice-cooled condenser (Fig. 2.23). Cool 
the solution to °C by stirring in an ice-salt bath, stop the stirrer and add 49 g 
(74 ml, 0.83 mol), measured after precooling to — 5 °C, of trimethylamine all at 
once. Control the exothermic reaction sufficiently by external cooling so that the 
temperature of the mixture rises to 60 °C during about 1 hour. When there is no 
further evolution of heat, allow the reaction mixture to stand at room 
temperature for 20-24 hours. Remove the condenser, replace the thermometer 
by a dropping funnel and add 40 g (0.8 mol) of 100 per cent hydrazine hydrate 
(Section 4.2 .31) (CAUTION) with stirring during 10-15 minutes. Stir for a 
further 45 minutes, cool the solution slightly and, unless crystallisation 
commences spontaneously, scratch the walls of the vessel with a glass rod to 
induce crystallisation. The product separates in fine colourless needles. Cool in 
an ice bath, collect the highly hygroscopic salt rapidly on a Buchner funnel, 
wash with 150 ml of cold absolute ethanol and press dry. Dry the product in a 
vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulphuric acid; the yield is 105 g (85%), 
m.p. 175-180 °C (decomp.). (This material (1) contains a small amount of the 
symmetrical dihydrazide, but is quite satisfactory as a reagent for the separation 
of ketones.) A further crop of 1 2 g may be obtained after distilling off 200-300 ml 
of solvent from the mother-liquor and washings at the pressure of the water 
pump. 

Note. (1) The deliquescent solid must be stored in a dry, tightly -stoppered container. If 
exposed to the air it deteriorates rapidly, developing an unpleasant odour. Samples that 
have been kept for some time are best recrystallised from absolute ethanol before use. 

For Girard's reagent \P' (C 5 H 5 N-CH 2 -CO-NH-NH 2 }Cl) equip a 1 -litre, 
three-necked flask, with a sealed stirrer unit, a dropping funnel and a reflux 
condenser, and add 200 ml of absolute ethanol, 63 g (64.5 ml, 0.8 mol) of pure 
anhydrous pyridine (CAUTION) and 98.5 g (84.5 ml, 0.8 mol) of ethyl 
chloroacetate. Heat the mixture under reflux for 2-3 hours until the formation of 
the quaternary salt is complete; acidify a small test-portion with dilute sulphuric 
acid; it should dissolve completely and no odour of ethyl chloroacetate should 
be apparent. Cool the mixture in ice and salt. Run in rapidly from a dropping 
funnel a solution of 40 g (0.8 mol) of 100 per cent hydrazine hydrate 
(CAUTION) in 50 ml of absolute ethanol all at once. A vigorous exothermic 
reaction soon develops and is accompanied by vigorous effervescence. The 
product separates almost immediately. When cold, filter with suction, wash with 
ice-cold ethanol and dry in the air. The yield of Girard's reagent 'P' is 135 g 

435 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(90%); this is satisfactory for the isolation of ketones. A pure product may be 
obtained by recrystallisation from methanol. 

31. HYDRAZINE HYDRATE 

CAUTION: Hydrazine is a suspected carcinogen and therefore should be handled 
with appropriate precautions. Hydrazine hydrate containing 60 per cent w/w and 
98-100 per cent w/w NHj-NHj^O is available commercially (1). A hydrazine 
solution, 60 per cent w/w of hydrazine hydrate, may be concentrated as follows. 
A mixture of 1 50 g ( 1 44 ml) of the solution and 230 ml of xylene is distilled from a 
500-ml round-bottomed flask through a well-lagged Hempel (or other efficient 
fractionating) column in an atmosphere of nitrogen. All the xylene passes over 
with about 85 ml of water. Upon distillation of the residue, about 50 g of 90-95 
per cent hydrazine hydrate (2) are obtained. 

Notes. (1 ) Solutions of hydrazine hydrate are extremely corrosive; protective gloves and 
safety spectacles should always be worn when handling this reagent. 
(2) Hydrazine hydrate may be titrated with standard acid using methyl orange as 
indicator or, alternatively, against standard iodine solution with starch as indicator. In 
the latter case about 0. 1 g, accurately weighed, of the hydrazine hydrate solution is 
diluted with about 100 ml of water, 2-3 drops of starch indicator added, and immediately 
before titration 5 g of sodium bicarbonate are introduced. Rapid titration with iodine 
gives a satisfactory end-point. 

5NH 2 NH 2 H 2 + 2I 2 ► 4NH 2 NH 2 HI + 5H 2 + N 2 

Anhydrous hydrazine may be obtained by refluxing 100 per cent hydrazine 
hydrate (or the 95% material which has previously been allowed to stand 
overnight over 20% w/w of potassium hydroxide and filtered) with an equal 
weight of sodium hydroxide pellets for 2 hours and then distilling in a slow 
stream of nitrogen; b.p. 1 14-1 16 °C. Distillation in air may lead to an explosion. 

32. HYDRIODIC ACID 

This is supplied as an azeotrope with water (constant boiling hydriodic acid), 
b.p. 125.5-126.5 °C/760mmHg, d 1.70, which contains 55-57 per cent w/w HI 
(0.936 to 0.99 g HI per ml). Additional grades available contain 45 per cent w/w 
HI and 67 per cent w/w HI; the latter is stabilised by the addition of 0.03 per cent 
w/w of hypophosphorous acid. Once a bottle is opened the contents tend to 
deteriorate, becoming discoloured in a few days. This can be avoided by purging 
the container with nitrogen before resealing. 

The constant boiling azeotrope may be conveniently prepared in the 
laboratory, if required, by the following procedure. In a fume cupboard a 1.5- 
litre, three-necked flask is charged with a mixture of 480 g of iodine and 600 ml of 
water. The central socket is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer which leads 
almost to the bottom of the flask, and the smaller sockets respectively with a 
lead-in tube for hydrogen sulphide extending to well below the surface of the 
liquid and with an exit tube attached to an inverted funnel just dipping into 5 per 
cent sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is vigorously stirred and a stream 
of hydrogen sulphide (either from a freshly-charged Kipp's apparatus or from a 
cylinder of the gas) passed in as rapidly as it can be absorbed. After several hours 
the liquid assumes a yellow colour (sometimes it is almost colourless) and most 
of the sulphur sticks together in the form of a hard lump (1). The sulphur is 
removed by filtration through a funnel plugged with glass wool (or through a 

436 



SOLVENTS ANO REAGENTS 4.2 



sintered glass funnel), and the filtrate is boiled until the lead acetate paper test 
for hydrogen sulphide is negative. The solution is filtered again, if necessary. The 
hydriodic acid is then distilled from a 500-ml Claisen flask, and the fraction, b.p. 
125.5-126.5 °C/760mmHg, is collected. The yield of the constant boiling acid 
containing 57 per cent w/w HI is 785 g (90%). 

H 2 S + I 2 y 2HI + S 

Note. ( 1 ) The hard lump of sulphur remaining in the flask is best removed by boiling with 
concentrated nitric acid in the fume cupboard. 

33. HYDROBROMIC ACID 

This is supplied as an azeotrope with water (constant boiling hydrobromic acid), 
b.p. 126°C, d 1.46-1.49, which contains 47-48 per cent w/w HBr (0.695 to 
0.715 g HBr per ml). A grade of hydrobromic acid is available containing 60 per 
cent w/w HBr (1.007 g HBr per ml). 

34. HYDROCHLORIC ACID 

This is supplied in grades containing either 32 per cent w/w HC1 or 36 per cent 
w/w HC1 (0.371 g HC1 per ml and 0.424 g HC1 per ml respectively). 

35. HYDROFLUORIC ACID 

This is supplied as a 40 or 48 per cent solution. It is advisable to wear acid- 
resisting rubber gloves and protective goggles when handling hydrofluoric acid. 
The acid in contact with the skin produces extremely painful burns. In case of 
accident, the burned surface, which becomes white, is held under running water 
until the natural colour returns. A paste made from magnesium oxide and 
glycerine should be applied immediately; this is said to be helpful in preventing 
the burn becoming serious. A calcium-gluconate-containing antidote gel is 
available commercially as an immediate treatment for HF burns. Medical 
advice should be sought in the case of such burns. 

36. HYDROGEN 

Cylinders of compressed hydrogen (99.9998% purity) may be purchased or 
hired; the impurities comprise traces of nitrogen, oxygen, moisture and 
hydrocarbons. Less pure grades containing slightly larger amounts of con- 
taminating oxygen are however quite suitable for most purposes. Since 
hydrogen is chiefly employed for catalytic reductions and oxygen has, in general, 
no harmful effect upon the reduction, no purification is usually necessary. If, 
however, oxygen-free hydrogen is required, the oxygen may be removed by 
passage through Fieser's solution (see under 52. Nitrogen), and then through a 
wash bottle containing concentrated sulphuric acid to which some silver 
sulphate has been added; the latter will detect and remove any hydrogen 
sulphide that may have formed from the decomposition of Fieser's solution. 

37. HYDROGEN BROMIDE 

Hydrogen bromide is most conveniently prepared by the action of bromine 
upon tetrahydronaphthalene (tetralin) if the quantity required does not justify 
the purchase of a cylinder of the gas. 

C 10 H 12 + 4Br 2 y C 10 H 8 Br 4 + 4HBr 



437 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Only half of the added bromine is recovered as hydrogen bromide; a yield of 
about 45 per cent of hydrogen bromide is evolved computed on the weight of 
bromine taken. It is essential that the tetralin is pure and perfectly dry; it should 
therefore be allowed to stand over magnesium sulphate or anhydrous calcium 
sulphate for several hours, filtered and distilled under reduced pressure. The 
tetralin is placed in a round-bottomed flask fitted with a socket/cone adapter 
with T' connection and a dropping funnel (this may be of the pressure- 
equalising type (cf. Fig. 4.3)). Bromine is allowed to drop in from the funnel at a 
regular rate and the contents of the flask are gently swirled from time to time to 
ensure a steady evolution of hydrogen bromide. The traces of bromine carried 
over with the gas may be removed by allowing it to bubble through a Drechsel 
bottle charged with dry tetralin. A safety trap should always be interposed 
between the generating apparatus and the reaction vessel. 

A solution of hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid (45% w/v) is a convenient 
commercially available source, which is suitable for many preparations. 

38. HYDROGEN CHLORIDE 

Method 1 (from concentrated sulphuric acid and fused ammonium chloride). The 
most convenient procedure is to allow concentrated sulphuric acid to react with 
lumps of fused ammonium chloride in a Kipp's apparatus.* The gas may be 
dried by passage through a Drechsel bottle containing concentrated sulphuric 
acid; the latter should be followed by an empty Drechsel bottle as a precaution 
against 'sucking back' of the contents of the reaction vessel. 

Method 2 (from concentrated sulphuric acid and concentrated hydrochloric acid). 
The apparatus shown in Fig. 4.4 is employed. The upper funnel has a capacity of 
100 ml and has an appropriate length of capillary tubing fused to the outlet tube; 
the lower funnel has a capacity of 500 ml. When the capillary tube is filled with 
concentrated hydrochloric acid, there is sufficient hydrostatic pressure to force 
the hydrochloric acid into the sulphuric acid. The Drechsel bottle (A) contains 
concentrated sulphuric acid and the other acts as a safety trap; the whole 
apparatus must be mounted on a heavy stand. 

About 150 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid is placed in the larger funnel and 
100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in the smaller separatory funnel. The 
latter is raised from the adapter until the capillary tube is above the sulphuric 
acid, the capillary tube is carefully filled with concentrated hydrochloric acid, 
and the funnel is then lowered into the adapter socket. The rate of evolution of 
hydrogen chloride is controlled by regulation of the supply of hydrochloric 
acid: this will continue until a volume of hydrochloric acid equal to that of the 
concentrated sulphuric acid has been used. The diluted sulphuric acid should 
then be removed and the apparatus recharged. The yield is 31-33 g of hydrogen 
chloride per 100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid.

dangerous poison; all operations must be conducted in a fume cupboard provided 
with an efficient draught. The appropriate antidotes should be available. The 
apparatus used is similar to, but generally on a smaller scale than, that described 
for Hydrogen chloride, Method 2, in which the larger separating funnel is 
replaced by a round-bottomed flask of suitable size. A saturated solution of 
sodium cyanide (prepared by dissolving 50 g of commercial sodium cyanide, 
about 96% purity, in sufficient water to make 125 ml of solution) is added 1 cm 
below the surface of 125 ml of aqueous sulphuric acid (50% by volume) 
contained in the flask. Any residual hydrogen cyanide may be expelled by 
warming the flask on a water bath. The gas may be used directly, or may be 
collected in the liquid form (b.p. 26 °C) by passing through a glass coil, 4-5 cm 
bore and 50 cm long, surrounded by ice; a freezing mixture must not be used as 
this may result in solidification of the hydrogen cyanide (m.p. - 1 5 to - 14.5 °C) 
and consequent clogging of the apparatus. If the hydrogen cyanide is required 
anhydrous, it should be passed through a train of three large U-tubes filled with 
anhydrous calcium chloride, the tubes being immersed in a water bath 
maintained at 30-40 °C. 

40. HYDROGEN IODIDE 

This gas may be conveniently prepared by allowing a solution of two parts of 
iodine in one part of hydriodic acid (d 1.7) to drop on to excess of red 
phosphorus; the apparatus assembly employed could be of the general type 
illustrated in Fig. 4.3. The evolution of hydrogen iodide takes place in the cold; 
when the evolution of gas slackens considerably, the mixture should be gently 
warmed. 

41. HYDROGEN PEROXIDE 

Aqueous solutions of hydrogen peroxide having concentrations of 6, 12, 30, 50 
and 70 per cent w/v are available from most chemical suppliers. Higher 



439 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, i.e. 86 per cent w/v, are also available* 
('High Test Peroxide'). Care should be taken with all concentrations of 
hydrogen peroxide since explosions can occur on contact with organic material 
or with transition metals. 

Even the highly concentrated solutions of hydrogen peroxide ( &gt; 50%) may 
be handled safely providing certain basic precautions are observed (see also 
Expt 5.190, Note (1)). Firstly it is advisable to wear protective spectacles and 
rubber or plastic gloves. Since these high-strength solutions may ignite textiles, 
it is also strongly advised that a rubber or plastic apron be worn and that all 
operations involving transfer of such solutions be conducted in the fume 
cupboard, with the additional precaution that all the apparatus is sited in a 
plastic or aluminium tray containing water to catch accidental spillage. 
Inhalation of vapour arising from use at elevated temperatures from these 
higher concentrations may cause inflammation of the nose and throat, and 
exposure of the eyes leads to ulceration of the cornea. Solutions of hydrogen 
peroxide spilt on the skin should be washed off immediately with water, when 
only temporary discomfort will then be experienced. Indeed, a ready supply of 
water should be to hand to wash away splashes and leakages. f 

Frequently the strengths of solutions of hydrogen peroxide are quoted 
according to available oxygen content; thus 30 per cent w/v = 100 volumes, i.e. 
1 ml of the H 2 2 solution when fully decomposed by heat gives 100 ml of oxygen 
at s.t.p. This solution is approximately 8.82 m and hence 1 mol is contained in 
113 ml. The strength of an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide is conveni- 
ently measured by the volumetric procedure of titration with standard sodium 
thiosulphate of the iodine released when aqueous hydrogen peroxide is treated 
with acidified potassium iodide. 16 

42. HYDROGEN SULPHIDE 

This very poisonous gas should only be prepared and used in an efficient fume 
cupboard. It is usually generated from iron(n) sulphide and dilute hydrochloric 
acid (1:3) in a Kipp's apparatus; it should be washed with water to remove acid 
spray. The resulting hydrogen sulphide contains hydrogen because of the 
presence of free iron in commercial iron(n) sulphide. 

Pure hydrogen sulphide (99.6%) can be obtained commercially in cylinders. 

43. HYDROGEN TETRAFLUOBORATE (Fluoroboric acid) 

A purified grade of the reagent is available commercially containing 42 per cent 
w/w HBF 4 . It is usually more convenient to prepare the reagent before use; the 
details are given in Expt 6.77. Great caution should be exercised in handling this 
reagent. 

44. IODINE MONOCHLORIDE 

In a fume cupboard, pass dry chlorine gas into 127 g (0.5 mol) of iodine in a 
distilling flask until the weight has increased by 34.5 g (0.49 mol). The chlorine 
should be fed in via a glass frit located at or below the surface of the iodine while

solutions, and advise on the use of hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacids (Section 4.2.5(5, p. 455).

the flask is gently shaken. Distil the iodine chloride in an ordinary distillation 
apparatus; protect the receiver flask from the atmospheric moisture by a calcium 
chloride guard-tube. Collect the fraction, b.p. 97-105 °C; the yield is 140g (88%). 
Preserve the iodine monochloride in a dry, glass-stoppered bottle. Care should 
be taken when handling this compound since the liquid is corrosive and gives off 
a harmful vapour. If it should come into contact with the skin, an effective 
antidote is dilute hydrochloric acid (1:1). 

45. LEAD TETRA-ACETATE 

The reagent as supplied by manufacturers is moistened with glacial acetic acid 
to prevent hydrolytic decomposition. It may be prepared in the laboratory by 
warming lead oxide (red lead, Pb 3 4 ) with acetic acid in the presence of 
sufficient acetic anhydride to combine with the water formed. 

Pb 3 4 + 8Me-C0 2 H &gt; (Me-C0 2 ) 4 Pb + 2(Me-C0 2 ) 2 Pb + 4H 2 

The filtrate which contains lead acetate may be treated with chlorine: 

2(Me-C0 2 ) 2 Pb + Cl 2 &gt; (Me-C0 2 ) 4 Pb + PbCl 2 

and the resulting lead tetra-acetate separated from the accompanying lead 
chloride by recrystallisation from glacial acetic acid. 

A mixture of 550 g of glacial acetic acid and 185 g of acetic anhydride is placed 
in a 1 -litre, three-necked flask provided with a thermometer and a sealed stirrer 
unit. The liquid is vigorously stirred, heated to 55-60 °C and 300 g of dry red 
lead powder are added in portions of 15-20 g. A fresh addition is made only after 
the colour due to the preceding portion has largely disappeared. The 
temperature should not be allowed to rise above 65 °C. Towards the end it may 
be necessary to warm the flask cautiously to about 80 °C in order to complete 
the reaction. At the end of the reaction, the thick and somewhat dark solution is 
cooled, and the precipitated lead tetra-acetate is filtered off (the mother-liquor, 
A, is put aside) and washed with glacial acetic acid. The crude product, without 
being dried, is dissolved in hot glacial acetic acid containing a little acetic 
anhydride, the solution treated with a little decolourising carbon, filtered 
through a hot-water funnel and cooled. The colourless crystalline product is 
filtered off and dried in a vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide pellets. 
The yield is about 150g (78%). 

A further lOOg of lead tetra-acetate may be obtained from the mother-liquor 
(A) by returning it to the original flask, heating to about 75 °C with stirring, and 
passing through it a stream of dry chlorine. When the reaction is complete a few 
grams of decolourising carbon are added, the mixture is maintained at 75 °C for 
a few minutes, and the hot suspension is filtered with suction through a 
preheated Buchner funnel. The residue, consisting largely of lead chloride, is 
washed with hot glacial acetic acid. The filtrate, on cooling, deposits lead tetra- 
acetate in colourless needles; it is collected and dried as described above. 
Although contaminated with a little (&lt;5%) lead chloride the resulting lead 
tetra-acetate is satisfactory for most purposes; if required perfectly pure, it 
should be recrystallised as detailed above. 

46. LITHIUM 

CAUTION: See safety comments given for sodium (at 4.2.68) below. Lithium is 
somewhat less reactive than sodium but similar precautions should be observed. 

441 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Lithium is available as the dry solid packed under argon and in the form of shot 
or as a dispersion in liquid paraffin. A convenient method of preparing lithium 
from the rod form is as follows. Place a piece of lithium weighing about 3 g and 
slightly moist with paraffin oil on a dry surface (slate or tiles) and pound it with 
a clean hammer or 500-g weight into a thin sheet about 0.5 mm thick. Cut the 
sheet into thin strips about 2-3 mm wide and transfer it to a beaker containing 
anhydrous ether. Weigh out the quantity of lithium required under dry ether or 
paraffin oil. Dry each strip with filter paper, cut it by means of a pair of scissors 
into small pieces about 1 mm wide and allow the small pieces to fall directly into 
anhydrous ether in a reaction flask. The lithium thus retains its bright lustre. 

The lithium may also be pressed into wire of about 0.5 mm diameter; a rather 
sturdy press is necessary. The wire may be collected directly in sodium-dried 
ether. 

Lithium shot or dispersion in liquid paraffin can be exposed to air during 
handling without deterioration. It may be transferred by pouring through a 
wide-necked funnel. Small quantities of the dispersion may be destroyed by 
washing with water to allow the lithium metal to react with water. Larger 
quantities should be suspended in ether and treated in a fume cupboard with dry 
t-butyl alcohol. Hydrogen is liberated in this reaction. 

47. LITHIUM REAGENTS 

Alkyllithium reagents are used routinely in organic synthesis. They must be 
handled with care and protective clothing should be worn. Solutions of 
alkyllithiums are extremely flammable and may ignite on contact with moist 
air; they should therefore always be stored and handled in an inert atmosphere 
(argon or nitrogen). They are measured and transferred most conveniently by 
means of a hypodermic syringe or cannula (see Section 2.17.8, p. 122). A number 
of alkyllithiums are available commercially and the manufacturers' instructions 
for their handling should be followed carefully. The lithium reagent may be 
stored in the original container by placing a rubber septum on the neck and 
removing portions of the reagent as required by means of a hypodermic syringe; 
the volume of reagent removed should then be replaced by an equal volume of 
nitrogen similarly introduced by means of the syringe. An alternative means of 
transferring the reagent to a two- or three-necked flask for storage is as follows. 
Equip the necks with stopcocks for nitrogen inlet and outlet. The outlet should 
be of such a design that when it is open the needle of a hypodermic syringe can 
be passed through its centre into the flask. The transfer of the lithium reagent to 
the flask is then achieved by inserting into the neck of the reagent bottle a tight 
fitting rubber bung previously fitted with two glass tubes: a short inlet tube for 
connection to a supply of inert gas, and an exit tube which reaches to the bottom 
of the reagent bottle. The exit tube is connected by polythene tubing to the flask 
which has been previously dried and flushed with nitrogen. The reagent is then 
transferred by means of a slight positive pressure of inert gas. Whenever the 
reagent is removed a stream of inert gas should be passed through the flask 
before closing the stopcocks. Butyllithium can be stored for an extended period 
at room temperature under nitrogen. The concentration of the reagents should 
be checked periodically by one of the methods described below. 

Methyllithium is available commercially as a solution in diethyl ether. For 
some applications it is desirable to have methyllithium free of halide, and a 
method has been described for the preparation of such halide-free solutions. 17 

442 



SOLVENTS ADD REAGENTS 4.2 



Butyllithium is available as a solution in hexane, but can be prepared by a 
literature method if necessary. 18 

Ethyllithium may be prepared as follows. 19 Lithium dispersion (30% in 
mineral oil, 1% sodium, 18 g, 0.77 mol) is placed in a 500-ml three-necked round- 
bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirrer bar and kept under an argon 
atmosphere (see Section 2.17.8, p. 129). The lithium is washed with dry hexane 
(4 x 20 ml) and then 20 ml of dry hexane is added to the lithium and the 
temperature lowered to — 5 °C. A dry-ice condenser is attached and ethyl 
chloride (12 ml, 167mmol), which had been previously condensed in a separate 
two-necked pear-shaped flask (see Section 2.17.8, p. 126), is diluted with 20 ml of 
hexane and added via a cannula over a 3-hour period to the lithium maintained 
at — 5 °C. After the addition is complete, the mixture is allowed to come to room 
temperature very slowly (1). After stirring for 3 hours at room temperature the 
slurry takes on a purplish tint. Filtration through a sintered glass funnel is 
achieved via a cannula (maintaining an inert atmosphere - see Section 2.17.8, 
p. 134). The flask is rinsed with an additional 10 ml of dry ether. The resulting 
solution is colourless. The solvent is then removed by using a vacuum pump and 
a dry-ice trap. Ethyllithium is present as a clean white solid. The solvent is then 
replaced with 20 ml of dry ether. Titration (using the method described below) 
indicates the solution to be 3.80 m (79.8 mmol). The ethyllithium is then stored 
in the freezer and used within a few weeks. 

Note. (1 ) Even after the addition is complete and the mixture is at ambient temperature, 
the reaction may suddenly become exothermic. Hence, an ice bath should be kept ready 
at all times. 

Propyllithium may be prepared by the following method. 19 Lithium disper- 
sion (30% in mineral oil, 1% sodium, 14g, 0.6 mol) is placed in a 250-ml two- 
necked round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar, under an argon 
atmosphere (see Section 2.17.8, p. 129). The lithium is washed with dry hexane 
(5 x 20 ml) followed by addition of 1 5 ml of dry hexane. The slurry is cooled to 
— 10 °C and 1-chloropropane, distilled previously from calcium hydride, is 
placed in a pressure-equalising dropping funnel, dissolved in 30 ml of dry hexane, 
and added slowly over 1.5 hours while maintaining the temperature in the 
reaction vessel at — 10 °C. After addition is complete, the reaction is warmed to 
room temperature and stirring is continued for 5 hours. The solution becomes 
purplish-brown in colour. Filtration via a cannula through a sintered glass 
funnel (see Section 2.17.8, p. 131) affords a clear solution which is titrated (see 
below) and stored in the refrigerator. 

Estimation of solutions of alky llithium and Grignard reagents. These compounds 
may deteriorate with time and it is important for their use in synthesis to know 
the actual concentration of the reagent. 

Method 1. Use of2,2'-bipyridyl as indicator for the estimation of alkyllithiums. 20 
Alkyllithium reagents and Grignard reagents form coloured charge transfer 
complexes with certain aromatic nitrogen heterocycles such as 2,2'-bipyridyl, 
1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2'-biquinolyl. When the organometallic reagent is 
decomposed by compounds having an acidic hydrogen, in this case butan-2-ol, 
the colour disappears. The complexes thus form suitable indicators for the 
titration of the organometallic reagents. The titration is performed under an 
atmosphere of dry, oxygen-free nitrogen in a 50-ml, three-necked flask fitted 

443 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



with a nitrogen inlet and outlet and containing a glass-covered magnetic stirrer 
follower bar. The third neck is fitted with a bung (or rubber septum) through the 
centre of which passes the delivery tip of the burette; the tip should be well clear 
of the bottom of the bung. 

Dry the flask in the oven and allow to cool while passing a stream of nitrogen 
(fit a stopper in the third neck during this operation). Place about 2 mg of 2,2'- 
bipyridyl (1) and 10 ml of anhydrous benzene (CAUTION) in the flask and flush 
the flask with nitrogen for about 20 minutes. While maintaining a rapid flow of 
nitrogen, remove the nitrogen exit briefly and add a 5.00 ml aliquot portion (2) 
of the organometallic reagent to the solution. Titrate the resulting solution with 
a 1 m standard solution of butan-2-ol in p-xylene (3) until the colour of the 
charge transfer complex is discharged (4). 

1 mol butan-2-ol = 1 mol of organometallic reagent. 

Notes. (1) 1,10-Phenanthroline or 2,2'-biquinolyl may be used as alternative indicators. 
The colour of the complex is dependent upon the complexing agent. Thus butyllithium 
gives a greenish-yellow colour with 2,2'-biquinolyl, reddish-brown with 1,10-phenanthro- 
line and reddish-purple with 2,2'-bipyridyl. 

(2) Measure the aliquot portion of the organometallic reagent with a pipette which 
has been previously warmed in the oven and allowed to cool with a stream of nitrogen 
flowing through it. The use of a suction bulb is essential. 

(3) Depending on the anticipated concentration of the organometallic reagent, a more 
or a less concentrated solution may be required. Both the p-xylene and butan-2-ol should 
be freshly dried and distilled (Sections 4.1.4, p. 399 and 4.1.12, p. 402 respectively). 

(4) The solution remains clear throughout the titration since the lithium but-2-oxide 
which is formed in the reaction is soluble in the solvent mixture. 

Method 2. Use of 4-biphenylmethanol as indicator for the estimation of 
alkyllithiums. 21 This reagent gives a sharp colour change (colourless to orange- 
red) at the titration end -point. It is recrystallised from hexane/chloroform (4:1) 
and dried in vacuo before use. A typical procedure is as follows. In a dry 25 ml 
conical flask is placed 200-300 mg of 4-biphenylmethanol and a dry bar magnet. 
The flask is capped with a rubber septum and flushed with nitrogen before the 
introduction of 10 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran. From a graduated syringe is added 
dropwise the alkyllithium solution, until the appearance of the orange-red 
colour. The amount consumed contains 1 equivalent of alkyllithium relative to 
4-biphenylmethanol. 

Method 3. Use ofN-phenyl-1-naphthylaminefor the estimation of organolithium 
and organomagnesium reagents. 22 This reagent gives better-defined end-points 
than other reagents when alkylmagnesium halides are titrated. It can be kept in 
a nitrogen-flushed bottle for at least one year, but a solution in xylene gradually 
turns yellow-brown. A typical procedure is as follows. To a flame-dried 50 ml 
round-bottomed flask under nitrogen containing a magnetic stirring bar is 
added 2 ml of an ethereal solution of methylmagnesium bromide. This flask is 
then connected to a burette containing a xylene solution of JV -phenyl- 1- 
naphthylamine (0.005 m) and butan-2-ol (0.25 m) by means of a hypodermic 
needle connected to a Luer fitting on the burette. While the flask is vented to a 
mineral oil bubbler, the titrant is added dropwise to the stirred solution. A 
yellow-orange colour which initially forms continues to deepen until enough 
butan-2-ol had been added to react with all the amide and Grignard reagent. At 
this point the colour disappears and a cloudy white suspension forms. 

444 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



It is sometimes desirable to detect the presence of an alkyllithium in a 
reaction mixture. For this purpose a few milligrams of 2,2'-bipyridyl or 
biphenylmethanol can be added to the reaction mixture as an indicator. A 
reddish or reddish-purple coloration indicates the presence of an alkyllithium. 

48. MANGANESE DIOXIDE 

The principal organic use for manganese dioxide is for the selective oxidation of 
allylic and benzylic primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding 
carbonyl compounds. The activity of the reagent varies with its method of 
preparation; material of good activity may be obtained by oxidising 
manganese(n) ions with an excess of permanganate under alkaline conditions*: 

3Mn 2 ® + 2MnO? + 40H -&gt; 5Mn0 2 + 2H 2 

Add simultaneously during 1 hour (a) a solution of 223 g (1 mol) of 
manganese(n) sulphate tetrahydrate in 300 ml of water, and (b) 240 ml (2.5 mol) 
of 40 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to a hot stirred solution of 
190g (1.2 mol) of potassium permanganate in 1200 ml of water. Continue 
stirring for a further 1 hour, isolate the fine brown precipitate of manganese 
dioxide (preferably by centrifugation) and wash it thoroughly with water until 
the washings are colourless. Dry the product at 100-120 °C and grind finely. 
Alternatively remove as much of the wash-water as possible by prolonged 
suction and activate the damp cake (in 25 g portions) by removing most of the 
remaining water by azeotropic distillation with 150 ml of benzene 24 
(CAUTION). 

Some commercial samples of precipitated manganese dioxide may be active 
enough for use directly in an oxidation process. To assess the activity of a sample 
of manganese dioxide, dissolve 0.25 g of pure cinnamyl alcohol in 50 ml of dry 
light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C) and shake the solution at room temperature for 2 
hours with 2g of the sample of manganese dioxide (previously dried over 
phosphoric oxide). Filter, remove the solvent by evaporation and treat the 
residue with an excess of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine sulphate in methanolf 
(Section 9.6.13, p. 1257). Collect the cinnamaldehyde 2,4-dinitrophenyl- 
hydrazone and crystallise it from ethyl acetate. An active dioxide should give a 
yield of the derivative, m.p. 255 °C (decomp.), in excess of 0.35 g (60%). 

49. METAL HYDRIDES 

A large number of metal hydrides are now available to the organic chemist. They 
vary in the range of their application, ease of handling and cost. They are often 
the reagent of choice for the reduction of a wide range of organic functional 
groups. 25 Deuterium analogues of several of the complex hydrides discussed 
below are also available commercially. They allow the introduction of a 
deuterium atom into organic compounds at known positions, giving com- 
pounds which are of value in the investigation of metabolic pathways and 
reaction mechanisms. 

Lithium aluminium hydride is a powerful reducing agent which will reduce a 
wide range of functional groups rapidly. A typical example, the reduction of an

4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ester to an alcohol, is described in Expt 5.38. This reactivity makes it a very 
useful reagent for the organic chemist, but limits its use for selective reductions 
in a molecule containing more than one functional group. The reagent is usually 
supplied in powdered form contained in individual plastic bags sealed within a 
metal can. It is also available as a solution in ether, diglyme, tetrahydrofuran, or 
toluene, in the last case as the THF complex. Lithium aluminium hydride reacts 
violently with water, liberating hydrogen, and any contact with even traces of 
moisture must be avoided since the heat of reaction which ensues may cause the 
material to ignite.* Great caution should therefore be employed in handling the 
reagent, taking particular care not to inhale the powder during weighing or 
transfer operations, etc. Residual powdered reagent may be safely destroyed by 
suspending it in light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) contained in a vessel sited 
behind a safety screen, carefully adding dropwise ethyl acetate until apparent 
reaction ceases, and standing the mixture overnight. The procedure should be 
repeated using first ethanol and then water. Finally, the aqueous layer may be 
separated and rinsed down the drain and the organic layer placed in the 
'recovery' bottle. All operations involving the reagent should be conducted behind 
a safety screen in a fume cupboard; plastic gloves should be worn. 

Lithium aluminium hydride reductions are usually carried out in a suitable 
ethereal solvent, such as rigorously dried diethyl ether (Section 4.1.75, p. 404) or 
tetrahydrofuran (Section 4.1.79, p. 406); the solubility of the reagent is 25-30g 
and 13 g per 1000 g of solvent respectively. These solutions invariably contain a 
voluminous insoluble residue arising from impurities which may be formed by 
the action of moisture on the hydride during handling operations; this however 
constitutes not more than 1 per cent of the added reagent, and does not 
normally interfere with the subsequent reduction processes. In those cases which 
require the use of accurately known quantities of hydride it is necessary to 
prepare a standardised ethereal solution of the reagent. An ethereal solution 
(about 0.5 m) may be prepared by heating under reflux for 1 hour in an 
atmosphere of nitrogen about 20 g of lithium aluminium hydride with 1 litre of 
rigorously dried ether in a 2-litre, round-bottomed flask fitted with a double 
surface reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube. The solution is 
cooled and filtered through a sintered glass Buchner funnel previously rinsed 
with dried ether and the residue is washed with a small portion of dried ether. 
The filtrate is transferred to the reservoir of a suitable automatic burette 
previously flushed with nitrogen from which aliquot portions may be dispensed 
for standardisation, and for use in subsequent reductions. Care should be 
exercised in the treatment of the residue in the Buchner funnel; it is safely 
destroyed by adding it to ethyl acetate contained in a beaker; the funnel is then 
rinsed with further quantities of ethyl acetate. The other vessels (Buchner flask, 
round-bottomed flask, etc.) are best rinsed with ethanol. 

To standardise the ethereal solution of lithium aluminium hydride, an aliquot 
portion is added to an excess of a standardised solution of iodine in benzene 
(CAUTION), when the following reaction ensues: 

2I 2 + LiAlH 4 &gt; LiAlI 4 + 2H 2 

Unreacted iodine is then titrated with standard sodium thiosulphate solution. 

* Solid lithium aluminium hydride fires should only be extinguished using dry sand or powdered 
limestone. Water or carbon dioxide or chemically filled extinguishers must never be used.

Add 5 ml of an approximately 0.5 m ethereal solution of lithium aluminium 
hydride to 50 ml of a standardised approximately 0.2 m iodine solution in 
benzene. Shake the solution gently and allow to stand for 5 minutes, add 50 ml 
of distilled water followed by about 2 ml of glacial acetic acid. Titrate the excess 
of iodine with a standardised 0.2 m solution of sodium thiosulphate using starch 
solution in the final stages to determine the end-point.

0.03795 g LiAlH 4 = 0.507 68 g iodine 

The experimental conditions for reductions using lithium aluminium hydride 
are similar to those for the Grignard reaction. For compounds which are readily 
soluble in ether, a solution of the compound in dry ether is added to an ethereal 
solution of lithium aluminium hydride (slight excess) at such a rate that the 
reaction mixture boils gently. For compounds which are slightly or sparingly 
soluble in ether, a Soxhlet apparatus (Fig. 2.96) is inserted between the reaction 
flask and the reflux condenser and the compound is placed in the Soxhlet 
thimble. When the reduction is complete, the excess of reagent is decomposed by 
the cautious addition of moist ether, or an ethanol-ether mixture or by the 
dropwise addition of cold water with vigorous stirring; when water is used, it is 
desirable to employ a large flask because of the foaming which takes place. On 
the whole it is best to employ ethyl acetate, as its reduction product (ethanol) 
does not interfere in the subsequent isolation and no hydrogen is evolved. The 
reaction mixture is then poured gradually into excess of ice-cold dilute sulphuric 
acid to decompose the complex aluminium compounds and to dissolve the 
precipitated aluminium hydroxide; the product is usually in the ethereal layer 
but, if it is water-soluble, it must be isolated from the aqueous solution. For 
bases, after extraction of any neutral or acidic products, the solution is rendered 
alkaline with 10 m sodium hydroxide and the whole (including the precipitated 
aluminium hydroxide) is extracted with ether. As an alternative decomposition 
procedure in this latter case, and also for use with products which are acid- 
sensitive, the excess of lithium aluminium hydride is best decomposed by the 
careful dropwise addition of just sufficient water to produce a granular 
precipitate of lithium aluminate (LiA10 2 ) which is readily filterable. An excess 
of water produces a gelatinous precipitate of aluminium hydroxide and should 
be avoided. 

Sodium borohydride is a milder reducing agent than lithium aluminium 
hydride. Among the carbonyl compounds, it normally only reduces aldehydes 
and ketones readily; see Section 5.4.1, p. 519, for further discussion. Examples of 
reductions by sodium borohydride which illustrate various aspects of selectivity 
are described in Expts 5.31 (chloral and m-nitrobenzaldehyde), 5.1 17 (carbohy- 
drates), 6.50(nitro to amino group) and 6.58 (reduction of a Schiff base). The use 
of sodium borohydride as a hydrogen source for small-scale hydrogenations is 
described in Section 2.17.1, p. 87. Sodium borohydride is available as the solid 
reagent or as a solution in diglyme, triglyme, or aqueous sodium hydroxide. It is 
also available on alumina or silica gel as solid supports. Unlike lithium 
aluminium hydride, sodium borohydride is insoluble in ether (but soluble in 
dioxane) and is normally used as a reducing agent in aqueous or aqueous 
alcoholic solution. The stability of the aqueous solution is increased by the 
addition of alkali; indeed, a stabilised 12 per cent solution of sodium 

447 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



borohydride in 43 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide is available commercially 
as Sodium Borohydride — S WS (Aldrich). 

The hydride is rather readily decomposed by methanol or ethanol; isopropyl 
alcohol and t-butyl alcohol are the preferred alcoholic solvents. 

An alkaline borohydride solution may be assayed by addition of excess 
standard potassium iodate solution leading to its decomposition in accordance 
with the equation: 

3§H 4 + 4IO? »■ 4I e + 3H 2 BO? + 3H 2 

Unreacted potassium iodate is then determined by addition of potassium iodide 
followed by acidification when the iodine liberated is estimated by titration with 
standard sodium thiosulphate solution. 

Lithium borohydride is intermediate in activity as a reducing agent between 
lithium aluminium hydride and sodium borohydride. In addition to the 
reduction of aldehydes and ketones it will readily reduce esters to alcohols. It 
can be prepared in situ by the addition of an equivalent quantity of lithium 
chloride to a 1m solution of sodium borohydride in diglyme. Lithium 
borohydride should be handled with as much caution as lithium aluminum 
hydride. It may react rapidly and violently with water; contact with skin and 
clothing should be avoided. 

Lithium triethylborohydride (Super-Hydride) is a much more powerful 
reducing agent than lithium aluminium hydride. It is useful for the reductive 
dehalogenation of alkyl halides, but unlike lithium aluminium hydride does not 
affect aryl halides. It is available as solution in tetrahydrofuran in sealed 
containers under nitrogen. The solutions are flammable and moisture sensitive 
and should be handled with the same precautions as are taken with other 
organometallic reagents (see Section 4.2.47, p. 442). 

Sodium cyanoborohydride is a very mild reducing agent. The electron 
withdrawing nature of the nitrile group in the cyanoborohydride anion reduces 
the tendency to donate hydride ion and therefore sodium cyanoborohydride is a 
milder reducing agent than sodium borohydride. It also has the particular 
advantage that it is stable in mildly acid solutions (down to pH 3). It is soluble in 
tetrahydrofuran, methanol, water and in some dipolar aprotic solvents such as 
dimethylformamide, but insoluble in hydrocarbons. It is particularly useful for 
reductive amination and for the reduction of tosylhydrazones used in the 
conversion of carbonyl to methylene groups. The commercially available 
material is suitable for most purposes. If necessary, it can be prepared by the 
following method. 27 To a rapidly stirred slurry of sodium borohydride (80.2 g, 
2.09 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (1000 ml) in a 2-litre flask is added a solution of 
hydrogen cyanide in tetrahydrofuran (294 g containing 58.8 g of hydrogen 
cyanide) at 25 °C (CAUTION: See Section 4.2.39, p. 438 for precautions in 
handling hydrogen cyanide). Evolution of hydrogen occurs slowly during the 
addition. Following the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hour at 
25 °C and then heated at reflux until hydrogen evolution has ceased. Filtration 
followed by vacuum removal of tetrahydrofuran gives white, solid sodium 
cyanoborohydride; yield 120g (91%). The product prepared by this method 
does not require purification for most uses. If further purification of this or the 
commercial product is required it can be accomplished by dissolving the sodium 
cyanoborohydride in tetrahydrofuran (20% w/v), filtering and reprecipitating by 

448 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



the addition of a four-fold volume of dichloromethane. Sodium cyanoborohy- 
dride is a white amorphous powder, m.p. 240-242 °C (decomp.). Contact with 
air should be kept to a minimum because the compound is very hygroscopic. 

Bis(triphenylphosphine)copper(i) tetrahydroborate [(Ph 3 P) 2 CuBH 4 ] has 
found use as a reagent for the reduction of aliphatic and aromatic acid chlor- 
ides to the corresponding aldehyde, and is an alternative to the standard 
Rosenmund procedure. This is illustrated in Expt 6.120. The reagent may be 
prepared by either of the following two methods; both preparations should be 
conducted in an efficient fume cupboard as hydrogen is evolved. 

(a) 28 Copper(i) chloride (1 g, 0.01 mol) is dissolved in 500 ml of chloroform 
(CAUTION) containing 12 g of triphenylphosphine. A solution of sodium 
borohydride (0.76 g, 0.02 mol) in 100 ml of 95 per cent ethanol is added 
dropwise. After stirring for an hour, the solution is filtered and concentrated 
using a rotatory evaporator to give a white crystalline precipitate of 
(Ph 3 P) 2 CuBH 4 , which is collected by filtration and washed with ethanol and 
water. The air-dried product weighs 6g (100%), m.p. 175 °C (decomp.). 

(b) 29 Hydrated copper(n) sulphate (16g, 64mmol) is stirred in a solution of 
triphenylphosphine (54 g, 200mmol) in ethanol (1400 ml) to give after 1 hour, a 
pale-green solution. Finely powdered sodium borohydride (12 g, 320mmol) is 
added with stirring; hydrogen is evolved and a white precipitate formed. After 1 
hour, the crude product is collected by filtration and dissolved in chloroform 
(400 ml) (CAUTION). The reaction mixture is filtered and ethanol (800 ml) 
added to the filtrate. The precipitate is collected by filtration and washed with 
ethanol and ether to give bis(triphenylphosphine)copper(i) tetrahydroborate, 
32 g, 53mmol (83% based on copper sulphate) as white needles, m.p. 174-6°C. 

Sodium hydride is a white, crystalline, free-flowing powder, which must be 
kept in air-tight containers for protection against moisture and oxygen. If 
exposed to the air unduly, traces of sodium hydroxide formed on the surface 
render the material hygroscopic; rapid absorption of moisture may then take 
place, and the heat generated by the reaction with water may suffice to ignite the 
solid. Great care must be taken therefore in handling sodium hydride and all 
operations involving the manipulation of the dry solid material should be 
conducted in a manipulator glove box in an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. Sodium 
hydride residues are best destroyed by careful treatment with ethyl acetate 
[Section 2.3.2, p. 41]. 

For most purposes it is much more convenient to use the commercially 
available 55-60 per cent dispersion of the hydride in white mineral oil, which 
being less susceptible to atmospheric moisture is much less hazardous. For 
reactions which are performed in those organic solvents in which the oil is 
soluble (e.g. light petroleum, benzene, toluene, etc.) the presence of the mineral 
oil does not impair the reactivity of the hydride and the dispersion may be used 
directly. If removal of the oil prior to reaction is necessary, as for example in 
those cases where its separation from the reaction product may prove difficult, 
this can be accomplished by washing the dispersion by decantation with a 
rigorously dried solvent (e.g. light petroleum), the operation being conducted in 
a manipulator glove box, or in the apparatus described in Section 2.17.8, p. 138. 

Potassium hydride is more basic and more reactive than sodium hydride. It is 
available commercially as a 35 per cent dispersion in mineral oil. The 
precautions described above for the handling of sodium hydride must also be 
adopted with potassium hydride, but because of its greater reactivity greater 



449 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



care needs to be taken. In particular care needs to be taken to ensure that any 
potassium hydride suspended in organic solvent is not allowed to come into 
contact with water as a fire will result. It is recommended that the organic layers 
from the washing of potassium hydride, for example in the removal of the 
mineral oil, are treated with one of the lower alcohols such as butanol to destroy 
any small particles of potassium hydride. Similar precautions need to be taken 
with any glassware, spatulas or other equipment which might have come into 
contact with potassium hydride. The mineral oil is soluble in a range of organic 
solvents (e.g. ether, hexane, toluene, dibutyl ether) and these can be used as 
reaction solvents without affecting the activity of the reagent. In the absence of 
the protective oil potassium hydride should be protected from air and moisture. 

Diisobutylaluminium hydride is a useful agent for various homogeneous 
reductions such as alkynes to alkenes, esters or nitriles to aldehydes. It is 
available commercially as the neat reagent and as a solution in several different 
solvents (hexane, dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran, etc.). The neat reagent is a 
liquid and is supplied in metal cylinders. It is pyrophoric and highly reactive and 
therefore must be handled with great care. The molar solutions in organic 
solvents are more stable and easier to handle provided that the normal 
precautions are taken for working with air-sensitive compounds (Section 2.17.8, 
p. 120). They must all be handled in an atmosphere free from oxygen and water. 
Commonly used solvents for diisobutylaluminium hydride are dichlorometh- 
ane, diglyme, dioxane and tetrahydrofuran. Even when the substrate is not 
completely soluble in these solvents successful reductions can be accomplished. 

Tri-n-butyltin hydride is a useful reducing agent for the conversion of alkyl 
halides to hydrocarbons. It is moisture sensitive and has an irritant vapour. It is 
a colourless liquid which can be kept for some time providing that moisture is 
excluded. It is available commercially in sealed containers under nitrogen but 
can be prepared by the following method if required. 30 A solution of lithium 
aluminium hydride (4.75 g, 0.125 mol) in 400 ml of anhydrous ether is placed in a 
three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 
condenser and a pressure-equalising dropping funnel containing 100 g 
(0.308 mol) of tributyltin chloride. The system is flushed with nitrogen and then 
tributyltin chloride is added dropwise at a rate which maintains a gentle reflux 
of the ether. The resulting mixture is then stirred for 7 hours. Careful addition of 
water to the cooled mixture destroys the excess lithium aluminium hydride. The 
ether solution is decanted, washed with three 100-ml portions of water and dried 
over calcium sulphate. Evaporation of the solvent and distillation under vacuum 
give 68 g (78%) of tributyltin hydride (b.p. 68-69 °C/0.3 mmHg, n u 25 1.4688) 
which is kept under argon. 

50. NICKEL 

The introduction by Raney (1927) of a new form of catalyst (the Raney nickel 
catalyst) with enhanced activity for hydrogenation at low pressures and 
temperatures in comparison with the usual form of nickel catalyst as employed 
by Sabatier and Senderens opened up a new field of controlled catalytic 
hydrogenation. A special alloy, prepared essentially by the fusion of approxi- 
mately equal parts of aluminium and nickel at 1200-1 500 °C, is treated with 
alkali which dissolves the aluminium and leaves the nickel as a finely-divided 
black suspension. The catalyst is thoroughly washed to free it from alkali, is 
stored under absolute ethanol in an air-free container and is measured in the 



450 



SOLVENTS AMD REAGENTS 4.2 



form of the suspension; it must be handled under a solvent at all times as it is 
highly pyrophoric. 

The advantages of this catalyst are that it is cheaper and less delicate than 
platinium, fairly large quantities of organic substrate may be hydrogenated and 
the process is reasonably rapid. The following method gives a catalyst of 
moderate activity ( W2 Raney nickel). 

Place a solution of 190 g of sodium hydroxide in 750 ml of water in a 2-litre 
beaker equipped with an efficient stirrer (1), cool in an ice bath to 10 °C and add 
1 50 g of nickel-aluminium alloy in small portions, with stirring, at such a rate 
that the temperature does not rise above 25 °C. If excessive foaming is 
encountered, add 1 ml of octan- 1 -ol. When all the alloy has been introduced 
(about 2 hours), stop the stirrer, remove the beaker from the ice bath and allow 
the contents to attain room temperature. When the evolution of hydrogen 
becomes slow, heat the reaction mixture gradually (2) on a water bath, until the 
evolution again becomes slow (about 8-12 hours); add distilled water to restore 
the original volume, stir the mixture, allow to settle and decant the supernatant 
liquid. Transfer the nickel to a stoppered graduated cylinder with the aid of 
distilled water, and decant the water again. Add a solution of 25 g of sodium 
hydroxide in 250 ml of water, shake to disperse the catalyst thoroughly, allow to 
settle and decant the alkali solution. Wash the nickel by suspension in distilled 
water and decantation until the washings are neutral to litmus, then ten times 
more to remove the alkali completely (25-40 washings are required) (3). Repeat 
the washing process three times with 100 ml of rectified spirit (95% ethanol) and 
three times with absolute ethanol. Store the catalyst in bottles which are 
completely filled with absolute ethanol and tightly stoppered; the product is 
highly pyrophoric and must be kept under liquid at all times. The Raney nickel 
contained in this suspension weights about 75 g. 

In the practical applications of Raney nickel it is more convenient to measure 
the catalyst than to weigh it. The product, prepared as above, contains about 
0.6 g of the catalyst per millilitre of settled material: a level teaspoonful is about 
3 g of nickel. 

Notes. (1) The stirrer should be provided with a motor which will not ignite the 
hydrogen - an induction motor or an air stirrer is suitable. The stirrer itself may be of 
glass, Monel metal or stainless steel (cf. Fig. 2.48). 

(2) The heating should not be too rapid initially or the solution may froth over. 

(3) The number of washings may be reduced to about twenty, if time is allowed for 
diffusion of the alkali from the surface of the catalyst into the surrounding wash-water. 
Use 750ml of water in each washing, allow diffusion to proceed for 3-10 minutes, stir 
again and decant the supernatant liquid as soon as the catalyst settles to the bottom. 

51. NITRIC ACID 

The commercial concentrated acid, d 1 .42, is a constant boiling azeotrope with 
water, b.p. 120.5 °C/760mmHg, containing about 70 per cent w/w HN0 3 
(0.989 g HN0 3 per ml). Colourless concentrated acid may be obtained free of 
coloured impurities (due to oxides of nitrogen or to nitrous acid) by warming to 
about 60 °C and passing in a stream of dust-free nitrogen; the addition of a little 
urea considerably accelerates the process. 

2HN0 2 + (NH 2 ) 2 CO &gt; C0 2 + 2N 2 + 3H 2 

The so-called fuming nitric acid, d 1.5, contains about 95 per cent w/w HNO3 

451 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(1.41 9 g HN0 3 per ml) and is available commercially; it has a yellow colour due 
to the presence of oxides of nitrogen which may be removed as detailed above. 
The acid may be prepared by distilling a mixture of equal volumes of 
concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid in a distillation 
assembly which incorporates a splash-head fitment to the distillation flask to act 
as a trap for acid spray. The volume of distillate collected should be slightly less 
than one-half of concentrated nitric acid originally used. 

52. NITROGEN 

Cylinders of compressed nitrogen may be purchased or hired. The gas may 
contain traces of oxygen which may be removed, if necessary, by passage either 
through an alkaline solution of pyrogallol (1 5 g of pyrogallol dissolved in 100 ml 
of 50% sodium hydroxide solution) or through Fieser's solution, which consists 
of an alkaline solution of sodium dithionite to which sodium anthraquinone-2- 
sulphonate is added. Fieser's solution is prepared by dissolving 20 g of potassium 
hydroxide in 100 ml of water, and adding 2g of sodium anthraquinone-2- 
sulphonate and 15 g of commercial sodium dithionite (c. 85%) to the warm 
solution and stirring until dissolved: the blood-red solution is ready for use 
when it has cooled to room temperature, and will absorb about 750 ml of 
oxygen. The exhaustion of this solution is indicated by the change in colour to 
dull-red or brown, or when a precipitate appears. Oxygen-free nitrogen in 
cylinders is available commercially, but is, of course, more expensive than the 
normal commercial compressed gas. 

53. OSMIUM TETROXIDE (Osmic acid) 

This is supplied as the solid in sealed ampoules or as a solution in water or 2- 
methylpropan-2-ol (t-butyl alcohol). It must be handled in a fume cupboard. It 
is extremely irritating and toxic and constitutes a severe eye injury hazard. The 
solution in t-butyl alcohol (Expt 5.47) must be prepared and dispensed in an 
efficient fume cupboard, with the added protection of gloves and goggles. This 
solution is reasonably stable (e.g. the decomposition after one month is about 
20%), provided that no 2-methylprop- 1 -ene arising from the t-butyl alcohol is 
present as an impurity. Formation of black coloidal osmium, which can catalyse 
the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, for example in the hydroxylation of 
alkenes, is rapid. 

54. PALLADIUM CATALYSTS 

To prepare palladium on charcoal (5% Pd), heat a solution of 1.7 g of palladium 
chloride (1) in 1.7 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 20 ml of water on a 
water bath for 2 hours or until solution is complete, and add this to a solution of 
30 g of sodium acetate trihydrate in 200 ml of water contained in a 500-ml 
hydrogenation flask. Add 20 g of acid-washed activated charcoal (2) and 
hydrogenate in an atmospheric hydrogenation apparatus (Fig. 2.63(a)) until 
absorption ceases. Collect the catalyst on a Buchner funnel and wash it with five 
100 ml portions of water and suck as dry as possbile. Dry the catalyst at room 
temperature (3) over potassium hydroxide pellets or anhydrous calcium 
chloride in a vacuum desiccator. Powder the catalyst (about 20 g) and store in a 
tightly stoppered bottle. 

For palladium on charcoal (30% Pd) prepare a solution of 8.25 g of palladium 
chloride (1) in 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and dilute with 50 ml of 

452 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



distilled water. Cool the solution in an ice-salt bath and add 50 ml of 40 per cent 
formaldehyde solution and 1 1 g of acid-washed activated charcoal (2). Stir the 
mixture mechanically and add a solution of 50 g of potassium hydroxide in 50 ml 
of water, keeping the temperature below 5 °C. When the addition is complete, 
raise the temperature to 60 °C for 1 5 minutes. Wash the catalyst thoroughly by 
decantation with water and finally with dilute acetic acid, collect on a suction 
filter and wash with water until free from chloride or alkali. Dry at 100 °C and 
store in a desiccator. 

Palladium black is prepared as follows. Dissolve 5 g of palladium chloride in 
30 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and dilute with 80 ml of water; cool in 
an ice-salt bath and add 35 ml of 40 per cent formaldehyde solution. Add a cold 
solution of 35 g of potassium hydroxide in 35 ml of water drop wise during 30 
minutes to the vigorously stirred palladium solution. Warm to 60 °C for 30 
minutes and then wash the palladium precipitate six times by decantation with 
water. Filter on a sintered crucible, wash with 1 litre of water and suck dry and 
transfer to a desiccator charged with silica gel. The yield is 3.1 g. 

Palladium on barium sulphate (5% Pd) is prepared as follows. Dissolve 4. 1 g of 
palladium chloride (1) in 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and dilute 
with 25 ml of water. Add all at once 60 ml of 3 m sulphuric acid to a rapidly 
stirred, hot (80 °C) solution of 63.1 g of barium hydroxide octahydrate in 600 ml 
of water contained in a 2-litre beaker. Add more 3 m sulphuric acid to render the 
suspension just acid to litmus. Introduce the palladium chloride solution and 
4 ml of 40 per cent formaldehyde solution into the hot mechanically-stirred 
suspension of barium sulphate. Render the suspension slightly alkaline with 30 
per cent sodium hydroxide solution, continue the stirring for 5 minutes longer 
and allow the catalyst to settle. Decant the clear supernatant liquid, replace it by 
water and resuspend the catalyst. Wash the catalyst by decantation 8-10 times 
and then collect it on a medium-porosity sintered glass funnel, wash it with five 
25 ml portions of water and suck as dry as possible. Dry the funnel and contents 
at 80 °C, powder the catalyst (48 g) and store it in a tightly stoppered bottle. 

For use in the Rosenmund reduction (Expt 6.120) the catalyst is moderated 
by the addition of the appropriate quantity of a quinoline-sulphur poison 
prepared in the following manner. Heat under reflux 1 g of sulphur with 6g of 
quinoline for 5 hours and dilute the resulting brown liquid to 70 ml with xylene 
which has been purified by distillation over anhydrous aluminium chloride. 
Thiourea (about 20% by weight of the palladium-barium sulphate catalyst) may 
also be used as a catalyst poison. 

The preparation of Lindlar's catalyst (palladium on calcium carbonate 
moderated by treating with lead acetate and quinoline) 3 ! has been described in 
detail; it is used for effecting the partial reduction of an acetylenic bond to an 
olefin. 

Where it is advantageous to maintain the neutrality of the hydrogenation 
mixture, palladium on barium carbonate catalyst is recommended. For the 
preparation of this catalyst the experimental details noted above for the barium 
sulphate based catalyst are used, but the barium hydroxide and sulphuric acid 
are replaced by 46.5 g of precipitated barium carbonate and the volume of 
hydrochloric acid is reduced to 4.1 ml. 

For palladium hydroxide on calcium carbonate mix hot solutions of 55 g of 
anhydrous calcium chloride and 53 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate each 
dissolved in 150 ml of distilled water. Filter the resulting precipitate of calcium 



453 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



carbonate, wash it well with water and suspend it in 200 ml of distilled water. 
Dissolve 1 g of palladium chloride in 2.4 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
and dilute with 30 ml of distilled water. Adjust the pH of the solution (4) to 4.0- 
4.5 by the cautious addition with stirring of 3 m sodium hydroxide solution. No 
permanent precipitate should be obtained at this stage. Add this solution to the 
calcium carbonate suspension, warm to 80 °C with stirring until conversion to 
the insoluble palladium hydroxide is complete, i.e. until the supernatant liquors 
are colourless. Wash several times with distilled water by decantation, filter with 
suction and wash sparingly with distilled water until the washings are chloride 
free. Dry over silica gel in a vacuum desiccator and preserve in a tightly 
stoppered bottle. 

Notes. ( 1 ) Alternatively, the equivalent quantity of palladium chloride dihydrate may be 
used. 

(2) Any of the commercial forms of activated carbon ('Norit', 'Darco', etc.) may be 
employed; the carbon should be heated on a steam bath with 10 per cent nitric acid for 
2-3 hours, washed free from acid with water and dried at 100-1 10 °C before use. 

(3) Heating may cause ignition of the carbon. 

(4) The pH adjustment is most conveniently followed with the aid of a pH meter. 

55. PERIODIC ACID 

Periodic acid has a selective oxidising action upon compounds having two 
hydroxyl groups or a hydroxyl and an amino group attached to adjacent carbon 
atoms, which is characterised by the cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond 
(Malaprade reaction): 

R-CH(OH)-CH{OH)-R' + HI0 4 &gt; R-CHO + R'-CHO + HI0 3 + H 2 

RCH(OH)-CH(NH 2 )-R' + HI0 4 &gt; R-CHO + R'-CHO + HI0 3 + NH 3 

No oxidation occurs unless the hydroxyl groups or a hydroxyl and an amino 
group are attached to adjacent carbon atoms, hence the reaction may be 
employed for testing for the presence of contiguous hydroxyl groups (e.g. 1,2- 
diols) and hydroxyl and amino groups. Carbonyl compounds in which the 
carbonyl group is contiguous to a hydroxyl group or a second carbonyl group 
are also oxidised, e.g., a-hydroxy-aldehydes or -ketones, 1,2-diketones and a- 
hydroxy acids: 

R-CH(OH)-CO-R' + HI0 4 ► R-CHO + R'-C0 2 H + HI0 3 

R-CO-CO-R' + HI0 4 + H 2 &gt; R-C0 2 H + R'C0 2 H + HI0 3 

The oxidation may proceed through the hydrated form of the carbonyl 
group &gt; CH(OH) 2 . The rate of oxidation is 1,2-glycols &gt; a-hydroxy aldehydes 
&gt; a-hydroxy ketones &gt; a-hydroxy acids. 

Periodic acid is available in two grades, one contains a minimum of 95 per 
cent w/w HI0 4 .2H 2 0, the other is an aqueous solution of periodic acid 
containing 50 per cent w/w HI0 4 .2H 2 0. 

Sodium periodate, and less frequently potassium periodate, are employed in 
oxidations which are to be carried out within the pH range 3-5. Sodium 
metaperiodate (NaI0 4 ) has a solubility in water of c. 0.07 g per ml; the addition 
of alkali leads to the precipitation of the far less soluble sodium paraperiodate 
(Na 2 H 3 I0 6 , disodium trihydrogen orthoperiodate, water solubility c. 0.20%). 
Sodium paraperiodate is available commercially and may be converted into the 

454 



SOLVENTS ANO REAGENTS 4.2 



metaperiodate salt by dissolving 100 parts in a mixture of 150 parts of water and 
45 parts of concentrated nitric acid, warming to effect solution, filtering through 
a sintered glass funnel if necessary, and allowing the sodium metaperiodate to 
crystallise overnight at room temperature. Potassium metaperiodate has a lower 
solubility in water than sodium metaperiodate. 

In cases where the organic substrate is insoluble in water it may be necessary 
to carry out the oxidation in ethanol, methanol, dioxane or acetic acid which 
have been diluted with water. 

It is essential that only a slight excess of the calculated amount of reagent 
required to effect the oxidation is used otherwise oxidation of the reaction 
products may become a significant undesirable side reaction. The course of the 
oxidation may be followed by removing aliquot portions of the reaction mixture 
and determining the amount of unused oxidant. Details of an iodimetric 
procedure are given in Expt. 5.117, Note (1). 

The use of sodium metaperiodate supported on silica gel as an oxidant for diols 
that are insoluble in an aqueous medium is of value. The preparation of the 
reagent is reported as follows. 32 A mixture of sodium metaperiodate (2.00 g), 
silica gel (20.0 g) (1) and deionised water (50 ml) was stirred at 20 °C for 30 
minutes. The water was then removed at lOmmHg using a rotatory evaporator. 
Benzene (50 ml, CAUTION) was added and was evaporated similarly. The 
reagent was finally dried for 16 hours in vacuo (0.5 mmHg) in an oven at 120 °C. 
The reagent generally contained, by iodimetry, c. 0.36 mmol of sodium 
metaperiodate per gram. 

Note. (1) The silica gel was from BDH, chromatographic grade 60-120 mesh. 

56. PEROXYACIDS 

CAUTION: All reactions involving hydrogen peroxide solutions should be carried 

out behind a shatter-proof safety screen (see also Section 4.2.41, p. 439). 

Performic acid is prepared as required by treating 30 per cent hydrogen 
peroxide solution ('100-volume') with excess 88-90 per cent formic acid. 

For many purposes a reagent containing varying amounts of peracetic acid 
can be prepared in situ if convenient by adding 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide (1 
part) to glacial acetic acid (3 parts) in the presence of a catalytic amount of 
sulphuric acid. Alternatively an approximately 40 per cent solution of peracetic 
acid in acetic acid containing a little sulphuric acid is available commercially.* 
The peracetic acid content of the solution may be determined by the iodometric 
procedure described under perbenzoic acid. In use it is sometimes desirable to 
neutralise the sulphuric acid with a stoichiometric amount of sodium acetate; 
the neutralised reagent should not be allowed to stand but should be used 
immediately. 

Pertrifluoroacetic acid may be prepared by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide 
with trifluoroacetic acid. The following procedure gives an anhydrous solution 
of the reagent. Add trifluoroacetic anhydride (25 ml, 0.18 mol) dropwise to a 
stirred suspension of 86 per cent hydrogen peroxide (4. 1 ml, 0.15 mol) in ice-cold

without delay. An oxidation reaction with pertrifluoroacetic acid is described in 
Expt 5.190. 

(F 3 C-CO) 2 + H 2 2 y F 3 C-C0 3 H + F 3 C-C0 2 H 

For perbenzoic acid place 5.2 g (0.225 mol) of sodium in a 500 ml dry conical 
flask provided with a reflux condenser and add 100 ml of absolute methanol; 
slight cooling may be necessary to moderate the vigour of the reaction. Cool the 
resulting solution of sodium methoxide to — 5 °C in a freezing mixture of ice and 
salt: remove the condenser. Add a solution of 50 g (0.206 mol) of freshly 
recrystallised benzoyl peroxide (Section 4.2.6, p. 417) (1) in 200 ml of chloro- 
form (CAUTION), with shaking and cooling, at such a rate that the 
temperature does not rise above °C. Keep the mixture in the ice-salt bath for 5 
minutes with continuous shaking; it turns milky but no precipitate appears. 
Transfer the reaction mixture to a 1 -litre separatory funnel and extract the 
sodium perbenzoate with 500 ml of water containing much crushed ice. It is 
essential that the separation be carried out as rapidly as possible and the 
temperature kept as near 0°C as feasible, especially before the free acid is 
liberated from the sodium salt. Separate the chloroform layer, and extract the 
aqueous layer twice with 100 ml portions of cold chloroform to remove the 
methyl benzoate. Liberate the perbenzoic acid from the aqueous solution by the 
addition of 225 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m sulphuric acid and extract it from solution 
with three 100 ml portions of cold chloroform. Dry the moist chloroform 
solution (about 308 ml) with a little anhydrous sodium sulphate, transfer to a 
polyethylene container (not glass), and keep it in an ice box or a refrigerator 
until required (2); it contains about 24 g (84%) of perbenzoic acid. To determine 
the exact perbenzoic acid content of the solution, proceed as follows. Dissolve 
1.5 g of sodium iodide in 50 ml of water in a 250-ml reagent bottle, and add 
about 5 ml of glacial acetic acid and 5 ml of chloroform. Introduce a known 
weight or volume of the chloroform solution of perbenzoic acid and shake 
vigorously. Titrate the liberated iodine with standard 0.1 m sodium thiosulphate 
solution in the usual manner. 

1 ml of 0.1 m Na 2 S 2 3 = 0.006 9 g of perbenzoic acid 

Notes. (1) It is essential to use freshly recrystallised benzoyl peroxide since the 
commercial material usually gives poor results. The material may be assayed as described 
in Section 4.2.6, p. 417. 
(2) Perbenzoic acid is used for the conversion of olefinic compounds into epoxides.

The number of olefinic linkages in a given compound can be established with accuracy by 
quantitative titration with perbenzoic acid. A solution of the substance and excess 
perbenzoic acid in chloroform is allowed to stand for several hours at a low temperature 
and the amount of unreacted perbenzoic acid in solution is determined: a blank 
experiment is run simultaneously. 

To obtain crystalline perbenzoic acid the following procedure may be 
adopted, the operation being conducted behind a shatter-proof screen. Dry the 
moist chloroform solution with a little sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate 
for an hour, filter and wash the desiccant with a little dry chloroform. Remove

SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



the chloroform under reduced pressure at the ordinary temperature while 
carbon dioxide is introduced through a capillary tube. Dry the white or pale- 
yellow residue for several hours at 30-35 °C under lOmmHg pressure. The yield 
of crystalline perbenzoic acid, m.p. about 42 °C, which is contaminated with a 
little benzoic acid, is 22 g. 

Perbenzoic acid may be recrystallised by dissolving it in a mixture of 3 parts 
of light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C; freed from alkenes, Section 4.1.7, p. 397) and 1 
part ether using about 4-5 ml per gram, seeding and cooling to — 20 °C. (Use a 
shatter-proof screen.) Long white needles, m.p. 41-42 °C, are obtained. It is 
moderately stable when kept in the dark at low temperatures ( — 20 °C); it is very 
soluble in chloroform, ethyl acetate and ether, but only slightly soluble in cold 
water and in cold light petroleum. 

Solutions of m-chloroperbenzoic acid (MCPBA) are stable at moderate 
temperatures for prolonged periods. It is therefore a versatile oxidising agent for 
organic synthesis. m-Chloroperbenzoic acid of 99 per cent assay can be obtained 
by washing the commercially available technical product (80-85%) with a 
phosphate buffer of pH 7.5 and drying the residue under reduced pressure. The 
per-acid can be assayed iodometrically before use. 

A convenient general method for the conversion of aliphatic and aromatic 
carboxylic acids into the corresponding peroxyacids involves reaction with 70 
per cent hydrogen peroxide in the presence of methanesulphonic acid. 33 

57. PHOSGENE (Carbonyl chloride) 

Phosgene may be purchased in cylinders or in the form of a solution (c. 12.5% by 
weight) in toluene in glass ampoules. CAUTION: Owing to the very poisonous 
character of the gas (b.p. 8 °C), all operations with it must be conducted in a fume 
cupboard provided with a powerful draught, and all excess of phosgene must be 
absorbed in 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution.* The preparation of the gas 
is rarely undertaken in the laboratory, but small quantities may be prepared by 
the following procedure. The apparatus (assembled in a fume chamber) consists 
of a flask with a short reflux condenser carrying in the top cone a socket/cone 
adapter with 'T' connection fitted with a dropping funnel. The 'T' connection is 
attached to a train of Drechsel bottles as shown in Fig. 4.5; A and C act as safety 
traps, the phosgene is absorbed in the toluene contained in B, and the hydrogen 
chloride and traces of phosgene are absorbed in the 20 per cent aqueous sodium 
hydroxide solution contained in D. Concentrated sulphuric acid, to which 2 per 
cent by weight of ignited kieselguhr has been added, is placed in the flask; carbon 
tetrachloride (CAUTION) is introduced into the dropping funnel. The sul- 
phuric acid is heated to 120-130 °C in an oil bath and the carbon tetrachloride is 
allowed to drop in slowly; the resulting phosgene is absorbed in the toluene (B), 
while the hydrogen chloride is retained in D. 

3CC1 4 + 2H 2 S0 4 »■ 3COCl 2 + 4HC1 + S 2 5 C1 2 



* It is usually advisable to suspend in the fume cupboard in which operations involving phosgene 
are being carried out, several filter-papers dipped in an ethanolic solution containing 5 per cent of p- 
dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and 5 per cent of colourless diphenylamine. A dangerous quantity of 
phosgene in the atmosphere is indicated by a colour change from yellow to deep orange. An 
additional precaution which is recommended is that the worker should wear a suitable gas mask; 
this is essential when the apparatus is disconnected for cleaning.

58. PHOSPHORIC ACID 

Commercial syrupy orthophosphoric acid has an approximate composition of 
88-90 per cent w/w H 3 P0 4 (d 1.75; 1.57 g H 3 P0 4 per ml; 65% P 2 O s equivalent). 
An approximately 100 per cent w/w H 3 P0 4 (anhydrous orthophosphoric acid) 
is also marketed (72% P 2 5 equivalent) but may be prepared from the 90 per 
cent H3PO4 by mixing with cooling four parts by weight of 90 per cent H 3 P0 4 
with one part of phosphoric oxide. 

Polyphosphoric acid (tetraphosphoric acid), having an approximate compo- 
sition 2P 2 5 -3H 2 0, has a phosphoric oxide equivalent of 82-84 per cent. As 
supplied commercially it is a very viscous liquid and difficult to handle at 
laboratory temperature. Warming on a steam bath produces a mobile liquid 
which can readily be poured. Alternatively a satisfactory reagent can be 
prepared in the laboratory by dissolving 1.8 parts by weight of phosphoric oxide 
in 1 part by weight of 88-90 per cent H 3 P0 4 ; this reagent has a phosphoric 
oxide equivalent of 87 per cent. 

59. PHOSPHORUS (RED) 

Commercial red phosphorus is usually contaminated with small quantities of 
acidic products. It should be boiled for 1 5 minutes with distilled water, allowed 
to settle, decanted through a Buchner funnel and then washed two or three times 
with boiling water by decantation. Finally the phosphorus is completely 
transferred to the Buchner funnel and washed with hot water until the washings 
are neutral. It is dried at 100 °C, and kept in a desiccator or in a tightly stoppered 
bottle. 

60. PHOSPHORUS TRIBROMIDE 

Into a 500-ml three-necked flask, provided with a sealed mechanical stirrer (1), a 
dropping funnel and a reflux condenser, are placed 28 g of purified red 



458 



SOLVENTS ANO REAGENTS 47 



phosphorus (59. above), and 200 ml of carbon tetrachloride (dried over 
anhydrous calcium chloride) (CAUTION). Dry bromine (198 g; 63.5 ml) is 
placed in the dropping funnel and added to the vigorously stirred contents of the 
flask at the rate of about 3 drops per second. A little hydrogen bromide is 
evolved and the preparation should be carried out in a fume cupboard. After all 
the bromine has been added, the mixture is refluxed for 1 5 minutes by immersing 
the flask in a water bath at 80-90 °C. The clear solution is then decanted through 
a fluted filter paper, and the carbon tetrachloride is distilled off through a short 
column (e.g. the all-glass Dufton column, Section 2.26); the residue, upon 
distillation through the well-lagged column, boils at 166-169 °C (mainly at 
168°C). The yield is 190 g (78%). 

Note. (1) A precision-ground glass stirrer unit is most satisfactory. 

61. PLATINUM DIOXIDE (Adams' catalyst) 

Platinum dioxide for use in hydrogenations is available commercially. It may 

alternatively be prepared by either of the following methods. 

Method 1 (from ammonium chloroplatinate). Place 3.0 g of ammonium 
chloroplatinate and 30 g of sodium nitrate (AnalaR) (1) in a Pyrex beaker or 
porcelain dish and heat gently at first until the rapid evolution of gas slackens 
and then more strongly until a temperature of about 300 °C is reached. This 
operation occupies about 1 5 minutes, and there is no spattering. Maintain the 
fluid mass at 500-530 °C for 30 minutes, and allow the mixture to cool. Treat the 
solid mass with 50 ml of water. The brown precipitate of platinum oxide 
(Pt0 2 -H 2 0) settles to the bottom. Wash it once or twice by decantation, filter 
through a hardened filter paper and wash on the filter until practically free from 
nitrates. Stop the washing process immediately the precipitate tends to become 
colloidal (2): traces of sodium nitrate do not affect the efficiency of the catalyst. 
Dry the oxide in a desiccator, and weigh out portions of the dried material as 
required. 

Method 2 (from chloroplatinic acid). Dissolve 3.5 g of the purest commercial 
chloroplatinic acid in 10 ml of water contained in a 250-ml Pyrex beaker or 
porcelain basin, and add 35 g of sodium nitrate (AnalaR) (1). Evaporate the 
mixture to dryness by heating gently over a Bunsen flame while stirring with a 
glass rod. Then raise the temperature to 350-370 °C within about 10 minutes: 
fusion will occur accompanied by the evolution of brown oxides of nitrogen and 
the gradual separation of a precipitate of brown platinum oxide. If foaming 
occurs, stir the mixture more vigorously and direct an additional flame at the 
top of the reaction mixture, if necessary. If the burner beneath the beaker is 
removed when frothing commences, the top of the fused mass solidifies and 
material may be carried over the sides of the vessel. After 1 5 minutes, when the 
temperature has reached about 400 °C, the evolution of gas decreases consider- 
ably. Continue the heating until at the end of 20 minutes the temperature is 500- 
550 °C; at this stage the evolution of oxides of nitrogen has practically ceased 
and there is a gentle evolution of gas. Maintain the temperature at this point 
(best with the full force of a Bunsen burner) for about 30 minutes, by which time 
fusion is complete. Allow the mass to cool (the Pyrex beaker may crack), add 
50 ml of water and proceed as in Method 1. 



459 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Notes. (1) The use of an equivalent quantity of potassium nitrate (AnalaR) is said to 
produce a more active catalyst. 

(2) It is advisable to test a small portion of the filtrate for platinum by acidifying with 
hydrochloric acid and adding a few drops of tin(n) chloride solution: a yellow or brown 
colour develops according to the quantity of platinum present. The yellow colour is 
soluble in ether, thus rendering the test more sensitive. If platinum is found, treat the 
filtrate with excess of formaldehyde and sodium hydroxide solution and heat; platinum 
black separates on standing and may be filtered and worked up with other platinum 
residues. 

Platinum residues from hydrogenation reactions should be carefully pre- 
served and subsequently recovered by conversion into ammonium chloro- 
platinate by the following method. Dissolve the platinum or platinum residues 
in aqua regia, evaporate just to dryness several times with concentrated 
hydrochloric acid, dissolve the final residue in a little water and filter. Precipitate 
ammonium chloroplatinate from the filtrate by addition of excess of a saturated 
solution of ammonium chloride. Filter and dry the precipitate at 100°C. 

62. POTASSIUM 

CAUTION: Great care must be taken in the handling of potassium and the 
following precautions must be rigorously observed. Cut the metal under light 
petroleum (which has been dried over sodium wire) contained in a mortar: do 
not use a beaker or a crystallising dish because it is too fragile. Cut off the outer 
oxide-coated surface and immediately transfer the scraps with tweezers to a 
second mortar containing dry light petroleum. Weigh the freshly cut potassium 
by removing it with tweezers to a filter paper, blot it rapidly and introduce it into 
a tared beaker containing dry light petroleum. Introduce the weighed potassium 
into the reaction mixture. The scraps of potassium should not be stored; they 
must be decomposed immediately by transferring the mortar to the rear of an 
empty fume cupboard and adding t-butyl alcohol (not methanol or ethanol) in 
small portions from a dropper pipette at such a rate that the reaction does not 
become vigorous. Keep a square of heat-resistant sheet, large enough to cover 
the mortar, at hand; if the liquid should catch fire, it may be extinguished 
easily by covering the mortar with the heat-resistant sheet. Add sufficient t-butyl 
alcohol to react completely with all the potassium. Any specks of potassium 
remaining in the first mortar used for the cutting operation or small scraps that 
adhere to the knife must be disposed of in the fume cupboard by cautious 
treatment with t-butyl alcohol as described above. 

63. POTASSIUM FLUORIDE 

Finely powdered, anhydrous potassium fluoride may be prepared as follows (see 
Expt 5.61). Grind finely pure laboratory grade, anhydrous potassium fluoride, 
and heat it in an electrically-heated oven at 180-210 °C; store in a desiccator. 
Before use, dry the powdered salt at 180 °C for 3 hours and grind again in a 
warm (c. 50 °C) glass mortar. 

64. SELENIUM DIOXIDE 

The preparation of any quantity of selenium dioxide from selenium is hardly 
worth while, and it is better to purify the commercially available dioxide. 
Extreme care should be taken in this operation, which should be conducted in an 
efficient fume cupboard, because of the very poisonous properties of selenium 

460 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



compounds. The crude dioxide is sublimed in one of the assemblies described in 
Section 2.21, appropriate to the quantity of material needed. The sublimate of 
pure selenium dioxide is obtained in colourless, long, needle-like crystals which 
should be stored in a tightly stoppered bottle. 

65. SILVER NITRITE 

Warm concentrated solutions of silver nitrate (containing 48 g of AgN0 3 ) and 
potassium nitrite (containing 30 g of KN0 2 ) are mixed, and the mixture is 
allowed to cool. The silver nitrite which separates is filtered off and washed with 
water. It may be recrystallised from water at 70 °C, and is dried either in a 
vacuum desiccator or in an air oven at about 40 °C; the yield is about 90 per 
cent. Silver nitrite should be stored in a tightly-stoppered amber bottle. 

66. SILYLATING AGENTS 

A range of reagents is available to introduce silyl groups into organic molecules 
for use in synthesis, or in gas liquid chromatography to achieve appropriate 
volatility. 

Chlorotrimethylsilane is a valuable reagent for the protection of the hydroxyl 
function in organic synthesis (Sections 5.4.6, p. 550 and 5.11.8, p. 690). It is a 
corrosive, flammable liquid, b.p. 57 °C. It should be distilled from calcium 
hydride (or tributylamine) under nitrogen before use, and stored and weighed 
under nitrogen. Use of the reagent without purification has been reported to 
lead to explosions. Chlorotrimethylsilane may contain dichlorodimethylsilane 
as an impurity. This may be removed before distillation by very cautious 
treatment with a small amount of water, which hydrolyses the dichloro 
compound more rapidly. Excess chlorotrimethylsilane in a reaction mixture 
may be destroyed by the very careful addition of aqueous sodium hydrogen 
carbonate solution. Use of the reagent in synthesis is described in Expts 5.56 and 
7.10. Chlorotrimethylsilane has been used, in conjunction with other silylating 
agents, for the preparation of volatile derivatives of a range of biologically active 
compounds for analysis by gas chromatography, but it has been largely 
superseded for this purpose by other silylating agents such as bis- 
trimethylsilylacetamide and bis-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (Section 2.31). 

Alternative silyl protecting groups can be introduced by the appropriate 
choice of reagents. t-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride is a useful reagent for the 
introduction of the t-butyldimethylsilyl protecting group. It is a flammable, 
corrosive solid, m.p. 86-89 °C, b.p. 125 °C. The use of the reagent for the 
preparation of t-butyldimethylsilyl esters is illustrated by the following typical 
example. 34 To a solution of 13.0g (lOOmmol) of heptanoic acid and 15.82 g 
(105mmol) of t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in 20 ml of dry DMF was added 
1 3.96 g (205 mmol) of imidazole. The solution was stirred overnight, poured into 
water, and extracted with petroleum ether. The organic solution was washed 
with a saturated solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate and dried over 
magnesium sulphate. The solvent was removed and the residue was distilled 
(95-100 °C/1.5mmHg) giving 21.0 g (86%) of t-butyldimethylsilyl heptanoate; 
p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 /TMS) 5 2.30 (t, 2H, CH 2 CO), 1.30 (m, 8H, — (CH 2 ) 4 — ), 
0.97 (s, 12H, SiC(CH 3 ) 3 , terminal CH 3 ), 0.27 (s, 6H, Si(CH 3 ) 2 ; i.r. spectrum 
(neat) 1730 cm" 1 .

4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



67. SODAMIDE 

Sodamide is available in a granular form having a purity in the region of 80-90 
per cent, but it is rather difficult to pulversise which in any case must be done by 
grinding in a glass mortar under an inert hydrocarbon solvent (toluene, xylene, 
etc.). Powdered sodamide of high activity, free from sodium and oxygenated 
components, is also commercially available (e.g. from May and Baker) in 25-g 
bottles or 500-g tins. Sodamide should never be stored in a stoppered bottle 
from which samples are to be removed intermittently, since dangerous mixtures 
may result when the substance is exposed for 2-3 days to even limited amounts 
of air at ordinary temperature. As a safe practice, sodamide should be used 
immediately the container is opened and should not be kept longer than 12-24 
hours unless under an inert solvent. In all cases where the sodamide has been 
seen to become yellowish or brown in colour, due to the formation of oxidation 
products, the resulting mixture should not be used, as it may be highly explosive; it 
should be destroyed by covering with toluene and slowly adding, with stirring, 
ethanol diluted with toluene. Small amounts of unused sodamide should be 
destroyed by the addition of methanol or ethanol; see also p. 37. 

In many reactions involving the use of sodamide it is frequently more 
convenient to prepare the reagent in situ by the iron(m) ion catalysed reaction of 
sodium (see 68 below) with liquid ammonia. In a 500-ml three-necked flask, 
equipped with a removable glass stopper, sealed stirrer unit of the Hershberg 
type and a reflux condenser with soda-lime guard-tube, place 300 ml of 
anhydrous liquid ammonia (see Section 2.17.7, p. 116). Add just sufficient 
sodium (0.5 g) to the stirred liquid to produce a permanent blue colour, then 
0.5 g of powdered iron(m) nitrate (to catalyse the conversion of sodium into 
sodamide), followed by 13.3 g of clean sodium metal (cut into small pieces) over 
a period of 30 minutes. When the sodium has been converted into sodamide (as 
indicated by the change from a blue solution to a grey suspension) allow the 
ammonia to evaporate (Section 2.17.7, p. 1 16) adding sufficient anhydrous ether 
through a dropping funnel to keep the volume of the liquid at about 300 ml. 
After nearly all the ammonia has evaporated, stir the suspension of 
sodamide and heat under reflux for 5 minutes, and then cool to room 
temperature. A suspension of 23.4 g of sodamide in dry ether is thus obtained; 
the conversion is practically quantitative. 

68. SODIUM 

CAUTION: Sodium must be handled with great care and under no circumstances 
should the metal be allowed to come into contact with water as a dangerous 
explosion may result. Sodium is stored under solvent naphtha (petroleum 
distillates, b.p. 1 52-204 °C) or xylene; it should not be handled with the fingers 
but with tongs or tweezers. Waste or scrap pieces of sodium should be placed in 
a bottle provided for the purpose and containing solvent naphtha or xylene; they 
should never be thrown into the sink or into the waste box. If it is desired to 
destroy scrap sodium, it should be added in small portions to a rather large 
quantity of industrial spirit. The preparation of sodium wire is described under 
the technique of drying of ether, Section 4.1.75, p. 404. Granulated sodium (also 
termed molecular sodium, powdered sodium or sodium sand) may be conveniently 
prepared by either of the following methods which require clean sodium. 
Commercial sodium is invariably covered with a non-metallic crust which is 
usually shaved off with a knife under a dry inert solvent (e.g. ether, xylene) before 

462 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



use. As this procedure is rather wasteful the alternative method recommended 
is to be preferred. 35 Here, lumps of sodium metal are immersed in dry xylene 
contained in a wide-mouthed conical flask and heated carefully on an electric 
hot-plate with gentle swirling until the sodium just melts and flows away from 
the contaminating surface oxide. The flask is then removed from the hot-plate 
and upon cooling the sodium melt solidifies in globules which may then be 
removed with a pointed spatula to be immediately reimmersed under fresh inert 
solvent. The residual crust, after decantation of the xylene, is covered with 
industrial spirit to ensure the safe destruction of the remaining traces of sodium 
metal, see also p. 41. 

Method 1. Twenty-three grams of clean sodium* are introduced into a 750- or 
1000-ml, round-bottomed Pyrex flask containing about 200 ml of sodium-dried 
xylene, or at least sufficient xylene to cover the sodium completely, and the flask 
is placed on a sand bath. Two or three thicknesses of dry cloth (or a thick towel), 
sufficient to envelop the whole flask, are placed in a convenient position on the 
bench. The sand bath is heated cautiously and the ring of condensed vapour of 
the xylene is carefully watched. When the ring of condensed vapour has risen to 
within 2.5 cm from the neck of the flask the flame beneath the burner is 
extinguished. A well-fitting rubber stopper or good quality bark cork is rapidly 
fitted into the flask neck and the flask is completely wrapped in the previously 
prepared cloth. The stopper is held firmly in place through the enveloping cloth 
and the flask is shaken vigorously for 30-60 seconds or until the molten sodium 
is converted into a fine dispersion. The flask is then placed on a cork ring and the 
stopper immediately removed. The sodium is thus obtained in the form of small 
spheres the size of which is controlled by the time and rapidity of the shaking. 
Any particles of sodium adhering to the sides of the flask are washed under the 
xylene. When the contents of the flask have cooled to room temperature, the 
xylene may be decanted and the sodium washed twice with 100 ml of sodium- 
dried ether to remove traces of xylene; finally the finely-divided sodium is 
covered with absolute ether. A bucket, half full of dry sand, should be kept at 
hand in case of breakage of the flask. Not more than 25-30 g of sodium should 
be powdered at one time by this procedure. 

Method 2. It is often convenient to prepare the powdered sodium in the flask in 
which the subsequent reaction is to be carried out; this is usually a three-necked 
flask. Into a 1 -litre three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser (protected 
by a drying tube containing soda lime), a sealed stirrer and a dropping funnel 
are placed 23 g of clean sodium and 1 50-200 ml of sodium-dried xylene. The 
flask is surrounded by a mantle and heated until the sodium has melted. The 
stirrer is started and, after the sodium is suitably granulated, the mantle is 
removed. When the contents of the flask have cooled to the laboratory 
temperature, the stirrer is stopped. The xylene may then be decanted, and the 
sodium washed with two 100 ml portions of sodium -dried ether to remove traces 
of xylene as in Method 1. Large quantities of molecular sodium may be prepared 
by this method. 



* Clean sodium should be weighed under a dry inert solvent; sodium-dried ether or light petroleum 
(b.p. 60-80 °C) is usually used. 

463 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



69. SODIUM ACETATE 

The anhydrous salt is prepared from the crystallised sodium acetate, 
Me &gt; C0 2 Na-3H 2 0, by heating in a large porcelain evaporating basin over a 
small free flame. The salt first liquefies, steam is evolved and the mass solidifies 
as soon as most of the water of crystallisation has been driven off. To remove the 
residual water, the solid is carefully heated with a larger flame, the burner being 
constantly moved until the solid just melts. Care must be taken that the solid is 
not overheated; too strong heating will be recognised by the evolution of 
combustible gases and charring of the substance. The fused salt is allowed to 
solidify and is removed from the vessel while still warm with a knife or spatula. It 
is immediately powdered and stored in a tightly stoppered bottle. 

Commercial fused sodium acetate is usually satisfactory, but if necessary it 
can be melted and maintained in the fused state for several minutes in order to 
remove the water absorbed during storage. 

70. SODIUM AMALGAM 

The amalgam which is generally employed for reductions contains from 1 to 3 
per cent of sodium. Amalgams with a sodium content greater than 1.2 per cent 
are solid at ordinary temperature and can be powdered in a mortar; the 1.2 per 
cent amalgam is semi-solid at room temperature, but is completely fluid at 
50 °C. Clean sodium (22.8 g) is placed in a 500-ml round-bottomed flange flask, 
provided with a dropping funnel (containing 750 g of mercury) in the central 
socket, and inlet and outlet tubes for dry nitrogen in two side sockets. The air is 
displaced by nitrogen. About 10 ml of mercury are added and the flask is 
warmed gently with a free flame until reaction commences. The flame is then 
removed and the reaction is maintained by the slow addition of the mercury. 
When about half the mercury has been introduced, the amalgam will commence 
to solidify; it should be kept molten by heating with occasional shaking. After 
the addition of all the mercury, the hot molten amalgam is poured on to a uralite 
board, powdered in a mortar* and stored in a tightly stoppered bottle. 
Amalgams of 1 and 2 per cent strength may be prepared similarly. 

71. SODIUM CYANIDE 

If necessary, the powdered commercial material (c. 98% pure) may be dried in a 
vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide pellets. Sodium cyanide is very 
poisonous and must be handled with great care. Residual solutions containing 
alkali cyanides should be rendered innocuous by the addition of an excess of 
sodium hypochlorite before being washed down the main drain of the 
laboratory with a liberal supply of water; they should never be treated with acid. 
(Expt 5.157). 

72. SODIUM ETHOXIDE 

This is a flammable, moisture-sensitive solid which is available commercially. It 
may be prepared conveniently in situ as required by the method described in 
Expt 5.103. A solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol is required for many

reactions and is readily prepared by the reaction of sodium with ethanol (Expt 
5.95). A 21 per cent w/w solution in ethanol is also available commercially. 

73. TIN(n) CHLORIDE 

The anhydrous reagent is prepared from the hydrate as follows. Crystalline 
tin(n) chloride, SnCl 2 -2H 2 0, is heated for 1 hour in an oil bath at 195-200 °C, 
the cooled melt is powdered and kept in a desiccator or a tightly stoppered 
bottle. The resulting product, although satisfactory in many instances, is not 
entirely dependable. The following procedure (Stephen, 1930) invariably gives 
an excellent product. In a 400-ml beaker are placed 102 g (89.5 ml; 1 mol) of 
redistilled acetic anhydride, and 123 g of analytical reagent grade tin(n) chloride 
dihydrate (0.5 mol) are added whilst the liquid is stirred either manually or 
mechanically; dehydration is almost instantaneous. The operation must be 
conducted in the fume cupboard as much heat is evolved and the acetic 
anhydride may boil. After about 1 hour, the anhydrous tin(n) chloride is filtered 
off on a Buchner or sintered glass funnel, washed free from acetic acid with two 
30 ml portions of anhydrous ether and dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator. 
Anhydrous tin(n) chloride may be kept for an indefinite period in a desiccator; it 
may also be stored in a tightly stoppered bottle. 

The anhydrous compound is not appreciably hygroscopic, is readily soluble 
in acetone and pentan-1-ol, and insoluble in benzene, toluene, xylene and 
chloroform; it is also readily soluble in absolute methanol or ethanol, but a trace 
of water causes immediate hydrolysis with the formation of an opalescent 
precipitate. 

74. SULPHUR DIOXIDE 

The liquefied gas is commercially available* in aluminium canisters (net weight 
500 g) which are provided with screw-operated valves. 

75. SULPHURIC ACID 

Ordinary concentrated acid, d 1.84, is a constant boiling mixture, b.p. 
338 °C/760mmHg, and it contains 98 per cent w/w H 2 S0 4 (1.799g H 2 S0 4 per 
ml). The 100 per cent acid may be obtained by addition of the calculated 
quantity of oleum 36 ; it is also available commercially. 

Oleum is marketed in a range of strengths up to c. 65 per cent S0 3 . From to 
30 per cent free S0 3 , it is a liquid; from 30 to 55 per cent free S0 3 it is a solid 
(maximum m.p. 35 °C at 45% free S0 3 ); from 60 to 70 per cent free S0 3 , it is a 
liquid. The acid must be kept in ground glass stoppered thick-walled bottles. If it 
is required to melt the acid, the stopper is removed, a watch glass placed on the 
mouth of the bottle, and the bottle is placed on a uralite board in a warm 
temperature-controlled oven at 40 °C. The liquid should be removed from the 
bottle with the aid of an automatic dispenser fitted into the neck; this procedure 
is more satisfactory than that of pouring the liquid acid from the bottle. 

76. SULPHURYL CHLORIDE 

The technical product should be fractionated in an all-glass apparatus; the 
fraction, b.p. 69-70°C, is collected. The pure substance has b.p. 
69°C/760mmHg. 

* For example, from BDH Ltd.

4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



77. THIONYL CHLORIDE 

The technical product frequently contains traces of acids, sulphur chlorides and 
sulphuryl chloride; it is essential to remove these before using the reagent for the 
preparation of acid chlorides, etc. Commercial purified thionyl chloride is 
satisfactory for most purposes. A colourless product of high purity may be 
obtained by either of the following methods. 

Method 1. Commercial thionyl chloride is first fractionated in an all-glass 
apparatus from quinoline in order to remove acid impurities (50 g of thionyl 
chloride from 10 ml of quinoline); the receiver is protected from the entrance of 
moisture by a guard-tube, filled with anhydrous calcium chloride. The distillate 
is then refractionated as before from boiled linseed oil (50 g of thionyl chloride 
from 20 ml of linseed oil), the fraction, b.p. 76-78 °C, being collected. 

Method 2. This method of purification 37 is more economic. Here technical 
thionyl chloride is placed in a distilling flask and not more than 5 per cent w/w 
of dipentene (p-mentha-l,8-diene) added with swirling. The mixture is immedi- 
ately distilled at atmospheric pressure (not reduced pressure), using a gas burner 
(not a heating mantle), without a fractionating column, and with a thermometer 
dipping into the liquid mixture. Distillation is stopped when the temperature of 
the liquid reaches 84—86 °C; between 80 and 90 per cent of the original quantity 
of thionyl chloride having b.p. 76-78 °C will be collected. Redistillation of the 
product, to which 1-2 per cent of linseed oil has been added, through a short 
fractionating column gives pure colourless thionyl chloride having b.p. 
77°C/760mmHg. This reagent must be stored in a well-fitting glass-stoppered 
bottle. 

78. TOLUENE-/&gt;-SULPHONYL CHLORIDE 

Unless the reagent has been recently purchased it may contain substantial 
amounts of toluene-p-sulphonic acid. The most satisfactory procedure for the 
purification of the chloride involves dissolving it in the minimum amount of 
chloroform (about 2.5 ml per g) and diluting with 5 volumes of light petroleum 
(b.p. 40-60 °C), which precipitates impurities. The filtered solution is treated 
with decolourising charcoal, filtered and concentrated to small volume when 
colourless crystals of the pure reagent, m.p. 68 °C, are obtained; these should be 
washed with chilled light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C). 

79. TRIPHENYLMETHYL HALIDES (Trityl halides) 

Triphenylmethyl chloride is commercially available but may contain a propor- 
tion of triphenylmethanol formed by hydrolysis during storage. It may be 
purified by dissolving in about one-half its weight of hot benzene (CAUTION) 
containing 10-20 per cent of acetyl chloride, diluting with two volumes of light 
petroleum, b.p. 60-80 °C, and cooling. The product is filtered rapidly, washed 
with light petroleum and dried in a vacuum desiccator over paraffin wax 
shavings and silica gel to remove solvent. The pure compound has m.p. 112- 
113 °C; it should be stored in a well-stoppered bottle sealed against the ingress of 
moisture. 

Alternatively it may be prepared from triphenylmethanol (10 g) by heat- 
ing under reflux in dry benzene (5 ml) with redistilled acetyl chloride (6.0 ml) 
for 30 minutes. The mixture is cooled, diluted with light petroleum (10 ml, b.p. 

466 



SOLVENTS AND REAGENTS 4.2 



40-60 °C), chilled on an ice bath and the crystals collected and recrystallised and 
stored as described above. 

Triphenylmethyl bromide, m.p. 153-1 54 °C, may be prepared in a similar 
manner from triphenylmethanol and acetyl bromide. 

80. ZINC 

Commercial zinc powder is usually about 90 per cent pure and requires acid 
treatment to remove surface oxide which reduces its activity. The zinc may be 
activated by stirring, say, 400 g of powder with 150 ml of 10 per cent 
hydrochloric acid for 2 minutes, filtering and washing with 300 ml of water 
followed by 100 ml of acetone. The zinc powder should be analysed, if the 
amount of zinc required in a reaction procedure is critical, by one of the 
published methods. 38 Zinc is also available in the form of sheet, wire and wool. 

One method of preparation of a zinc-copper couple is described in Expt 6. 1 55. 
It may also be prepared by stirring activated zinc dust with 2 per cent aqueous 
copper sulphate solution and washing successively and thoroughly with water, 
absolute ethanol and dry ether, Expt 5.21. 

Zinc amalgam (for Clemmensen reduction) may be prepared by either of the 
following two methods. 

Method 1. Two hundred grams of zinc wool are placed in a 2-litre, three-necked 
flask and covered with a 10-15 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide. The flask 
is gently warmed on a water bath until hydrogen is vigorously evolved 
(CAUTION); the sodium hydroxide solution is then immediately poured off (it 
may be necessary to dilute with water first in order to moderate the vigour of the 
reaction), and the zinc is washed repeatedly with distilled water until most, if not 
all, of the sodium hydroxide has been removed. The zinc is then covered with a 
1 per cent solution of mercury(n) chloride and allowed to stand for 30-60 min- 
utes with occasional shaking. The mercury(n) chloride solution is then poured off, 
and the amalgamated zinc is washed twice with distilled water. The amalga- 
mated zinc is then covered with 500 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 
100 ml of water. The compound (about 0.3-0.4 mol) to be reduced is then added, 
and the reaction is allowed to proceed while a current of hydrogen chloride gas 
is passed through the liquid. 

Method 2. 39 A mixture of 200 g of zinc wool, 15 g of mercury(n) chloride, 10 ml 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 250 ml of water is stirred or shaken for 5 
minutes. The aqueous solution is decanted, and the amalgamated zinc is covered 
with 150 ml of water and 200 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The material 
(about 0.3-0.4 mol) to be reduced is then added immediately and the reaction is 
commenced. 

81. ZINC CYANIDE 

The preparation of zinc cyanide should be carried out in the fume cupboard and 
great caution exercised in the handling of the cyanides. Prepare solutions 
containing lOOg of technical sodium cyanide (97-98% NaCN) (CAUTION) in 
125 ml of water and 150g of anhydrous zinc chloride in the minimum volume of 
50 per cent ethanol (1). Add the sodium cyanide solution rapdily, with agitation, 
to the zinc chloride solution. Filter off the precipitated zinc cyanide at the pump, 
drain well, wash with ethanol and then with ether. Dry the product in a 
desiccator or in an air bath at 50 °C, and preserve in a tightly stoppered bottle. 

467 



4.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The yield is almost quantitative and the zinc cyanide has a purity of 95-98 per 
cent. It has been stated that highly purified zinc cyanide does not react in the 
Adams' modification of the Gattermann reaction (compare Expt 6.113). The 
product, prepared by the above method, is, however, highly satisfactory. 
Commercial zinc cyanide may also be used. 

Note. (1) It is important in this preparation to ensure an excess of zinc chloride over 
sodium cyanide. If the la.tter is in excess, the zinc cyanide generally precipitates as a sticky 
mass, which is difficult to filter and unsatisfactory for the preparation of phenolic 
aldehydes.

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 



5.1 ALKANES 

The acyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons have the general formula C n H 2n + 2; cyclic 
saturated hydrocarbons (alicyclic hydrocarbons) have the general formula 
C n H 2n (if monocyclic), C n H 2n -2 (if bicyclic), etc. The structures of these hydro- 
carbons may be represented in the chemical literature in various ways; some 
common conventions which are used freely in texts are illustrated here. 

Alkyl groups ( — C n H 2n + i) up to four carbon atoms are frequently abbre- 
viated thus: — CH 3 = Me; — C 2 H 5 = Et; — C 3 H 7 = Pr or Pr 1 ; — C 4 H 9 = Bu; or 
Bu\ or Bu'. Illustrative representations of: 

butane (1); 
2-methylbutane (2); 
2,3-dimethylpentane (3); 
and 2,2,3-trimethylpentane (4); 

are given below. The presence of chiral carbons atoms (marked with an asterisk) 
may be significant; thus (1) and (2) are achiral molecules, but (3) and (4) are 
chiral.

Particularly with alicyclic compounds the Me notation shown above for a

other alkyl groups may be drawn out in full. This is illustrated below for 
l-methyl-4-isopropylcyclohexane (5), and l-butyl-4-ethylcyclohexane (6).

The synthesis of alkanes is exemplified by the following typical procedures. 

1. The catalytic hydrogenation and the chemical reduction of alkenes (Expts 5.1 

and 5.2). 

2. The hydrolysis of alkylmagnesium halides (Expt 5.3), and the hydrogenolysis 
of alkyl halides and of alkyl methane- or toluene-p-sulphonates (Expt 5.4). 

3. The reduction of aldehydes and ketones (Expts 5.5 and 5.6). 

4. Coupling reactions (a) using organometallic compounds (Expts 5.7 to 5.10), 
and (b) at the anode (Expt 5.11).

5.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The i.r. absorption spectra of the open-chain alkanes and of the saturated cyclic 
hydrocarbons show few, but characteristic, absorption bands. These are found 
just below 3000cm" l (C — H str.), at approximately 1450 and 1375 cm" 1 (C — H 
deform.) and near 725 cm -1 [(CH 2 ) n , n ^ 4, rock); no other absorption is 
present [e.g. Fig. 3.13(b) decane]. The diagnostic value of i.r. absorption is 
limited to a broad assessment of the degree of branching in the carbon chain 
from inspection of high resolution spectra of the carbon-hydrogen stretching 
region (p. 273). The p.m.r. spectra of alkanes are of very limited value for struc- 
tural assignment; l3 C-n.m.r. however has become of particular use in this respect 
(see Fig. 3.41, p. 320). The m.s. of alkanes may give some structural information 
on the degree of branching (p. 374); the spectra of decane and 2,6-dimethyl- 
octane [Fig. 3.79(a) and 3.79(b)] are illustrative. Alkanes do not absorb in the 
accessible u.v.-visible region. 

5.1.1 THE CATALYTIC HYDROGENATION AND CHEMICAL REDUCTION OF ALKENES 

Conversion of an alkene (or an alkyne) into an alkane is readily achieved by 
shaking it under hydrogen at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure in 
the presence of a platinium or palladium catalyst. With a Raney nickel catalyst 
somewhat higher temperatures and pressures are employed (see Section 2.17.1, 
p. 88). 

R'-CH=CH-R 2 -£-&gt; R'-CH 2 -CH 2 -R 2 «-|£- R'-C=C-R 2 

The method is illustrated by the conversion of 2-methylbut-2-ene (Expt 5.12) 
into 2-methylbutane (Expt 5.1). The experiment has been incorporated to illus- 
trate the handling of low boiling point liquids, and also to illustrate some 
aspects of interpretative infrared spectroscopy. 

The rate of catalytic hydrogenation of a carbon-carbon double bond 
depends to some extent on the degree of substitution and environmental 
hindrance. In general the more highly substituted (or highly hindered) alkene 
will be hydrogenated more slowly. Such differences in rate have been exploited 
in the hydrogenation of dienes to effect a conversion into a mono-ene. A good 
selective catalyst is P-2 nickel bo ride, 1 generated in situ from nickel(n) acetate 
and sodium borohydride, and its use in the large-scale conversion of dicyclo- 
pentadiene into 5.6-dihydro-endo-dicyclopentadiene 2 is described in Expt 5.2. 
Details are also included (Note 3 to Expt 5.2) of a smaller scale general pro- 
cedure for use as a preliminary step in the study of a new diene system. 2 Selective 
chemical reduction of mono- and di-substituted alkenes has also been effected 
by a complex species produced by the reaction of cobalt(n) chloride and sodium 
borohydride. 3 

Experiment 5.1 2-METHYLBUTANE 

Me-CH=CMe 2 — ^-&gt; Me-CH 2 -CHMe 2 

Place 100 mg of Adams' platinum dioxide catalyst (Section 4.2.67, p. 459) and 
9.8 g (0.14mol) of 2-methylbut-2-ene in a 100-ml hydrogenation flask 
(Section 2.17.1, p. 89). Attach the flask to the adapter of the atmospheric

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.1 



hydrogen ation apparatus (Fig. 2.63(a)) and cool the lower part in an ice- 
water bath. Fill the flask and gas burettes with hydrogen by the procedure 
discussed in Section 2.17.1, p. 89; note the volumes in the gas burettes, 
remove the cooling bath and gently agitate the flask. When uptake of hydro- 
gen ceases (the catalyst often coagulates and collects at the bottom of the 
flask at this stage), note the total volume of hydrogen absorbed; this should 
be in the region of 3 litres. Cool the flask contents and follow the procedure 
for replacing the hydrogen in the apparatus with air. Disconnect the hydro- 
genation flask and with a suitably sized dropper pipette transfer the liquid to 
a small distillation flask leaving the catalyst in the hydrogenation flask (1). 
Distil the 2-methylbutane (b.p. 30 °C) using a small ice-cooled water con- 
denser with the receiver flask immersed in an ice-salt cooling bath (2). The 
yield is 7 g (70%). Record the i.r. spectrum and compare it with the spectrum 
of the starting material (3). Note (a) the disappearance upon hydrogenation 
of the absorption bands at 810 and 1675 cm" 1 (due to the out-of-plane 
deformation of the =C — H bond and the stretching of the carbon-carbon 
double bond respectively) in the alkene, and (b) the replacement of the peak 
at 1380 cm" ! in the alkene ( — CH 3 bending mode) by a doublet at 1385 and 
1375 cm" 1 ((CH 3 ) 2 C — plus terminal — CH 3 ). The m.s. shows principal frag- 
ment ions at m/z 72 (M), 57 (M— CH 3 ), 43 (M— C 2 H 5 , base peak) and at 29 
(C 2 H 5 ®). 

Notes. (1) This technique, rather than conventional filtration, is to be preferred in this 
case owing to the high volatility of the hydrocarbon. For details on the disposal and 
recovery of the catalyst see Section 2.17.1, p. 89, Hydrogenation at atmospheric pres- 
sure (12). 

(2) An alternative and convenient arrangement is to supply the condenser with cooled 
water from an ice/water reservoir by means of a peristatic pump. 

(3) In both cases a fixed path length cell (0.025 mm) should be employed. 

Experiment 5.2 5,6-DIHYDRO-EVOODICYCLOPENTADIENE 2 




Dicyclopentadiene is chilled until a major proportion has solidified. The 
material is filtered and the solid is pressed on a Buchner funnel with a spatula 
to remove as much liquid as possible. The solid is warmed just to melt and the 
process is repeated. The resulting solid has m.p. 28-30 °C (lit. 4 m.p. 27-28 °C). 

In a 2-litre flask, 37.5 g (150mmol) of nickel(n) acetate tetrahydrate (1) are 
dissolved in 200 ml of 95 per cent ethanol. The flask is attached to a Brown 2 
hydrogenator and flushed with hydrogen. With rapid stirring 150 ml of 1.0 m 
sodium borohydride solution in ethanol (2) is added to reduce the nickel 
acetate to P-2 nickel. The purified endo-dicyclopentadiene (407 g, 3.08 mol) is 
melted with 200 ml of ethanol and the mixture injected into the hydrogenator. 
With vigorous stirring, the reaction proceeds smoothly; hydrogen uptake 
ceases when 3.08 mol of hydrogen has been absorbed. 

Five grams of activated carbon are added to the reaction mixture to aid in 
catalyst removal, and the warm (40 °C) mixture is filtered through a thin 
(c. 3 mm) pad of carbon on a Buchner funnel. The filter pad is washed with

2 x 100 ml of warm acetone. The combined organic layers are distilled to 
remove solvent. The residue is distilled through a short Vigreux column to 
give 370 g, 2.76 mol (90%) of 5,6-dihydro-ew/o-dicyclopentadiene, b.p. 178— 
180 °C, m.p. 48-50 °C. Recrystallisation from methanol gives m.p. 50 °C 
(lit. 5 48.5-50 °C); p.m.r. (CC1 4 , TMS), 8 1.25 (s, 3.8H), 1.45 (s, 2.2H), 2.0-3.2 
(m, broad, 6.2H), 5.70 (s, broad, 2.0H). The product was free from starting 
material by g.l.c. analysis. 

Notes. (1) The nickel(u) acetate tetrahydrate was AnalaR grade. 

(2) A stabilised solution suitable for catalytic reduction was prepared by dissolving 
4.0 g of sodium borohydride powder in a mixture of 95 ml of absolute ethanol and 5 ml 
of 2 M sodium hydroxide and filtering the resulting solution. This solution is best pre- 
pared freshly the day of use for maximum catalyst reproducibility but may be utilised 
satisfactorily for up to 5 days if kept refrigerated. Formation of small amounts of sedi- 
ment under refrigeration is not harmful. 

(3) Details of a procedure for smaller scale exploratory experiments are given as 
follows. 2 Nickel(n) acetate tetrahydrate (1.24 g, 5.00 mmol) is dissolved in (50 — n)ml 
(n = volume of substrate to be added) of 95 per cent ethanol in a 125 ml Erlenmeyer 
flask (modified for high stirring). The flask is attached to a borohydride hydrogenator, 
which is then flushed with nitrogen. With vigorous stirring, 5.0 ml of 1.0 m sodium 
borohydride solution in ethanol (see above) is injected over 15 seconds. When gas 
evolution from the mixture ceases, the catalyst is ready for use. The hydrogenator is 
purged with hydrogen and the reaction initiated by injecting the substrate. Addition 
of solid substrates is accomplished with the stirrer stopped, just before purging with 
hydrogen. Samples for analysis are withdrawn from the reactor with a syringe and 
stainless steel needle. Gas chromatographic columns which are found to be useful 
have stationary phases of either adiponitrile, triethylene glycol-silver nitrate, tris- 
(cyanoethoxy)propane, UCON 50 HB 2000, and squalene. 

5.1.2 THE HYDROLYSIS OF ALKYLMAGNESIUM HALIDES. AND THE HYDROGENOLYSIS 
OF ALKYL HALIDES AND OF ALKYL METHANE- OR TOLUENE ^SULPHONATES 

One of the earliest methods for the conversion of alkyl halides and also, in- 
directly, alcohols into alkanes is the hydrolysis of the corresponding alkyl- 
magnesium halides (Expt 5.3, the preparation of hexane from hexylmagnesium 
bromide). More recently complex borohydrides (in particular lithium triethyl- 
borohydride, 'Superhydride'), 6 and also a reducing system formed from sodium 
hydride, an alkoxide and a metallic salt [e.g. FeCl 3 , Ni(OAc) 2 , ZnCl 2 or CdCl 2 ] 
have been used for the hydrogenolysis of alkyl halides. 7

RX — ^&gt; R-MgX — ^ RH ^- RX 

Superhydride has also been used for the hydrogenolysis of alkyl toluene-p- 
sulphonates, and an illustrative example is given in Expt 5.4 for the preparation 
of cyclooctane from cyclooctyl toluene-p-sulphonate. A sodium borohydride 
hydrogenolysis of alkyl halides and of alkyl methane- and toluene-p- 
sulphonates under PTC conditions provides an interesting variant of this reac- 
tion. 9 

Selective removal of a halogen or tosyl group in a bifunctional molecule has 
been effected with lithium aluminium hydride in differing solvent systems. 10

In a suitably equipped 500 ml three-necked flask prepare an ether solution 
(100 ml) of hexylmagnesium bromide from 12g(0.5mol) of magnesium turn- 
ings and 82.5 g (70.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of dry 1-bromohexane using the conditions 
and procedure described in Expt 5.39. When most of the magnesium has dis- 
appeared (about 4 hours) add AnalaR ammonium chloride (27 g) and leave 
the reaction mixture overnight. Cool the flask in ice and add slowly a large 
excess of dilute hydrochloric acid; the precipitate will dissolve completely. 
Separate the upper ethereal layer, and wash it successively with dilute hydro- 
chloric acid and water; dry with magnesium sulphate or anhydrous calcium 
sulphate. Distil the ethereal solution through an efficient fractionating col- 
umn (e.g. a Hempel column filled with 6-mm glass or porcelain rings, or a 30- 
cm all-glass Dufton column; see Figs 2.105(c) and 2.105(a)). After the ether 
has passed over, hexane will distil at 67-70 °C (13-14g, 30-33%). Record the 
i.r. spectrum and compare it with Fig. 3.13(a). The m.s. shows principal frag-

An oven-dried 300-ml flask, equipped with a side-arm fitted with a silicone 
rubber septum, a magnetic stirrer bar, and a reflux condenser connected to a 
mercury bubbler, is cooled to room temperature under a stream of dry nitro- 
gen. Tetrahydrofuran (20 ml) is introduced, followed by 7.1 g (25mmol) of 
cyclooctyl tosylate (1). The mixture is cooled to °C (ice bath). To this stirred 
solution, lithium triethylborohydride (Section 4.2.49, p. 448) [33.3 ml 
(50mmol) of a 1.5 m solution in tetrahydrofuran] is added, and the ice bath 
removed. The mixture is stirred for 2 hours (c. 25 °C). Excess hydride is 
decomposed with water. The organoborane is oxidised with 20 ml of 3 m 
sodium hydroxide solution and 20 ml of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide [(2) 
and (3)]. Then the tetrahydrofuran layer is separated. The aqueous layer is 
extracted with 2 x 20 ml portions of pentane. The combined organic extracts 
are washed with 4 x 15 ml portions of water to remove ethanol produced in 
the oxidation. The organic extract is dried (MgS0 4 ) and volatile solvents 
removed by distillation (2). Distillation of the residue yields 2.27 g (81%) of 
cyclooctane as a colourless liquid, b.p. 142-146 °C, nS 1.4630. 

Notes. (1) A procedure for the preparation of alkyl toluene-p-sulphonates is described 
in Expt 6.46.

hydrogen peroxide (p. 439), and to the distillation of extracts following the use of 
tetrahydrofuran/hydrogen peroxide in oxidation procedures (p. 552).

the organoborane be followed.

5.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



5.1.3 THE REDUCTION OF ALDEHYDES AND KETONES 

One procedure for the conversion of a carbonyl group to a methylene group is 
the Clemmensen reduction, and involves the use of zinc amalgam in the presence 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid. 

R'-CO-R 2 -^* R'-CH 2 -R 2 

This represents a somewhat unusual reduction of a carbonyl group, which might 
be expected to give an alcohol with the metal-acid reducing system (cf. Section 
5.4.1, p. 519). Alcohols are stable to the Clemmensen conditions and are not 
therefore intermediates in the reduction process, which is thought to proceed by 
a mechanism involving the formation of organo-zinc intermediates. A typical 
example is provided by the conversion of heptan-2-one to heptane (Expt 5.5). 

The method is often used for the reduction of aromatic carbonyl compounds 
(see 6.1.1, p. 827) which are reduced in good yield. Here the procedure is modi- 
fied 11 by the addition of a solvent immiscible with hydrochloric acid, i.e. toluene. 

When the Clemmensen method fails, or when strongly acidic conditions are 
precluded owing to the presence of acid-sensitive functional groups, the Wolff- 
Kishner reduction or the Huang-Minion modification of it may succeed. The 
latter method is also discussed in Section 6.1.1, p. 827, and illustrated in Expt 6.4, 
Method A. 

An alternative procedure is to convert the carbonyl compound into the 
toluene-p-sulphonylhydrazone, 12 followed by reduction with either sodium 
borohydride in acetic acid, 13 or with catecholborane, followed by decomposi- 
tion of the intermediate with sodium acetate or tetrabutylammonium acetate. 14 
The former method is illustrated by the conversion of undecan-6-one into 
undecane (Expt 5.6), and the latter by the conversion of acetophenone into 
ethylbenzene (Expt 6.4, Method E). A feature of these methods is that with a, /?- 
unsaturated ketones, migration of the carbon-carbon multiple bond occurs; 
thus the tosylhydrazone of isophorone gives 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohex-l-ene, and 
the tosylhydrazone of oct-3-yn-2-one gives octa-2,3-diene.

Place 100 g (1.53 mol) of zinc wool in a 1-litre three-necked flask and amal- 
gamate it in accordance with Method 1 in Section 4.2.50, p. 467. Fit the flask

tube dipping almost to the bottom of the flask for the introduction of hydro- 
gen chloride gas (compare Figs 4.4 and 2.59); insert an empty wash bottle 
between the hydrogen chloride generator and the flask. Introduce through 
the condenser 250 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 50 ml of water, 
set the stirrer in motion and then add 40 g (0.35 mol) of heptan-4-one (Expt

5.92). Pass a slow current of hydrogen chloride through the mixture; if the 
reaction becomes too vigorous, the passage of hydrogen chloride is tempor- 
arily stopped. After 2-3 hours most of the amalgamated zinc will have 
reacted. Leave the reaction mixture overnight, but disconnect the hydrogen 
chloride gas supply first. Remove the stirrer and the condenser from the flask. 
Arrange for direct steam distillation from the flask by fitting a stopper into 
one neck, a knee tube connected to a downward condenser in the central 
aperture and connect the lead-in tube to a source of steam. Stop the steam 
distillation when the distillate passes over as a clear liquid. Separate the upper 
layer, wash it twice with distilled water, dry with magnesium sulphate or 
anhydrous calcium sulphate and distil through a short fractionating column. 
Collect the fraction, b.p. 97-99 °C (1). The yield of heptane is 26 g (74%). 

Note. (1) The products of most Clemmensen reductions contain small amounts of 
unsaturated hydrocarbons. These can be removed by repeated shaking with 10 per 
cent of the volume of concentrated sulphuric acid until the acid is colourless or nearly 
so; each shaking should be of about 5 minutes duration. The hydrocarbon is washed 
with water, 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution, water (twice), dried with magne- 
sium sulphate or anhydrous calcium sulphate and finally fractionally distilled over 
sodium. 

Cognate preparation. Octane. Use 45 g (0.35 mol) of octan-2-one (Expt 5.86) 
and lOOg of amalgamated zinc. Collect the fraction, b.p. 124-126 °C; the 
yield is 23 g (58%).

To a slurry of undecan-6-one toluene-p-sulphonylhydrazone (5.08 g,

pellets (c. 5.67 g, 150mmol, 24 pellets) (2) at such a rate that foaming is not a 
problem (c. 1 hour). The solution is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour 
and then at 70 °C for 1.5 hours. The solution is then poured into crushed ice, 
made basic with aqueous sodium hydroxide and extracted with three por- 
tions of pentane. The pentane solution is dried and concentrated in a rotary 
evaporator, and the residue distilled at reduced pressure (Kugelrohr appar- 
atus) to obtain 1.96 g (84%) of undecane. Undecane has b.p. 87 °C/20mmHg. 

Notes. (1) The hydrazones are prepared by the following general procedure. 12 The 
carbonyl compound and a 10 per cent molar excess of toluene-p-sulphonylhydrazine 
in absolute ethanol (c. 2 ml per gram of carbonyl compound) are heated on a steam 
bath until a clear solution results (15 minutes). Cooling affords crystalline products in 
good to excellent yields. Recrystallisation is accomplished from ethanol or aqueous 
acetone. For hindered ketones periods of up to 14 hours of reflux are suggested.

5.1.4 COUPLING REACTIONS 

Disconnection at the various carbon-carbon bonds in an alkane molecule will 
give a range of symmetrical and/or unsymmetrical synthons. For example, the 
simple molecule hexane, if disconnected in either a radical or ionic fashion, will 

477 



5.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



give rise to: (i) a one-carbon synthon and a five-carbon synthon; (ii) a two- 
carbon synthon and a four-carbon synthon; and (iii) two equivalent three- 
carbon synthons. Branched chain alkanes offer more numerous possibilities. 

5 Me 

(iii) (ii) (i) 

The synthetic methods described below illustrate the use of various reagent 
equivalents to such synthons which give a good yield of the required product. 

COUPLING REACTIONS USING ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS 

A long established method for the preparation of alkanes involves heating an 
alkyl halide with sodium metal (the Wurtz synthesis). 

2RX + 2Na &gt; R-R + 2NaX 

This type of symmetrical coupling of two molecules of an alkyl halide will 
obviously give better yields than the alternative unsymmetrical coupling process 
which must be used, for example, to make a straight chain alkane having an odd 
number of carbon atoms. 

R J X + R 2 X + 2Na &gt; R^R 2 -!- R^R 1 + R 2 -R 2 + 2NaX 

The symmetrical Wurtz coupling has been found to give particularly good yields 
in the case of the higher alkane homologues. Selected illustrative examples 
(hexane, octane, decane and dodecane) are to be found in Expt 5.7. A related 
reaction is to be found in the synthesis of hexa-l,5-diene {Expt 5.7, cognate prep- 
aration), which illustrates the symmetrical coupling of two molecules of allyl 
iodide by the action of sodium metal. 

'Directed' coupling reactions, where no cross-coupling may occur, requires 
the reagents derived from the appropriate synthons to be ionically different at 
the reactive site. The carbon-carbon coupling reaction to form hept-1-ene (Expt 
5.8), illustrates the importance of selecting the reactive, and readily available, 
allyl bromide (cationic site) with butylmagnesium bromide (anionic site) (A), 
rather than the other alternative (B).

A multistage synthesis which well illustrates the use of Grignard reagents in 
carbon-carbon formation is the synthesis of 7-acetoxyheptanal (7). 15 Retro-

dioxane (8) (see p. 624) prior to the reaction process.

and magnesium turnings in tetrahydrofuran. 16 

Unsymmetrical coupling reactions leading to alkanes can also be achieved by 
the use of copper 'ate' complexes. The organocopper reagents are prepared most 
conveniently by the reaction of 2mol of an organolithium reagent with 1 mol of 
the appropriate copper(i) halide. Reaction of the organocuprate with an alkyl 
halide results in the displacement of halogen by an S N 2 mechanism.

Weigh out 23 g (1 mol) of clean sodium under sodium-dried ether (Section 
4.1 J 5, p. 404), cut it up rapidly into small pieces and introduce the sodium 
quickly into a dry 750- or 1000-ml round-bottomed flask. Fit a dry 30-cm 
double surface condenser (e.g. of the Davies type) into the flask and clamp the 
apparatus so that the flask can be heated on a wire gauze. Weigh out 68.5 g 
(53 ml, 0.5 mol) of butyl bromide (Expt 5.54) previously dried over anhydrous 
sodium sulphate. Introduce about 5 ml of the bromide through the condenser 
into the flask. If no reaction sets in, warm the flask gently with a small lumin- 
ous flame; remove the flame immediately reaction commences (the sodium 
will acquire a blue colour). When the reaction subsides, shake the contents of 
the flask well; this will generally produce further reaction and some of the 
sodium may melt. Add a further 5 ml of butyl bromide, and shake the flask. 
When the reaction has slowed down, repeat the above process until all the 
alkyl bromide has been transferred to the flask (about 1.5 hours). Allow the 
mixture to stand for 1-2 hours. Then add down the condenser by means of a 
dropping funnel 50 ml of rectified spirit dropwise over 1.5 hours, followed by 
50 ml of 50 per cent aqueous ethanol during 30 minutes, and 50 ml of distilled 
water over 15 minutes; shake the flask from time to time. Add 2-3 small 
pieces of porous porcelain and reflux the mixture for 3 hours; any unchanged 
butyl bromide will be hydrolysed. Add a large excess (500-750 ml) of water, 
and separate the upper layer of crude octane (17-18 g). Wash it once with an 
equal volume of water, and dry it with magnesium sulphate. Distil through a 
short fractioning side-arm (cf. Fig. 2.104) and collect the fraction, b.p. 123- 
126°C(15g,52%)(l).

5.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Note. (1) All hydrocarbons prepared by the Wurtz reaction contain small quantities 
of unsaturated hydrocarbons. These may be removed by shaking repeatedly with 10 
per cent of the volume of concentrated sulphuric acid until the acid is no longer 
coloured (or is at most extremely pale yellow); each shaking should be of about 5 
minutes' duration. The hydrocarbon is washed with water, 10 per cent sodium car- 
bonate solution, water (twice), and dried with magnesium sulphate or anhydrous cal- 
cium sulphate. It is then distilled from sodium; two distillations are usually necessary. 

Cognate preparations. Hexane. Use 23 g (lmol) of sodium and 61. 5 g 
(45.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of propyl bromide. It is advisable to employ two efficient 
double surface condensers in series. Collect the fraction, b.p. 68-70 °C (10 g, 
47%). 

Decane. Use 23g (lmol) of sodium and 75. 5g (62ml, 0.5mol) of 1- 
bromopentane (Expt 5.54) or 99 g (65.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of 1-iodopentane (Expt 
5.59). Collect the fraction, b.p. 171-174 °C (28 g, 79%). The i.r. and mass 
spectra are shown in Figs 3.13(b) and 3.79(a) respectively. 

Dodecane. Use 23 g (1 mol) of sodium and 82.5 g (70.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of 1- 
bromohexane (Expt 5.55). Collect the fraction, b.p. 94°C/13mmHg (37 g, 



Hexa-l,5-diene. Place 55 g (2.4 mol) of clean sodium cut into small pieces 
(Section 4.2.65, p. 462) in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask fitted with two 25- 
or 30-cm double surface condensers in series. Weigh out 1 36 g (72 ml, 0.8 mol) 
of freshly distilled allyl iodide, b.p. 99-101 °C (Expt 5.56). Introduce about 
one-quarter of the allyl iodide through the condensers. Warm the flask gently 
until the sodium commences to melt and immediately remove the flame. A 
vigorous reaction sets in and a liquid refluxes in the condensers. Add the re- 
mainder of the allyl iodide in small portions over a period of 2 hours. Allow 
the mixture to cool during 3 hours and arrange the flask for distillation (com- 
pare Fig. 2.98). Distil from an oil bath maintained at 90-100 °C when most of 
the hydrocarbon will pass over; finally raise the temperature of the bath to 
1 50 °C in order to recover the product as completely as possible. Redistil from 
a 50-ml flask with fractionating side arm and containing a little sodium and 
collect the fraction of b.p. 59-50 °C; the yield of hexa-l,5-diene is 26 g (79%).

ide drying tubes into the top of the double surface condenser and of the drop- 
ping funnel. Immerse the flask containing the Grignard reagent in cold water,

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.1 



stir vigorously, and add the allyl bromide at such a rate that the ether boils 
gently; cool momentarily in ice if the reaction becomes too vigorous. It is im- 
portant that the allyl bromide reacts when added, as indicated by gentle boil- 
ing of the solution (2). When all the allyl bromide has been introduced, 
continue stirring for 45 minutes while refluxing gently by immersing the flask 
in a bath of warm water. Allow to cool (3). Pour the reaction mixture 
cautiously on to excess of crushed ice contained in a large beaker. Break up 
the solid magnesium complex and decompose it with ice and dilute sulphuric 
acid or concentrated ammonium sulphate solution. Separate the ether layer, 
wash it with ammoniacal ammonium sulphate solution to remove any dis- 
solved magnesium salts and dry over magnesium sulphate. Distil the dry 
ethereal solution through a fractionating column: after the ether has passed 
over, collect the hept-1-ene at 93-95 °C. The yield is 29 g (71%). 

Notes. (1) Solid magnesium must be absent to avoid the formation of biallyl via allyl 
magnesium bromide; the insertion of a short plug of glass wool effectively removes 
any finely divided magnesium or alternatively use a tube terminating in a glass frit. 

(2) If reaction does not occur when a little allyl bromide is first introduced, further 
addition must be discontinued until the reaction has commenced. Remove 2-3 ml of 
the Grignard solution with a dropper pipette, add about 0.5 ml of allyl bromide and 
warm gently to start the reaction; after this has reacted well, add the solution to the 
main portion of the Grignard reagent. 

(3) A slight excess of Grignard reagent should be present at this stage. Test for the 
presence of the reagent as follows. Remove 0.5 ml of the clear liquid with a dropper 
pipette and add 0.5 ml of a 1 per cent solution of Michler's ketone [4,4'-bis(dimethyl- 
amino)benzophenone] in benzene, followed by 1 ml of water and 3-4 drops of 0.01 M 
iodine in glacial acetic acid; shake. A greenish-blue colour results if a Grignard reagent 
is present. In the absence of iodine, the colour fades. A dye of the diphenylmethane 
type is produced.

from 2-(2-bromoethyl)-l,3-dioxane 16b (12.19g, 62.5 mmol) in 50ml of tetra- 
hydrofuran, is added dropwise to the cooled solution. This is stirred at 
— 80 °C for 30 minutes, slowly raised to reflux temperature over a 2-hour 
period, and then heated at reflux for 6 hours. The tetrahydrofuran is removed 
by rotary evaporation and the residue poured into aqueous ammonia/ 
ammonium chloride solution (800 ml). The product is extracted with ether 
(3 x 50 ml), dried with magnesium sulphate and distilled. A small amount of 
l-acetoxy-4-iodobutane is recovered, and then the product is obtained in a 
yield of 8.86 g (77%), b.p. 90-100 °C/0.3 mmHg. 

7-Acetoxyheptanal. 2-(6-Acetoxyhexyl)-l,3-dioxane (4.60 g, 20.0 mmol), 
methanol (150 ml), glacial acetic acid (35 ml) and concentrated hydrochloric 
acid (1 ml) are stirred and left to stand for 3 days. This mixture is poured 
cautiously into saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (500 ml) and 
the product extracted with ether (3 x 200 ml). The extract is dried with mag- 
nesium sulphate and evaporated to give the crude dimethyl acetal, which is 
then dissolved in glacial acetic acid (100ml), water (10ml) and hydrochloric 
acid (1 ml) and left to stand for 3 days. The solution is poured cautiously into 
saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (1 litre), made basic with 
additional sodium hydrogen carbonate, and the product extracted with ether 
(3 x 50 ml). The extract is dried with magnesium sulphate, evaporated and 
the residue distilled to give the product, yield 3.10 g (90%), b.p. 93-98 °C/ 
0.7 mmHg. 

Notes. (1) The editors suggest that the apparatus consists of a 100-ml two-necked 
flask fitted with a silicone rubber septum into which is inserted a syringe needle con- 
nected to a nitrogen feed (Section 2.17.8, p. 120) and through which the reagents may 
be syringe-injected; the second arm of the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser the 
outlet of which is connected to a mercury bubbler. 

(2) The Grignard reagent is prepared by the following procedure 16 * with suitable 
adjustment of the quantities of reagents employed. A 50-ml flask is equipped with a 
reflux condenser, a nitrogen atmosphere and magnetic stirring. In it are placed magne- 
sium turnings (0.97 g, 40 mmol), dry tetrahydrofuran (25 ml) and 2-(2-bromoethyl)- 
l,3-dioxane 16b (5.85, 30 mmol) (or from Aldrich). This is heated to reflux and the heat 
immediately removed. The exothermic reaction is moderated at reflux by the occa- 
sional application of an ice bath. After 10 minutes, heat is applied to maintain reflux- 
ing for an additional 10 minutes. After cooling to room temperature the solution is 
drawn up into a 50-ml syringe leaving excess magnesium behind.

Place 9.53 g (0.05 mol) of copper(i) iodide in a two-necked, 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask containing a glass-covered magnetic follower bar. Fit a 
rubber septum to one of the necks of the flask and connect the other neck to 
one arm of a three-way stopcock. Connect the second arm of the stopcock to 
a supply of dry, oxygen-free nitrogen (cf. Fig. 2.77) and the remaining arm to 
a vacuum pump. Evacuate the flask by opening the stopcock to the vacuum 
pump(l) and then, with a rapid stream of nitrogen flowing, carefully open the 
stopcock to the nitrogen supply to fill the flask with nitrogen. Repeat this 
process twice; flame the flask gently on the final occasion it is evacuated. 
Maintain a static atmosphere of nitrogen in the flask throughout the reaction 
by passing a slow stream of nitrogen through the nitrogen line. Cool the flask 
in an acetone/Cardice bath and transfer 100 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran (2) to 
the flask via the septum using a hypodermic syringe (3). Stir the cooled 
( — 78 °C) suspension and add 52.0 ml of a 1.92 molar solution of butyllithium 
in hexane (4) from a hypodermic syringe. Stir the flask solution at — 78 °C for 
1 hour, and then add a solution of 3.39 g (0.01 5 mol) of 1 -iodoheptane (Expt 
5.60) in 10 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran dropwise from the syringe. Stir the solu- 
tion at -78 °C for 1 hour and then at °C (ice bath) for a further 2 hours ((5) 
and (6)). Hydrolyse the reaction mixture by pouring it carefully into 100 ml of 
1 m hydrochloric acid. Separate the upper organic layer and extract the 
aqueous layer with two 50 ml portions of pentane. Wash the combined 
organic layers with water (50 ml), dry over magnesium sulphate and evapor- 
ate the solvents on the rotary evaporator. Distil the residue at atmospheric 
pressure using a semimicro scale distillation unit fitted with a short fractio- 
nating side-arm packed with glass helices (cf. Fig. 2.111). Undecane has b.p. 
194-197 °C; the yield is 1.24g (53%). 

Notes. (1) This operation should be carried out behind a safety screen. 

(2) Tetrahydrofuran should be freshly distilled from lithium aluminium hydride. It is 
convenient to store a supply of peroxide-free tetrahydrofuran (Section 4.2.19, p. 406) 
under nitrogen over lithium aluminium hydride and distil appropriate quantities as 
required. 

(3) The syringes and long flexible needles can be obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. 

(4) Solutions of butyllithium, and other lithium reagents, may be purchased from 
Aldrich. See Section 4.2.47, p. 442 for notes on the storage, handling and analysis of 
alkyllithium reagents. 

(5) The progress of the reaction may be conveniently followed by g.l.c. Remove 
samples (c. 2-3 ml) from the reaction mixture by means of a hypodermic syringe and 
submit them to a small-scale hydrolysis and extraction procedure similar to that 
described for the main reaction mixture. Analyse the organic layer on a 10 per cent 
squalane on Chromosorb W column held at 140 °C. Under these conditions 1-iodo- 
heptane has a slightly longer retention time than undecane. 

(6) Complete reaction of the alkyllithium can be tested by means of the Gilman test 
described in Expt 5.8, Note (3).

5.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ANODIC COUPLING REACTIONS 

The synthesis of alkanes which involves the electrolysis of salts of carboxylic 
acids was first reported by Kolbe in 1849. The technique and the apparatus has 
been described in Section 2.17.6, p. 115, and the illustrative example relevant to 
this section is that of the preparation of hexacosane (the experimental details 
were originally supplied by Dr R. P. Linstead, C.B.E., F.R.S.). (See also Section 
5.11.5, p. 677). 

Experiment 5.11 HEXACOSANE 

2CH 3 -(CH 2 ) I2 -C0 2 e -=^&gt; C 26 H 54 + 2C0 2 

Dissolve 5.0 g of pure myristic acid (tetradecanoic acid) in 25 ml of absolute 
methanol to which 0.1 g of sodium has been added. Place the solution in a 
cylindrical cell (25 cm long, 3 cm diameter) provided with two platinum plate 
electrodes (2.5 x 2.5 cm) set 1-2 mm apart (cf. Section 2.17.6, p. 115). Electro- 
lyse at about 1 amp until the electrolyte is just alkaline (pH 7.5-8). Cool the 
cell in an ice bath during the electrolysis. Reverse the current from time to 
time; this will help to dislodge the coating of insoluble by-products on the 
electrodes. Neutralise the cell contents by adding a few drops of glacial acetic 
acid, and evaporate most of the solvent under reduced pressure using a rotary 
evaporator. Pour the residue into the water and extract the crude product 
with ether. Wash the ethereal solution with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, 
dry (magnesium sulphate) and evaporate the solvent. Recrystallise the resi- 
due from light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C). The yield of hexacosane, m.p. 57- 
58°Cis2.4g(65%). 

5.2 ALKENES 

The location of a carbon-carbon double bond in the carbon chain of a mono- 
alkene may be terminal (R-CH=CH 2 ) or non-terminal (R-CH=CH-R). With 
non -terminal alkenes the possibility of (£)/(Z) geometric isomerism is present in 
disubstituted alkenes (e.g. R*CH=CH*R, where the two alkyl substituents may 
be the same or different), and may be present in trisubstituted alkenes (e.g. 
R 1 R 2 CH=CH-R 1 ) and tetrasubstituted alkenes (e.g. R 1 R 2 C=CR 1 R 2 or 
R 1 R 2 C=CR 3 R 4 ) according to the nature of the alkyl group. The location of 
two or more double bonds (dienes, trienes, etc.) in a carbon chain may be remote 
(isolated) (e.g. Me-CH=CH-CH 2 -CH=CH-Me, hepta-2,5-diene), conjugated 
(e.g. Me-CH=CH-CH=CH-Et, hepta-2,4-diene), or cumulative (e.g. 
Me-CH=C=C(Me)-Et, 4-methylhexa-2,3-diene). With isolated and conjugated 
dienes various combinations of (£)/(Z) isomerism are possible as shown below: 

Hepta-2,5-diene

Suitably substituted cumulative dienes (the allenes) have a chiral axis result-

example in the instance below:

The construction of models emphasises all these stereoisomeric features; also 
note that in a homologous sequence of cumulative polyenes, the presence of a 
chiral axis, or of geometric isomerism, alternates [i.e. diene (R/S), triene (E/Z), 
tetraene (R/S), etc.] 

The introduction of a carbon-carbon double bond into a molecule may be 
effected by the following typical procedures. 

1. 1,2-Elimination processes {^-elimination) {Expts 5.12 to 5.15). 

2. The partial hydrogenation of alkynes (Expt 5.16). 

3. Wittig and related reactions (Expts 5.17 to 5.20). 

4. Selected rearrangements of alkynes to allenes (Expts 5.21 and 5.22).

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

In addition to alkyl group absorption, the characteristic i.r. absorption bands of 
monoalkenes are in the region just above 3000 cm ~ ! and in the region of 1000- 
800 cm" ! , due to the stretching and out-of-plane bending vibrations respectively 
of the sp 2 -carbon-hydrogen bond. Frequently the substitution pattern and geo- 
metrical isomerism may be ascertained from inspection of this latter region 
(p. 277). An absorption band arising from the carbon-carbon double bond 
stretching vibration occurs in the region of 1680-1620 cm -1 . The spectrum of 
oct-1-ene (Fig. 3.14) illustrates these features. The protons attached to the un- 
saturated carbons are deshielded and resonate in the p.m.r. spectra at low fields 
(3 5.00-6.00); illustrative spectra are provided for styrene (Fig. 3.62) and croton- 
aldehyde (Figs 3.72 and 3.73). If these protons have sufficiently different chem- 
ical shift values for their coupling constants to be measured, geometric 
configuration, if appropriate, may be assigned. The l3 C-n.m.r. spectrum of hex- 
1-ene is shown in Fig. 3.51. The interpretation of the fragmentation pattern in 
the m.s. of alkenes is discussed on p. 374. Conjugated and cumulative alkenes 
absorb in the accessible region of the u.v.-visible spectrum, and the number of 
double bonds present may often be deduced from the positions of the absorption 
maxima (p. 388). 

5.2.1 1,2 ELIMINATION PROCESSES (/-ELIMINATION) 

Many convenient methods for the introduction of carbon-carbon double bonds 
into a saturated carbon chain involve the removal of two atoms or groups from 
adjacent carbon atoms. Usually, but not invariably, one of these groups is 
hydrogen (i.e. the removal of HX). Two main types of elimination reactions are 
recognised - heterolytic processes in solution and pyrolytic reactions in the gas 
phase. A detailed discussion of the mechanisms of these reactions may be found 
in all standard and advanced textbooks; in each of the reactions discussed below 
the probable mechanism is noted in relation to the aim of obtaining good yields 
of regio- or stereoisomerically pure compounds.

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.2 



THE DEHYDRATION OF ALCOHOLS 

This dehydration proceeds under acidic conditions and is a widely used olefin- 
forming reaction. In the laboratory phosphoric acid is the reagent of choice; sul- 
phuric acid, which is often used, can lead to extensive charring and oxidation 
and hence to lower yields of alkene. Other reagents include potassium hydrogen 
sulphate and anhydrous copper(n) sulphate. 17 Passage over heated alumina is 
also effective. 

Tertiary alcohols undergo elimination the more readily, and most certainly 
by an El process.

In the preparative example of the dehydration of 2-methylbutan-2-ol 
[Me2C(OH)'CH 2 - Me], the loss of a proton from the intermediate carbocation 
(2) may take place from either of the two adjacent positions giving a mixture of 
regioisomers, 2-methylbut-2-ene (3) and 2-methylbut-l-ene (1) (Expt 5.12).

The most highly substituted (and hence the thermodynamically more stable) 
alkene is formed preferentially (Saytzeff rule); in this case the ratio of products, 
(3):(1), is 4:1 (g.l.c analysis). Application of the reaction sequence to the ali- 
phatic tertiary alcohols prepared in Expts 5.41 and 5.42 will reveal which alco- 
hol gives a mixture of regioisomers and which will give a single alkene. In 
predicting these product compositions, due attention should be paid to the pos- 
sibilities of stereoisomers [(E)/(Z)~] being formed. Those cases where a mixture 
of regio- and stereoisomers of similar stability is obtained are clearly of less pre- 
parative value. 

The dehydration of ditertiary alcohols in the presence of hydrobromic acid 
may lead to dienes (e.g. pinacol to 2,3-dimethylbuta-l,3-diene, cognate prepara- 
tion in Expt 5.12), although in this case some concomitant rearrangement to 
t-butyl methyl ketone (pinacolone, Expt 5.98) occurs under the acidic conditions 
employed. 

HBr 

Me 2 C(OH)-C(OH)Me 2 ► CH 2 =C(Me)-C(Me)=CH 2 + Bu'-CO-Me 

The dehydration of primary or secondary alcohols, when proceeding via a 
secondary or primary carbocation respectively (i.e. the El pathway), may be pre- 
paratively less satisfactory owing to intramolecular rearrangements involving a 
hydrogen or an alkyl group. The driving force for such rearrangements is of 
course the relative thermodynamic stability of the carbocations (t &gt; s &gt; p, cf. 
p. 829). This would give rise to a greater complexity of possible products. With 
primary alcohols and sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid, the corresponding 
intermediate esters are formed, from which ethers result due to a competing sub- 
stitution pathway (Section 5.6.1, p. 581). 

487 



5.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



One useful example is the dehydration of the secondary alcohol 2-methyl- 
cyclohexanol, which yields a mixture of two regioisomers in which the more 
highly substituted alkene predominates; in this case the mixture may be separ- 
ated by careful fractional distillation (cognate preparation in Expt 5.12). 





THE DEHYDROHALOGENATION OF ALKYL HALIDES 

The removal of a molecule of a hydrogen halide from an alkyl halide to yield an 
alkene is effected under strongly basic conditions, e.g. a concentrated alcoholic 
solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide or alkoxide. This overall reaction 
has been submitted to most rigorous mechanistic studies. Most of the factors 
(temperature, nature of base, structure of substrate, solvent, etc.) which control 
product composition have been evaluated. It thus appears that under the con- 
ditions noted above, an E2 process, in which the participating sites adopt an 
anfi-periplanar conformation leading to an ant i-elimination process, is generally 
favoured.

The complexity of the mixture of regio- and stereoisomers of alkenes which may

It is clear therefore that this preparative procedure may only be of value for the 
formation of a restricted range of alkene target molecules. Recent procedures in- 
clude the use of the non-nucleophilic base, l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4,0]undec-7-ene 
(DBU), 18 and the use of PTC methods. 19 One useful example is provided by the 
ready conversion of 3-bromocyclohexene (Expt 5.68) into cyclohexa-l,3-diene 
(Expt 5.13) where the base employed is quinoline. 

The dehydrohalogenation of 1,2- (and 1,1-) dihalides leads to the introduc- 
tion of a triple bond into a molecule (Section 5.3.1, p. 509).

The reaction has been extensively used for the determination of the structure of 
naturally occurring bases (e.g. the alkaloids). However it has rather limited pre- 
parative value, even though the elimination reaction occurs without any re- 
arrangement of the carbon skeleton, and the regioisomer which predominates in 
the product is the less highly substituted alkene (Hofmann rule; contrast the 
Saytzeff rule). Such alkenes are now more usually prepared by other procedures 
noted below. 

PYROLYSIS OF ACETATE AND XANTHATE ESTERS 

Two examples are provided of these pyrolytic eliminations, both of which pro 1 
ceed by a similar mechanistic pathway which is classified as a syn-elimination 
process.

The advantage of these methods is that although somewhat high temperatures 
are employed, the product is not usually contaminated by compounds arising 
from double bond migration or from skeletal rearrangement. For example the 
thermal decomposition of 0-[l,l,2-trimethylpropyl] S-methyldithiocarbonate 
(Expt 5.209) gives a satisfactory yield of 3,3-dimethylbut-l-ene (Expt 5.15). This 
product is homogeneous by g.l.c. analysis and the i.r. spectrum clearly confirms 
the unrearranged skeletal structure. In contrast, the acid-catalysed dehydration 
of the corresponding alcohol, proceeding by way of an El mechanism and a 
carbocation intermediate, would inevitably result in rearrangement and forma- 
tion of 2,3-dimethylbut-2-ene as the main product.

Acetate pyrolysis is illustrated by the synthesis of penta-l,4-diene (Expt 5.14) 
from 1,5-diacetoxypentane. This is prepared from 5-chloropentyl acetate which 
is conveniently obtained from tetrahydropyran by treatment with acetyl chlor- 
ide; this ring-opening reaction offers interesting comparison with the methods 
for the preparation of a, co-dihalides discussed in Section 5.5.1, p. 555. 

The pyrolysis of N-oxides to yield alkenes proceeds at lower temperatures

Place 25.0 g (31ml, 0.28 mol) of 2-methylbutan-2-ol and 10 ml of 85 per cent 
orthophosphoric acid in a 100-ml, round-bottomed flask and swirl to mix 
thoroughly. Fit the flask with a 20-cm fractionating column filled with glass 
helices, a Claisen still-head and a condenser leading to a 50-ml receiving flask 
cooled in a beaker of iced water (Fig. 2.104). Add a few pieces of porous por- 
celain and heat the reaction mixture gently with a Bunsen burner. Collect the 
alkene fraction which distils in the range 35-38 °C during a period of 30 
minutes. Dry the distillate with l-2g of magnesium sulphate. Wash and dry 
the distillation apparatus, decant the dried distillate into a 50-ml flask and 
redistil in the reassembled apparatus. Collect the fraction boiling at 37-38 °C; 
the yield is 12.5 g (64%). Record the infrared spectrum of the product using a 
fixed path-length cell (0.025 mm). The stretching bands of the terminal 
(1645cm -1 ) and non-terminal (1670cm -1 ) carbon-carbon double bonds 
can both be observed; bands at 890 and 805 cm -1 (=C — H deformation) 
also establish the presence of both terminal and non-terminal olefinic 
systems. Analyse the product by g.l.c. on a Silicone oil column at 30 °C; 2- 
methylbut-1-ene appears first, closely followed by 2-methylbut-2-ene; the 
areas under the peaks are in the ratio of 1:4. 

Cognate preparations. 2,3-Dimethylbuta-l^-diene. In a 1 -litre round- 
bottomed flask, surmounted by an efficient fractionating column (e.g. one of 
the Hempel type, see Section 2.26) place 177 g (1.5 mol) of anhydrous pinacol 
(Expt 5.35), 5 ml of constant boiling point hydrobromic acid (c. 47-48% w/w 
HBr) and a few fragments of porous porcelain. Attach a condenser and a 
receiver to the column. Heat the flask gently in an oil bath; the rate of distilla- 
tion should be 20-30 drops per minute. Collect the distillate until the temper- 
ature at the top of the column is 95 °C (60-70 minutes). Separate the upper 
non-aqueous layer, wash it twice with 50 ml portions of water, add 0.25 g of 
hydroquinone as an inhibitor and dry it overnight with 7-8 g of anhydrous 
calcium chloride. Transfer to a 500-ml flask and distil through the same col-

(7 g); and (c) 105-106 °C (35 g). Fraction (a) is pure dimethylbutadiene (yield 
57%), (b) is an intermediate fraction and (c) is pinacolone.

Dimethylbutadiene may be kept for a limited period in an ice box or in a

Cyclohexene. Fit a 500-ml three-necked flask with a fractionating column 
(e.g. a Hempel column filled with 6-mm glass or porcelain rings) carrying a 
thermometer at its upper end, and a separatory funnel; close the third neck 
with a stopper. Attach an efficient double surface condenser to the column; 
use a filter flask, cooled in ice, as receiver. Place 50 g of 85 per cent ortho- 
phosphoric acid in the flask and heat it in an oil bath at 160-1 70 °C. Add, 
through the funnel, 250 g (2.5 mol) of cyclohexanol over a period of 1.5-2 
hours. When all the cyclohexanol has been introduced, raise the temperature 
of the bath to about 200 °C and maintain it at this temperature for 20-30 
minutes. The temperature at the top of the column should not rise above 
90 °C. Saturate the distillate with salt, separate the upper layer and dry it with 
magnesium sulphate. Distil the crude cyclohexene through an efficient col- 
umn and collect the fraction boiling at 81-83 °C; the residue is largely cyclo- 
hexanol. The yield of cyclohexene is 1 65 g (80%). 

1-Methylcyclohexene. Use 20 g (0.18 mol) of 2-methylcyclohexanol and 5 ml 
of phosphoric acid. Proceed as for 2-methylbut-2-ene but use a shorter frac- 
tionating column (12 cm); it is not necessary to cool the receiving flask. 
Collect the fraction boiling between 100 and 1 12 °C and dry and redistil using 
a simple distillation apparatus. Collect the purified alkene fraction boiling at 
103-1 10 °C; the yield is 14.2 g (76%). Analyse the product by g.l.c. on a Sili- 
cone oil column at 60 °C (Section 2.31); 3-methylcyclohexene (20%) appears 
first followed by 1-methylcyclohexene (80%). The major product, 1-methyl- 
cyclohexene, b.p. 110°C, can be separated from the 3-methyl isomer, b.p. 
103 °C, by careful fractionation through a spinning band column (Fig. 2.107).

1,5-Diacetoxypentane. Equip a 5-litre three-necked flask with an efficient 
sealed stirrer unit of the Hirschberg type, a double-surface reflux condenser 
and screw-capped adapter carrying a thermometer. Add 516g (582 ml, 
6.0 mol) of tetrahydropyran, 480 g (434 ml, 6.0 mol) of acetyl chloride and 4g 
of powdered fused zinc chloride. Heat the mixture with a heating mantle with 
vigorous stirring under reflux, and continue to heat until the temperature of 
the reaction mixture reaches 150°C (about 3-5 hours). Allow the reaction 
mixture to cool to near room temperature and add 980 g (10 mol) of solid 
potassium acetate and 20 g of sodium iodide. Heat the mixture again with 
stirring to 160 °C and maintain the temperature for 12 hours. Cool to room 
temperature, add 1 litre of light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C), filter under suction 
and wash the residue thoroughly with more light petroleum. Combine the 
filtrate and washings and remove the solvent on a rotary evaporator. 
Fractionally distil the residue under reduced pressure and collect the 1,5- 
diacetoxypentane at 108-1 14 °C/3.5-4 mmHg. The yield is about 790 g (70%); 
the product is sufficiently pure for use in the next stage, but a sample may be 
purified by redistillation and then has b.p. 102-104 °C/3 mmHg (or 92-94 °C/

supply to the condenser to be cooled in an ice-salt bath. Heat the xanthate 
ester to boiling using a Bunsen burner; smooth decomposition occurs 
forming the alkene which slowly distils. On completion of the pyrolysis wash 
the distillate with three 10 ml portions of ice-cold 20 per cent potassium

5.2.2 THE PARTIAL HYDROGENATION OF ALKYNES 

Alkynes readily undergo catalytic hydrogenation to yield first the corresponding 
alkene and then the alkane. 

R'-C=C-R 2 * R 1 -CH=CH-R 2 &gt; R^CHj-CrVR 2 

With most hydrogenation catalysts of the platinum and nickel groups (Sections 
4.2.67, p. 459 and 4.2.50, p. 450), a mixture of products is obtained even if an 
attempt is made to stop the reaction at the half-way stage. An alkene may only 
be obtained in good yield if particular attention is paid to the selection of a de- 
activated hydrogenation catalyst. An early, highly effective formulation of a de- 
activated palladium catalyst is Lindlar's catalyst (Section 4.2.54, p. 453), but 
palladium-on-barium sulphate in the presence of quinoline, or palladium-on- 
calcium carbonate, is also recommended. In these cases it is advisable to 

493 



5.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



monitor the rate of hydrogenation when it will be noted that the reaction slows 
significantly after the uptake of one molar proportion of hydrogen. 

The partial hydrogenation process is stereospecific, s_yn-addition of hydrogen 
leading to the (Z)-alkene in a virtually stereochemically pure form. The reaction 
is illustrated by the conversion of but-2-ynoic acid into (Z)-but-2-enoic acid 
using the Lindlar catalyst (Expt 5.16); g.l.c. analysis shows the crude product to 
be 95 per cent stereochemically pure, the remainder being the (£)-isomer. The 
first cognate preparation in Expt 5.16 illustrates the use of a palladium-on- 
barium sulphate catalyst for the partial hydrogenation of but-2-yn-l-ol to give 
the corresponding (Z)-alkenol. 23 In the second cognate preparation, but-2-yne- 
1,4-diol is hydrogenated with a palladium-on-calcium carbonate catalyst. 24 

Although these catalytic partial hydrogenations of alkynes may well be 
regarded as the procedure of choice for (Z)-alkenes, 25 other catalytic systems 
have been explored. These include a sodium hydride-sodium alkoxide-nickel(n) 
acetate reagent, 26 and a sodium borohydride-palladium chloride-polyethylene 
glycol system. 27 Diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) has also been used for 
the conversion of alkynes into (Z)-alkenes. 28 (£)-Alkenes are formed when the 
internal triple bond is reduced with sodium in liquid ammonia. 29

In a 250-ml hydrogenation flask (Section 2.17.1, p. 89) place lOOmg of Lind- 
lar catalyst (1) and a solution of 2g (0.024 mol) of but-2-ynoic acid (Expt 
5.216) in 100 ml of ethanol. Attach the flask to the adapter of the atmospheric 
hydrogenation apparatus [Fig. 2.65(a)], and fill the flask and gas burettes 
with hydrogen by the procedure discussed in Section 2.17.1, p. 89; note the 
volumes in the gas burettes. Agitate the flask and note the burette readings 
when uptake of hydrogen practically ceases (the volume of hydrogen 
absorbed should be in the region of 540 ml). Follow the procedure given in 
Section 2.17.1, p. 89 for replacing the hydrogen in the apparatus with air. 
Disconnect the hydrogenation flask, and filter the solution to remove the 
catalyst which should then be transferred to a residue bottle. Evaporate the 
ethanol on a rotary evaporator; a white solid is obtained if the temperature of 
the flask is below 15 °C. Gas-liquid chromatography analysis (using a 1.5 m 
column of 10 per cent diisodecyl phthalate containing 1 per cent phosphoric 
acid on Chromosorb W held at 90 °C with a nitrogen flow rate of 20 ml per 
minute) of a solution of the acid in ether shows the crude product to contain 
95 per cent of (Z)-but-2-enoic acid (2). The pure acid, m.p. 1 5 °C, may be 
obtained by low temperature recrystallisation (Section 2.20) using light 
petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C). The p.m.r. spectrum should be recorded and com- 
pared with that of crotonic acid (Expt 5.216). 

Notes. (1) See Section 4.2.54, p. 453; a suitable preparation is available from, for 
example, Fluka-A.G. or Aldrich. 

(2) Under these conditions isomerisation to the more stable (£) isomer is not appar- 
ent. The retention times for (Z)-but-2-enoic acid, (£)-but-2-enoic acid and but-2-ynoic 
acid are 6.8, 10.0 and 19.8 minutes respectively.

palladium-on-barium sulphate (260 mg) poisoned with synthetic quinoline

of hydrogen (5650 ml) will be absorbed. The catalyst is then separated and the 
filtrate distilled, giving (Z)-but-2-ene-l,4-diol as a colourless oil (15.7 g, 77%), 
b.p. 134-135 °C/15mmHg, n" 1.4716. The product forms a dibenzoate 
(prisms from aqueous methanol), m.p. 69-70 °C. 

5.2.3 THE WITTIG AND RELATED REACTIONS 

Quaternisation of triphenylphosphine with an alkyl halide gives a quaternary 
phosphonium halide (4) which under the influence of a strong base eliminates 
hydrogen halide to give an alkylidenephosphorane [(5), an ylide]. The latter 
reacts with an aldehyde or ketone to give first an intermediate betaine (6), which 
rearranges to the oxaphosphetane (7), which then under the reaction conditions 
eliminates triphenylphosphine oxide to form an alkene.

The overall sequence is the Wittig reaction, and its great value lies in the fact that 
the mild conditions do not normally promote structural isomerisation; for this 
reason alkenes of unambiguous structure may be synthesised. 

Since its discovery in 1953, the reaction has been extensively studied with 
respect to structural variation in the phosphonium ylide, in the range of func- 
tionalised aldehydes and ketones, in the nature of the bases and the polarity of 
the solvents that may be used, and in the mechanism of the reaction and the fac- 
tors which influence the (E/Z) ratio. Many thousands of simple and complex 
syntheses have been effected and the method is widely exploited in research 
laboratories and in the industrial processes for syntheses in the steroid and 
carotenoid field. 

The preparative examples which are discussed below, and elsewhere in the 
text, have been selected to illustrate some of the considerations needed in the 

495 



5.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



selection of starting materials, and some of the experimental conditions of the 
reaction that have been employed. 

A retrosynthetic analysis for the alkene R 1 R 2 C=CH , R 3 shows two possible 
carbonyl compounds as starting materials.

In the synthesis of methylenecyclohexane (Expt 5.17), route B using cyclohexa- 
none and methylenetriphenylphosphorane (R'=H) is preferred, since the car- 
bonyl compound of route A, formaldehyde (R 3 =H), is more difficult to handle, 
even though no difficulty would be envisaged with the formation of cyclohexyl- 
idenetriphenylphosphorane. In other cases the relative availability of the 
carbonyl compounds and haloalkanes would need to be considered. Since the 
alkylidenetriphenylphosphoranes have high carbanionic reactivity they rapidly 
interact with oxygen and water. These reactions are therefore carried out under 
nitrogen and under anhydrous conditions; strong bases such as the methyl- 
sulphinyl carbanion (Me-SOCHf) generated from dimethyl sulphoxide with 
sodium hydride, or butyllithium or phenyllithium (e.g. cognate preparation) are 
used. e e 

In the case of phosphonium salts having the structure Ph 3 P-CHR 1 R 2 X, 
where R 1 and R 2 contain electron-withdrawing and mesomerically stabilising 
groups (e.g. Ar, C0 2 R, CO, C=C), the derived carbanion is more stable, more 
tolerant of water, and may be formed with less strong bases. Hence sodium 
alkoxides, sodium hydroxide, or even sodium carbonate may be used. However 
such carbanions have lower carbanionic reactivity, and although reacting 
readily with aldehydes, ketones are frequently not attacked. An example of the 
use of sodium hydroxide as the base is provided by the conversion of 9-anthral- 
dehyde into (£)-l-(9-anthryl)-2-phenylethene by reaction with benzyltriphenyl- 
phosphonium bromide 30 (Expt 5.18). The reactivity of the ylide towards ketones 
may be improved upon by preparing a Wittig-type reagent by reacting triethyl 
phosphite with the relevant halide and treating the resulting alkyl phosphonate 
with base (Horner-Emmons or Wadsworth-Emmons reaction)} 1

Examples of this reaction are to be found in Sections 5.18.2, p. 798 and 5.18.3, 
p. 804 for the synthesis of unsaturated carbonyl compounds and unsaturated 
esters. 

In the above discussion the problem of stereoisomeric control has been set 
aside. Total stereoisomeric purity is in fact difficult to achieve, and extensive 
mechanistic studies have been carried out to elucidate the factors which in- 
fluence the (E/Z) ratio. It thus appears that, in the formation of the alkene 
R I, CH=CH*R 2 , thermodynamic control leading to predominance of the (£)- 
isomer is promoted by elevated temperatures, apolar solvents, stabilising salts 
(lithium or sodium halides), carbanion stabilisation, an electron-rich phos- 
phorus atom [ — PO(OR) 2 ], and excess base. On the other hand, kinetic control 
leading to a predominance of the (Z)-isomer, is promoted by low temperatures, 

496 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.2 



polar (aprotic) solvents, salt-free solutions, no carbanion stabilisation, and an 
electrophilic phosphorus atom (PPh 3 ). 32 

A further structural variation in the phosphorus ylide was developed in the 
Wittig-Horner reaction. 33 Here the anion-stabilising group is the diphenyl- 
phosphinoyl group (Ph 2 PO), and the anion is derived from the alkyl (or aralkyl) 
diphenylphosphine oxide (Ph 2 P(0)-CH 2 R). These compounds are formed by 
the hydrolysis of the corresponding phosphonium halide with aqueous alkali. 

Ph,P + R-CH 2 X &gt; Ph,P-CH 2 -R -^-* Ph 2 P(0)-CH 2 -R + PhH 

Taking a simple general example to explain the usefulness of this reaction, treat- 
ment with base (usually butyllithium) of the alkyldiphenylphosphine oxide 
gives the anion which then reacts with an aldehyde to form the corresponding- 
erythw.threo diastereoisomeric mixture of alcohols (cf. p. 517) in unequal pro- 
portions; only one enantiomer of each diastereoisomeric pair is formulated [(8) 
and (9)].

These alcohols, unlike the betaine-oxaphosphetane intermediates of the Wittig 
reaction, may usually be isolated in a stable crystalline form, and the diastereo- 
isomers are frequently separable by chromatography. The erythro-threo pro- 
portion is greatly biased in favour of the eryt/iro-isomer. Conversion into the 
alkenes is then effected by reaction with sodium hydride in dimethylformamide 
which proceeds by a s_yn-elimination of the water-soluble Ph 2 POf species, 
probably via a four-membered cyclic transition state similar to the correspond- 
ing Wittig reaction. 34 Thus the eryf/iro-alcohol (8) gives the (Z)-alkene and the 
f/ireo-alcohol (9) gives the (£)-alkene; owing to the eryf/iro-selectivity in alcohol 
formation and chromatographic separability of diastereoisomers, the overall 
reaction sequence provides a preparatively useful route to (Z)-alkenes.

An alternative route to the erythrouhreo diastereoisomeric mixture of alcohols 
results from the acylation of the alkyldiphenylphosphine oxide with an ester or 
lactone to yield the /?-ketophosphine oxide, followed by reduction with sodium 
borohydride. This reduction shows f/ireo-selectivity, so that, following separa- 
tion of the diastereoisomers, a preparatively useful route to (£)-alkenes is 
achieved.

The illustrative example (Expt 5.19) of these two complementary routes is the

The Peterson reaction may be regarded as the silicon-based analogue of the 
Wittig reaction. 36 In the simplest and earliest examples, trimethylsilylmethyl- 
magnesium chloride (Me 3 Si'CH 2 MgCl, a source of a-silylcarbanion), was 
allowed to react with a carbonyl compound to give a /?-silylalcohol (10). Sub- 
sequently the alcohol was converted into the oxyanion with either sodium 
hydride or sodium hydroxide which decomposes in refluxing tetrahydrofuran to 
the alkene by a syn-elimination process.

The final elimination step may also be effected under acidic conditions, but the 
possibility of rearrangement to other alkene regioisomers makes this a less satis- 
factory procedure. The scope of this reaction, which was initially of particular 
value for the preparation of terminal alkenes, has been increased by the develop- 
ment of other methods for the preparation of a-silylcarbanions. 37 

In the preparation of 2,6-dimethylhepta-l,5-diene, Expt 5.20, the final in situ 
elimination step is effected with thionyl chloride and is thought to proceed via a 
six-membered cyclic transition state. 38

an ice-salt bath. Add 33.4 g (20 ml, 0.35 mol) of methyl bromide (1) and seal 
the bottle with a rubber bung secured with wire. Remove the bottle from the 
cooling bath and leave for one day at room temperature. Cool the bottle in an 
ice-salt bath before opening, filter off the white crystalline solid under suction 
and wash with hot benzene (fume cupboard). Dry the product in the oven at 
100 °C and store in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. The yield is 
91.5 g (99%), m.p. 232-233 °C. 

Note. (1) Methyl bromide (b.p. 4.5 °C) is supplied in sealed vials. The vial must be 
thoroughly cooled in an ice-salt bath before any attempt is made to open it. It is 
advisable to wear a face mask and thick gloves during the operation. Wrap a cloth 
around the vial and score around the neck with a glass-knife. Place several layers of 
cloth around the scored neck and break off the end of the neck. 

Methylenecyclohexane. Fit a 250-ml three-necked flask containing a mag- 
netic stirring bar with a condenser, nitrogen inlet and a thermometer; 
surround the flask with a water bath supported on a hot-plate/magnetic 
stirrer unit. Pass a steady stream of dry nitrogen through the flask and main- 
tain the flow throughout the reaction. Place 125 ml of dry dimethyl sulphox- 
ide (Section 4.1J5, p. 412) in the flask and stir vigorously for 30 minutes to 
remove oxygen gas. Briefly remove the condenser from the flask and add 4.8 g 
(0.1 mol) of a 50 per cent suspension of sodium hydride in oil by means of a 
solids funnel. Warm the mixture to 65 °C on the water bath and stir until all 
the sodium hydride dissolves (about 1.5 hours). Cool the mixture to room 
temperature in a cold-water bath. Remove the condenser, place a solids 
funnel in the central neck of the flask and add 35.7 g (0.1 mol) of triphenyl- 
methylphosphonium bromide in portions over 15 minutes; the reaction is 
slightly exothermic. Replace the condenser and stir at room temperature for 
45 minutes to complete the formation of the methylenephosphorane. Add 
9.8 g (0.1 mol) of cyclohexanone in one portion; an exothermic reaction 
ensues and the temperature rises to about 70 °C. Stir the mixture at 50 °C for 
1 hour and then transfer to a single-neck 250-ml flask, add a boiling stick and 
attach a still-head and condenser arranged for vacuum distillation. A calcium 
chloride drying tube should be placed in the line between the water pump and 
receiving flask to prevent water vapour condensing in the flask. Distil and 
collect the volatile products boiling below 75 °C at 50mmHg in a receiver 
cooled in an acetone-Cardice bath; the distillate consists of methylenecyclo- 
hexane contaminated with a small amount of benzene. Redistil the crude 
product at atmospheric pressure through a 7-cm fractionating column 
packed with glass helices. Reject the material (mainly benzene) which boils 
below 99 °C, and collect the pure methylenecyclohexane as a fraction of b.p.

wise from a syringe (1) to a stirred solution of ethyldiphenylphosphine oxide 
(2.0 g, 8.69 mmol) (2) in dry tetrahydrofuran (30 ml) at 0°C (3). After 30 
minutes the red reaction solution is cooled to — 78 °C (acetone-solid carbon 
dioxide) and a solution of 3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde (1.3 g, 
8.69 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (10 ml) is added dropwise from a syringe. 
The rate of addition is such that the internal temperature is maintained at 
— 78 °C. The orange solution is allowed to warm to room temperature over 2 
hours and then water (25 ml) is added. The tetrahydrofuran is removed under 
reduced pressure and the aqueous residue is diluted with brine (15 ml) before 
extraction with dichloromethane (3 x 50 ml). The combined organic extracts 
are dried (magnesium sulphate) and evaporated to dryness to give the prod- 
uct as a crystalline mixture of diastereoisomers which are separated by flash 
column chromatography (elution with ethyl acetate) (4). The first diastereo-

PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The clear reaction solution is warmed to 50 °C for 30 minutes by which time a 
white solid precipitates from solution. The reaction mixture is cooled and the 
precipitate dissolved by the addition of water (25 ml). The mixture is diluted 
with brine (15 ml) and extracted with ether (3 x 40 ml). The combined 
organic extracts are washed with water (3 x 40 ml), dried (magnesium sul- 
phate), and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Bulb-to-bulb distil- 
lation (Kugelrohr apparatus) gives (Z)-isosafrole (108 mg, 84.4%) as a 
colourless liquid, R F 0.75 (fluorescent), i.r. (liquid film) 1500 (aryl-H), 1450, 
1260, and 1040 (C— O), 940 and 820cm" 1 ; p.m.r. (CDC1 3 , TMS) 5 6.8 (m,

J H Me= 2 and 7 Hz). Gas-liquid chromatography analysis (15% LAC-2R-446 
on Chromosorb W, 2.7 m x 3.1 mm) shows that the product contains c. 4 per 
cent of the (£)-isomer. 

Notes. (1) All reactions in non-aqueous solutions are carried out under a nitrogen 
atmosphere. 

(2) Preparation of alkyldiphenylphosphine oxides. General procedure from phospho- 
nium salts. Triphenyl phosphine is heated under reflux with an excess of alkyl halide. 
The precipitated phosphonium salt is filtered off, washed well with ether, and then 
heated with 30 per cent w/w aqueous sodium hydroxide (c. 4 ml/g) until all the ben- 
zene has distilled out. The mixture is cooled and extracted with dichloromethane, and 
the extracts are dried (magnesium sulphate) and evaporated to dryness. In this way 
ethyldiphenylphosphine oxide is obtained from triphenyl phosphine (65.6 g, 0.25 mol) 
and iodoethane (42.9 g, 0.275 mol) in dry toluene (250 ml) to give first the phospho- 
nium salt (102.4 g, 97.9%) after 3.5 hours, from which the phosphine oxide is obtained 
as needles (53.2 g, 92.5%), m.p. 123-124 °C (from ethyl acetate); p.m.r. &lt;5 (CDC1 3 , 
TMS) 7.9-7.3 (m, 10H, Ph 2 PO), 2.3 (m, 2H, CH 2 ) and 1.2 (dt, 3H, J HMc = 7 Hz, 
J MeP =17Hz, Me). 

(3) Dry tetrahydrofuran is freshly distilled from sodium wire using benzophenone rad- 
ical as an indicator. Toluene and ether are dried by distillation from sodium wire and 
are stored over sodium. Dimethylformamide is dried by distillation from 4A molecu- 
lar sieves and stored over 4A molecular sieves. 

(4) Thin-layer chromatograms are run on commercially prepared pre-coated plates 
(Merck, Kieselgel 6OF254) and eluted with ethyl acetate. Flash column chromato- 
graphy is carried out using a 150 x 51mm bed of Merck Kieselgel 60 (230-400 
mesh) silica. Optimum separation of diastereoisomeric phosphine oxides is achieved 
by eluting with solvent which gives the midpoint between the isomers as c. R F 0.45. 

(£)-Isosafrole. 3,4-Methylenedioxybenzoic acid. A solution of potassium per- 
manganate (18 g, 0.114mol) in water (360ml) is added over 45 minutes to a 
mixture of 3,4-methylenedioxybenzaldehyde (12 g, 0.08 mol) and water 
(300 ml) stirred at 80 °C. The reaction mixture is stirred a further 1 hour at 
80 °C, after which 10 per cent (w/w) aqueous potassium hydroxide (25 ml) is 
added and the mixture then filtered while hot. The filtrate is cooled to room 
temperature and the product precipitated by acidification (pH 2) with con- 
centrated hydrochloric acid. The precipitate is collected and washed with 
water to give the acid as needles (10 g, 75.4%), m.p. 229-231 °C (from 95% 
ethanol), R F 0.6, i.r. (Nujol mull) 2650-2500 (OH) and 1670 cm" 1 (C=0):

2-Diphenylphosphinoyl-l-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyI)propan-l-one. n-Butyl- 
lithium (1.5 m in hexane; 6.7 ml) is added dropwise from a syringe to a stirred 
solution of ethyldiphenylphosphine oxide (2.3 g, 0.01 mol) in dry tetrahydro- 
furan (35 ml) at 0°C [see Notes (1), (2) and (3) above]. After 30 minutes the 
red reaction solution is cooled to —78 °C (acetone-solid carbon dioxide) and 
a solution of methyl 3,4-methylenedioxybenzoate (900 mg, 5 mmol) in dry 
tetrahydrofuran (15 ml) is added dropwise from a syringe. The pale yellow 
solution is allowed to warm to room temperature before addition of water 
(20 ml) and removal of the tetrahydrofuran under reduced pressure. The 
aqueous residues are diluted with brine (15 ml) and extracted with dichloro- 
methane (3 x 30 ml). The combined organic extracts are dried (magnesium 
sulphate) and evaporated to dryness to give an oil that crystallises with time. 
Flash column chromatography (elution with ethyl acetate-acetone, 2:1) gives 
the ketone as needles (1.6g, 84.7% based on the ester), m.p. 163-165 °C (from

Reduction of the a-diphenylphosphinoyl ketone. Sodium borohydride (1 lOmg, 
2.91 mmol) is added in one portion to a stirred solution of the ketone (1.1 g, 
2.91 mmol) in ethanol (30 ml). The reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 
3 hours, cooled to room temperature, and then saturated aqueous ammo- 
nium chloride (15 ml) is added. The ethanol is removed under reduced pres- 
sure and several drops of dilute hydrochloric acid are added to the aqueous 
residues. After dilution with brine (20 ml), the aqueous reaction mixture is 
extracted with dichloromethane (3 x 50 ml) and the combined organic 
extracts are dried (magnesium sulphate) and evaporated to dryness to give 
the product as a mixture of diastereoisomers. Separation by flash column 
chromatography (elution with ethyl acetate-acetone, 4: 1) gives the (1RS,2SR)- 
phosphine oxide (erythro-isomer) (65 mg, 5.9%) and the (1RS,2RS)- 
phosphine oxide (f/ireo-isomer) (1.007 g, 90.7%).

methyltrimethylsilane (2.5 g, 0.02 mol) and magnesium (0.5 g, 0.02 mol) in 
sodium-dried ether (25 ml), is added a solution of 6-methylhept-5-en-2-one 
(2.5 g, 0.02 mol) (Aldrich) in sodium-dried ether (5 ml). The addition is drop- 
wise at such a rate that a gentle reflux of the mixture is maintained. The reac- 
tion mixture is refluxed with continued stirring. After 3 hours, the reaction 
mixture is cooled in an ice bath and thionyl chloride (1.8 ml, 0.025 mol) is 
added. The ice bath is removed and stirring continued at room temperature. 
After 1 hour, the reaction mixture is hydrolysed by the dropwise addition of a 
saturated solution of ammonium chloride. The coagulated solid is filtered off 
and washed with ether. Distillation of the combined filtrate-washings after 
drying gives 1.4g (57%) of 2,6-dimethylhepta-l,5-diene as a clear colourless

5.2.4 SELECTED REARRANGEMENTS OF ALKYNES TO ALLENES 

Unsaturated compounds containing two cumulated double bonds, i.e. 
&gt; C=C=C &lt;, are known as allenes. In addition to methods involving elimina- 
tion reactions and other reactions analogous to those used in the synthesis of 
alkenes, compounds of this type may be prepared by the rearrangement of suit- 
ably substituted alkynes. A particularly useful method of preparing simple 
allenic hydrocarbons involves the treatment of secondary or tertiary propargyl 
halides (e.g. (11)) with a zinc-copper couple in boiling ethanol. The mechanism 
of the reaction, which involves replacement of a halogen by hydrogen with pro- 
pargylic bond migration, is not fully understood but a cyclic mechanism involv- 
ing an organozinc intermediate (13) and the solvent has been postulated.

The process is illustrated by the conversion of 3-chloro-3-methylpent-l-yne 
into 3-methylpenta-l,2-diene (Expt 5.21). Isolation of the allene is facilitated by 

504 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.2 



the fact that it forms an azeotrope with ethanol, which may be removed by 
washing with water. The required tertiary chloride is obtained by shaking 3- 
methylpent-l-yn-3-ol (14) with cold concentrated hydrochloric acid. Some of 
the 1-chloroallene (16) is additionally formed via the resonance stabilised carbo- 
cation ion (15). However, 1-chloroallenes are reduced by a zinc-copper couple 
to the corresponding allenes and hence the crude unsaturated chloride may be 
used directly for the allene synthesis.

Many secondary and tertiary propargyl alcohols give 1-haloallenes in good 
yield when treated with concentrated aqueous halo-acid in the presence of the 
corresponding copper(i) halide. Thus tertiary propargyl alcohols (17) react with 
48 per cent w/w hydrobromic acid in the presence of a catalyst consisting of 
copper(i) bromide, copper powder and ammonium bromide over a temperature 
range of 0-35 °C to form the corresponding 1-bromoallene (18) in yields up to 80 
per cent. A mechanism involving the intermediacy of an acetylene-copper(i) re- 
complex from which the 1-bromoallene is formed by a stereospecific S N i' process 
in which the configuration is retained, has been proposed.

An example of this reaction is provided by the conversion of 2-methylbut-3- 
yn-2-ol to l-bromo-3-methylbuta-l,2-diene (Expt 5.22). 

Secondary propargyl alcohols (17; R 2 = H) require rather stronger acid and 
a longer reaction time, and the resulting bromoallenes may contain up to 5 per 
cent of the 3-bromoacetylenes, which may, however, be removed by fractional 
distillation.

3-Methylpenta-l,2-diene. Prepare a zinc-copper couple as follows. Place

tilled water, two 100 ml portions of 2 per cent aqueous copper(n) sulphate, 
two 50 ml portions of distilled water, 100 ml of 95 per cent ethanol and 100 ml 
of absolute ethanol. Each washing operation should last for about 1 minute 
and the liquid should then be drained as thoroughly as possible by decanta- 
tion before continuing with the next liquid wash. Finally transfer the zinc- 
copper couple by washing with 100 ml of absolute ethanol into a 250-ml 
three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, separa- 
tory funnel and an efficient {e.g. paddle-type) sealed stirrer. Heat the stirred 
zinc-ethanol suspension to boiling, remove the source of heat and then add 
the crude chloroacetylene (69.5 g) dropwise from the separatory funnel at 
such a rate so as to maintain gentle reflux; this should take about 50 minutes. 
Then heat the stirred reaction mixture under gentle reflux for 45 minutes, 
allow to cool slightly and rearrange the condenser for downward distillation. 
Distil the reaction mixture with stirring and collect the allene-ethanol azeo- 
trope which passes over between 64 and 78 °C. Wash the colourless distillate 
with three portions of water (1 x 150 ml; 2 x 50 ml) and then separate the 
upper organic layer and dry over magnesium sulphate. Distil the crude prod- 
uct through a fractionating column (15 cm x 2 cm) filled with glass helices. 
Reject any material distilling below 70 °C, which contains appreciable quanti- 
ties of acetylenic material, and collect 3-methylpenta-l,2-diene (&gt;95% pur- 
ity) as a colourless liquid, b.p. 70-72 °C; the yield is about 18.9g 
(approximately 31% overall yield from 3-methylpent-l-yn-3-ol). Record the 
infrared spectrum as a liquid film. The strong absorption bands at 1964 cm" ' 
and 840 cm ~ ' are characteristic of the asymmetric C=C=C stretching and 
=CH 2 out-of-plane wagging vibrations respectively of a terminal allene. The 
presence of a trace of acetylenic impurity may be observed as a weak absorp- 
tion at 3305cm" 1 (=C — H stretch). The purity of the 1,2-diene may be 
checked by g.l.c. on a 1.5-m column of 10 per cent Silicone oil on Chromosorb 
W held at 61 °C with a nitrogen flow rate of 40 ml/minute; the compound has 
t R 1.7 minutes.

In a 250-ml two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer and a 
dropping funnel, place a mixture of 14.3 g (0.1 mol) of powdered copper(i) 
bromide, 9.8 g (0.1 mol) of powdered ammonium bromide, 0.64 g (0.01 mol) of 
copper powder and 80 ml (c. 0.66 mol) of 46-48 per cent w/w concentrated 
hydrobromic acid (d 1.46-1.49). Stir the dark green mixture vigorously at 
room temperature and add 25.2 g (0.3 mol) of 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol drop- 
wise during 5 minutes; maintain the vigorous stirring for 1.5 hours (1). Filter 
the reaction mixture through a sintered glass Buchner funnel and rinse the 
reaction vessel and funnel with 10 ml of light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C). 
Transfer the filtrate to a separatory funnel, discard the lower aqueous layer 
and remove any unchanged alcohol and copper salts from the almost colour- 
less organic layer by shaking with three 10 ml portions of concentrated 
hydrobromic acid. In the final washing the lower acid layer should show no 
trace of violet coloration. Dry the combined organic layers over a mixture of 
solid sodium hydrogen carbonate and magnesium sulphate, filter through a 
sintered glass Buchner funnel; rinse the flask and the inorganic solids with 
5 ml of light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C). Transfer the filtrate to a 50-ml distilla- 
tion flask fitted with a 9-cm fractionating column filled with glass helices and 
distil under reduced pressure, using a nitrogen bleed, from a bath held at 80- 
90 °C. Collect the l-bromo-3-methylbuta-l,2-diene as a fraction, b.p. 52- 
54°C/50mmHg, in a flask cooled in ice-water (2). The yield is 28.1 g (64%). 
The purity of the product may be checked by g.l.c. analysis using a 1.5-m col- 
umn of 10 per cent Silicone oil on Chromosorb W held at 80 °C with a nitro- 
gen flow rate of 40 ml/minute; the material has t R 3.5 minutes. The infrared 
spectrum (liquid film) shows the characteristic strong allene (C=C=C) 
absorption band at 1950 cm" 1 (see Fig. 3.20). On standing l-bromo-3- 
methylbuta-l,2-diene tends to isomerise to l-bromo-3-methylbuta-l,3-diene 
and polymerise. 

Notes. (1) The progress of the reaction may be monitored by occasionally halting the 
stirring and removing a portion of the clear upper organic layer for infrared examina- 
tion. The reaction is complete when a sample does not show hydroxyl and alkynyl 
hydrogen absorption at 3400 and 3300 cm" 1 respectively. 

(2) In common with the distillation of all unsaturated compounds in general, the resi- 
due in the distillation flask should be cooled to room temperature before admitting air 
into the system.

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The sharp characteristic i.r. absorption band in the region of 2200 cm" ', arising 
from the stretching of the carbon-carbon triple bond, is of variable intensity 
(p. 283), but the absorption is less intense than in the case of the nitrile group. 
Terminal alkynes are easily recognised from the strong sharp absorption band 
in the region of 3320 cm -2 arising from the stretching vibration of the carbon- 
hydrogen bond (the spectrum of phenylacetylene, Fig. 3.19). The alkynyl pro- 
tons and the a-protons of alkyl groups attached to the alkynyl carbons are rela- 
tively more shielded due to magnetic anisotropic effects, and therefore resonate 
in the p.m.r. spectra at a higher field than the corresponding protons in substi- 
tuted alkenes. The m.s. of alkynes show a fragmentation behaviour which bears 
a close resemblance to that of alkenes (p. 374). Conjugated poly-ynes and enynes 
show absorption in the u.v.-visible spectra, and the position of the absorption 
maxima may provide a valuable guide to the extent of conjugation (p. 388).

5.31 THE DEHYDROHALOGENATION OF VIC- and fff^OIHALIOES 

A simple method for introducing a triple bond into an organic compound is to 
treat an appropriate dihalide with a strong base. Since vicinal dihalides (usually 
the bromide) are readily formed by reaction of bromine with an alkene, and 
geminal dihalides from aldehydes or ketones with phosphorus pentachloride, 
the method is a useful general procedure for the preparation of terminal and 
non-terminal alkynes from readily available starting materials. 

R 1 -CH=CH-R 2 &gt; R^CHBr-CHBr-R 2 &gt; R'-feC-R 2 

R'-COCHj-R 2 * R^CCVCHj-R 2 &gt; R^C^C-R 2 

The products from this reaction are not invariably homogeneous since the first 
formed alkyne may isomerise, probably by way of an intermediate allene. With 
alcoholic potassium hydroxide at 170-180 °C, for example, terminal alkynes 
tend to rearrange to internal alkynes. The rearrangement process may be 
minimised by using sodamide in liquid ammonia as the reagent. 

R-CH 2 -C=CH ^=± R-CH=C=CH 2 ^==± R-C=C-CH 3 

Examples of the use of alcoholic potassium hydroxide are given in Expt 5.23 
for the conversion of 10,11-dibromoundecanoic acid (itself prepared from 
undec-10-enoic acid and bromine), into undec-10-ynoic acid, and of ethyl cinna- 
mate into phenylpropynoic acid.

Recently PTC methods for the dehydrohalogenation process have been de- 
veloped. One uses tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate with 50 per cent 
sodium hydroxide and pentane-dichloromethane as the organic solvent 39 ; a 
second uses 18-crown-6 with solid potassium t-butoxide and light petroleum as 
solvent. 40 A third procedure uses tetraoctylammonium bromide as the phase 
transfer catalyst with solid potassium hydroxide in a light petroleum medium. 41 
In general, with these procedures, 1,2-dihalides, and 1,1 -dihalides from alde- 
hydes, give alk-1-ynes; internal geminal dihalides from symmetrical ketones give 
internal alkynes; 2,2 -dihalides from methyl ketones give alk-1-ynes only if C-3 is 
a tertiary carbon. 

The loss of a bromide ion when situated in a /^-position to a carboxylate 
group occurs very readily under mildly basic conditions. Thus in an alternative 
synthesis of phenylacetylene (Expt 5.24), cinnamic acid dibromide is converted 
into /?-bromostyrene under the influence of hot aqueous sodium carbonate solu- 
tion. Dehydrobromination to yield the acetylenic compound is then achieved in 
the usual manner with potassium hydroxide.

Purify commercial undecylenic acid by distillation of, say, 250 g under dimin- 
ished pressure and collect the fraction, b.p. 152-1 54 °C/6mmHg; this has a 
freezing point of 23 °C. Dissolve 108 g (0.58 mol) of the purified undecylenic 
acid in 285 ml of dry carbon tetrachloride (CAUTION, p. 399) in a 1 -litre 
three-necked flask provided with a sealed stirrer unit, a dropping funnel and a 
reflux condenser. Cool the flask in a freezing mixture of ice and salt, stir the 
solution and add 96 g (31 ml, 0.6 mol) of dry bromine (Section 4.2.9, p. 422) 
during a period of 1 hour: allow the mixture to warm up gradually to the tem- 
perature of the laboratory. Remove the carbon tetrachloride with a rotary 
evaporator and pour the residue into a large evaporating dish (fume cup- 
board). Upon standing 1-2 days (more rapidly when left in a vacuum desic- 
cator over silica gel), the dibromo acid crystallises completely. The yield is 
quantitative. 

Transfer the solid dibromo acid to a 2-litre round-bottomed flask attached 
to a reflux condenser, add a solution of 263 g of potassium hydroxide in 
158 ml of water, and heat in an oil bath at 150-1 60 °C for 8 hours. Consider- 
able frothing occurs, but this is reduced by the addition of small quantities 
(about 0.1 g) of a suitable detergent, e.g. sodium dodecyl benzenesulphonate, 
from time to time. Allow the mixture to stand overnight, add 1500 ml of 
water, shake until all the solid dissolves and acidify with dilute sulphuric acid 
to Congo red. A solid cake of acid separates on the surface of the liquid after 
standing for several hours. Extract with four 250 ml portions of ether, dry 
with anhydrous sodium or magnesium sulphate and remove the ether by dis- 
tillation on a water bath. Transfer the residue to a 250-ml flask fitted with a 
Claisen still-head and distil cautiously under diminished pressure using a free 
flame. A little ether and water pass over first and the temperature rises rapidly 
to 175°C/15mmHg. Collect separately the fractions (a) b.p. 177-182 °C/ 
15mmHg (52 g) and (b) 1 82-200 °C/1 5 mmHg (15 g). The flask contains a 
large residue, which is discarded. Fraction (a) solidifies completely on cooling 
and has m.p. 37-41 °C; upon recrystallisation from light petroleum, b.p. 60- 
80 °C, 34g (32%) of pure undec-10-ynoic acid, m.p. 41-42 °C, are obtained. A 
further quantity of product is obtained from fraction (b), which solidifies to a 
slightly sticky solid: upon recrystallisation from light petroleum, b.p. 60- 
80 °C, a sticky solid separates, which, after spreading upon a porous tile, 
becomes colourless and has m.p. 41-52 °C (3g). 

Cognate preparations. Phenylpropynoic acid. Place a solution of 88 g (84 ml, 
0.5 mol) of ethyl cinnamate (Expt 6.137) in 50 ml of carbon tetrachloride in a 
500-ml round-bottomed flask. Immerse the flask in ice and add 80 g (25.5 ml, 
0.5 mol) of bromine from a separatory funnel slowly with frequent shaking. 
The halogen will disappear rapidly at first, but more slowly towards the end 
of the reaction; no hydrogen bromide is evolved and the time of the addition 
is about 20-25 minutes. Allow the mixture to stand for 1 hour, pour the solu- 
tion into a large evaporating dish and permit the excess of bromine and the 
carbon tetrachloride to evaporate spontaneously in the fume cupboard. The 
crude ethyl 2,3-dibromo-3-phenylpropanoate will remain as a solid cake; this 

510 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.3 



can be dried by pressing between large filter papers. The yield of crude ester, 
m.p. 66-71 °C, is 140 g (83%) (1). 

Dissolve 85 g of potassium hydroxide in 400 ml of rectified spirit by heat- 
ing in a 1500-ml round-bottomed flask, provided with a reflux condenser, on 
a water bath. Cool to 40-50 °C, and add 112g (0.33 mol) of the crude 
dibromo ester; when the initial exothermic reaction has subsided, heat the 
mixture on a water bath for 5-6 hours. Pour the contents of the flask into a 
large beaker and, when cold, add concentrated hydrochloric acid with stir- 
ring until neutral to litmus. Cool, filter the precipitated solids at the pump 
and wash with a little alcohol. Set the solids (A) aside. Transfer the filtrate to 
the original flask and distil the liquid until the temperature of the vapour 
reaches 95 °C. Combine the residue in the flask with the precipitated solids 
(A), dissolve in 270 ml of water, add about 300 g of crushed ice and cool the 
flask in an ice bath. Stir the mixture mechanically, and add 20 per cent sul- 
phuric acid slowly until the solution is strongly acid to Congo red. Allow to 
stand for 20 minutes, filter off the dark-coloured crude phenylpropynoic acid 
at the pump and wash it with three 1 5 ml portions of 2 per cent sulphuric acid. 
Dissolve the solid in about 300 ml of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution, 
add 6 g of decolourising charcoal and heat on a water bath for 30 minutes 
with occasional shaking. Filter through a fluted filter paper, cool the filtrate 
in ice and then add 70 g of crushed ice. Stir the solution mechanically and add 
20 per cent sulphuric acid slowly until acid to Congo red. After 20 minutes, 
filter the precipitated acid by suction, wash with 15 ml of 2 per cent sulphuric 
acid, then with a little water, and dry in the air. The yield of pure phenylpro- 
pynoic acid, m.p. 134-135 °C, is 23 g (47%). 

Note. (1) To obtain the pure dibromo ester, recrystallise from light petroleum, b.p. 
60-80 °C; the recovery of the pure ester, m.p. 75 °C, is 85 per cent.

Dissolve 74 g (0.5 mol) of cinnamic acid in 300 ml of hot dichloromethane in a 
500-ml flask and cool the solution in ice-water with shaking. As soon as the 
solid begins to crystallise out, add a solution of 80 g (26 ml, 0.5 mol) of bro- 
mine (care in handling) in 50 ml of dichloromethane rapidly in three portions 
with vigorous shaking and cooling. Allow the flask and contents to stand in 
an ice-bath for 30 minutes to allow complete crystallisation of the product; 
collect the latter by filtration. Obtain a pure specimen of 2,3-dibromo-3- 
phenylpropanoic acid (m.p. 204 °C decomp.) by recrystallising a small sample 
of the crude product from aqueous ethanol. Boil the bulk of the crude bromo- 
acid under reflux with 750 ml of 10 per cent aqueous sodium carbonate solu- 
tion, cool and separate the layer of crude /?-bromostyrene. Extract the 
aqueous phase with two 75 ml portions of ether, combine this extract with the 
organic phase, dry over anhydrous calcium chloride and remove the ether on 
a rotary evaporator. About 65-70 g of crude /?-bromostyrene is obtained. 

Place lOOg of potassium hydroxide pellets in a 500-ml flask, moisten the 
pellets with about 2 ml of water and fit the flask with a still-head carrying a 
dropping funnel and a condenser set for downward distillation. Heat the flask 

511 



5.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



in an oil bath maintained at 200 °C and add the crude /?-bromostyrene drop- 
wise on to the molten alkali at a rate of about 1 drop per second. Phenyl- 
acetylene begins to distil over; slowly raise the bath temperature to about 
220 °C and keep it at this point until the addition is complete. Then continue 
to heat at about 230 °C until no more product distils over. Separate the upper 
layer of the distillate, dry it over potassium hydroxide pellets and redistil. 
Collect the phenylacetylene at 142-144 °C: the yield is 25 g (49%). The p.mx 
spectrum (CDC1 4 , TMS) exhibits signals at (5 3.08 (s, 1H) and 7.35 (m, 5H). 



5.3.2 THE OXIDATION OF DIHYDRAZONES OF 1.2-DIKETONES 

This method has been of particular value for the synthesis of cyclic acetylenes, 
the diketones having been prepared from the corresponding acyloins (Section 
5.9.1, p. 628). 



(CH 2 ) n 




An early procedure used triethyl phosphate directly on the diketone, but 
better yields are obtained by the oxidation of the corresponding dihydrazone. 42 
The oxidant may be mercury(ii) oxide, which is rather expensive; 43 alternatively 
copper(i) chloride in dichloromethane and pyridine is oxidised with oxygen gas, 
and the derived complex is then used to oxidise the dihydrazone to the acetyl- 
enic group with the evolution of nitrogen. 44 The reaction is illustrated by the 
conversion of benzil dihydrazone into diphenylacetylene (Expt 5.25).

CAUTION: Great care should be taken in the handling of hydrazine hydrate 
since it is highly corrosive and a suspected carcinogen; protective gloves and a

Benzil dihydrazone. A solution of 105.1 g (0.5 mol) of benzil in 325 ml of 
propan-1-ol is prepared in a round-bottomed flask which is fitted with a 
reflux condenser. To this solution 76 g (1.30 mol) of 85 per cent hydrazine 
hydrate is added and the mixture heated under reflux for 60 hours. The solu- 
tion is cooled in an ice bath and the benzil dihydrazone is separated by suc- 
tion filtration. The crystals are washed with 200 ml of cold absolute ethanol 



512 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.3 



and dried on the suction filter for 1 hour. The yield of benzil dihydrazone is 
99-106g (83-89%), m.p. 150-151.5 °C. 

Dipheny lacety lene. Reagent grade copper(i) chloride (0.403 g, 4.0 mmol) is 
dissolved in a mixture of dry dichloromethane (20 ml) and pyridine (2 ml, 
CAUTION) to give a yellow-green clear solution. Oxygen gas from a gas 
burette is introduced to the solution with vigorous stirring. Rapid absorption 
of oxygen (about 20 ml) ceases in 1 5 minutes, the mixture becoming a dark 
green suspension. To the mixture is added dropwise a solution of benzil 
dihydrazone (0.237g, l.Ommol) in dichloromethane (10ml) over a period of 
10 minutes at room temperature with stirring. The slightly exothermic reac- 
tion proceeds smoothly with nitrogen evolution. Stirring is continued for 1 
hour under an oxygen atmosphere to ensure the completion of the oxidation. 
The mixture is hydrolysed with 3 m hydrochloric acid (40 ml), the organic 
layer is separated, and the aqueous layer extracted twice with dichloro- 
methane. The combined organic layer and extracts are washed with brine, 
dried over magnesium sulphate, and evaporated to leave the crude diphenyl- 
acetylene, which is purified by column chromatography (silica gel, hexane), to 
give 0.173 g (97%) of pure diphenylacetylene, m.p. 59-60 °C. 

5.3.3 ALKYLATION OF A TERMINAL ALKYNE 

Terminal alkynes by virtue of the presence of an acidic hydrogen atom can be 
converted into the corresponding alkynylsodium or alkynylmagnesium halide 
(see Section 5.4.2, p. 531) which may then be alkylated to give a homologous 
alkyne. 

R'-C=CH + NaNH 2 *■ R'-C=C e Na® -^&gt; R'-C=C-R 2 

Acetylene itself can form both the mono- or di-sodium salt; the former is the 
main product when a large excess of acetylene is used in the reaction with soda- 
mide in liquid ammonia. 

In these alkylation reactions primary alkyl halides (the bromide for prefer- 
ence) should be used as the alkylating agents, since secondary and tertiary 
halides undergo extensive olefin-forming elimination reactions in the presence of 
the strongly basic acetylide ion. A typical synthesis is that of hex-1-yne (Expt 
5.26). 

A modified procedure which is suitable for the introduction of a secondary or 
tertiary alkyl group uses the trialkynylalane as the intermediate. This is formed 
from aluminium chloride and an alkynyllithium, and then subsequently allowed 
to react with the tertiary or secondary halide. 45

5.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Equip a 5-litre three-necked flask (or a 5-litre flange flask fitted with a mul- 
tiple head adapter) with a Herschberg or other efficient stirrer, a soda-lime 
guard-tube and a liquid ammonia inlet tube as described in Section 2.17.7, 
(p. 116). Observing the precautions noted in this section, run in liquid ammo- 
nia until the flask is about two-thirds full (c. 3.5 litres). Prepare a suspension 
of sodamide from 138 g (6 mol) of clean sodium (Section 4.2.65, p. 462) using 
0.5 g of finely-powdered crystallised iron(m) nitrate as the catalyst as de- 
scribed in detail in Section 4.2.67 (p. 462). It may be necessary to add further 
quantities of liquid ammonia to maintain the volume of 3.5 litres. When the 
conversion of sodium into sodamide is complete, replace the ammonia- 
addition tube by a wide tube reaching almost to the bottom of the flask to 
allow for the passage of acetylene through the suspension of sodamide. The 
acetylene gas from a cylinder should be freed from acetone by passing 
through two Drechsel bottles half-filled with concentrated sulphuric acid; 
when the acid in the second wash bottle becomes discoloured the wash 
bottles should be recharged with fresh acid. An empty Drechsel bottle (to act 
as a safety trap) and a mercury escape valve (cf. Fig. 2.60) should be inter- 
posed between the reaction flask and the Drechsel bottles charged with sul- 
phuric acid. Surround the reaction flask with an acetone-Cardice cooling 
bath and pass acetylene rapidly (2-3 litres per minute) into the sodamide sus- 
pension until a uniformly black liquid is formed (usually 4-5 hours) (1). Care- 
fully watch the mercury escape valve in case the wide entry tube becomes 
blocked by deposition of solid. If this should happen, temporarily stop the 
acetylene flow and clear the tube by inserting a glass rod of appropriate dia- 
meter. It may also become necessary to introduce some more liquid ammo- 
nia. Replace the soda-lime guard-tube with a pressure-equalising separatory 
funnel charged with 685 g (538 ml, 5 mol) of butyl bromide which is intro- 
duced over a period of 1.5-2 hours with stirring and while a slow stream of 
acetylene (c. 500 ml per minute) continues to pass through the reaction mix- 
ture. The reaction is exothermic so that it will be necessary to maintain the 
cooling bath at — 50 °C by continued addition of solid carbon dioxide. When 
all the alkyl bromide has been added, discontinue the supply of acetylene and 
allow the ammonia to evaporate. Before evaporation is complete add cau- 
tiously 60 g of ammonium chloride with stirring to decompose the excess of 
sodium acetylide (or sodamide) if present. Now introduce 500 g of crushed ice 
followed by about 1.5 litres of distilled water. Steam distil the reaction mix- 
ture, separate the hydrocarbon layer in the distillate, dry over magnesium sul- 
phate and fractionally distil through a Hempel column filled with Fenske 
rings. Collect the hex-1-yne, b.p. 71-72 °C. The yield is 280g (68%). The i.r. 
absorptions occur at 3300 (=CH) and 2120cm" 1 (C=C). The 13 C-n.m.r. 
(CDC1 3 , TMS) has absorptions at 3 13.7 (C 6 ), 18.3 (C 5 ), 22.1 (C 4 ), 30.9 (C 3 ),

Note. (1) Occasionally the reaction mixture does not become completely black nor 
free from suspended solid; here the acetylide is an insoluble (or sparingly soluble) 
form, but it gives satisfactory results in the preparation of hex-1-yne. The saturated 
solution of the soluble forms of sodium acetylide in liquid ammonia at — 34 °C is

5.34 COUPLING REACTIONS LEADING TO DIYNES 

Oxidative coupling of a terminal alkyne is a particularly easily performed 
carbon-carbon &lt;r-bond forming reaction, which results in a good yield of the 
symmetrical diacetylene. A widely used procedure involves the oxidation of the 
alkyne with air or oxygen in aqueous ammonium chloride in the presence of a 
copper(i) chloride catalyst (Glaser oxidative coupling).

A modified procedure illustrated by the synthesis of a diynediol (Expt 5.27) from 
the acetylenic alcohol, 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol, uses methanol and pyridine as the 
solvent, the latter acting also as a complexing agent for the copper(i) ions. An 
alternative effective coupling system involves the use of copper(n) acetate in pyr- 
idine which does not require the use of air or oxygen. 

A coupling procedure particularly suited to the synthesis of unsymmetrical 
diacetylenes involves the reaction of a terminal acetylene with a 1-bromo- 
acetylene in the presence of a catalyst consisting of a solution of copper(i) chlor- 
ide in a primary amine to which small quantities of hydroxylamine 
hydrochloride is added (the Cadiot-Chodkiewicz coupling).

R'-C=CCu + BrC=C-R 2 ► R'-C=C-C=C-R- + Cu® + Br® 

The organic base serves to remove the liberated protons and to assist solution of 
the copper(i) catalyst by the formation of a complex. Hydroxylamine 
hydrochloride helps to maintain an adequate concentration of copper(i) ions, 
which however is best kept rather low otherwise unwanted self-coupling of the 
bromoalkyne occurs. The reaction is illustrated in Expt 5.28 by the coupling of 
co-bromophenylacetylene with 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-ol. 

The coupling of terminal acetylenic compounds with the reactive allylic bro- 
mides in the presence of l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) and 
copper(i) iodide appears to be a useful route to the non-conjugated enyne 
system, e.g. the formation of hex-5-en-2-yn-l-ol. 46

water bath. Then, whilst stirring magnetically, and with continued cooling, 
add from a dropping pipette 20.4 g (0. 1 1 3 mol) of co-bromophenylacetylene 
and ensure complete transfer of the bromo compound by rinsing several 
times the pipette and container with reaction mixture. When the addition has 
been completed, continue stirring and cooling for a further 10 minutes and 
then add 25 ml of 5 per cent aqueous potassium cyanide to complex the 
copper salts. Extract the solution with four 40 ml portions of ether and dry 
the combined extracts with anhydrous sodium sulphate. Filter and evaporate 
the ether solution using a rotary evaporator. Purify the solid product by 
recrystallisation from light petroleum (b.p. 80-100 °C), and wash the filtered 
product with light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C). The yield of pure diynol (4), 
m.p. 55-58 °C, is 15.3 g (73%). 

Notes. (1) Phenylacetylene has a penetrating and persistent odour and is mildly lachry- 
matory. It is recommended that it be handled in the fume cupboard and that protective 
gloves be worn. 

(2) w-Bromophenylacetylene has a very penetrating and persistent odour and is mildly

much shorter retention times [see Note (3) above]. 



5.4 ALIPHATIC ALCOHOLS 

The hydroxyl group in saturated alcohols may be located on a primary carbon 
atom (R-CH 2 OH), a secondary carbon atom (R 2 CHOH) or a tertiary carbon 
atom (R 3 COH). The hydroxyl-carrying carbon (the a-carbon) in secondary and 
in tertiary alcohols may be a chiral site (*), as shown below for: 
(S)-hexan-2-ol (1) CH 3 -CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 -CH(OH)-CH 3 ; 
and (S)-2,3-dimethylpentan-3-ol (2) CH3-CH(CH 3 )-C(CH 3 )(OH)-CH 2 -CH3.

Vinylic alcohols [R-CH=CH(OH) or R-CH=C(OH)-R] are transient 
tautomeric isomers of the corresponding aldehydes (R-CH 2 -CHO) or ketones 
(R-CH 2 -COR) respectively. Allylic alcohols (e.g. R-CH=CH-CH 2 OH) and 
homoallylic alcohols (e.g. R &gt; CH=CH-CH 2 -CH 2 OH) are important species and 
are considered in Section 5.18.1, p. 794. 

The stereoisomerism of vicinal diols of the type R 1 -CH(OH) , CH(OH)-R 2 is 
often denoted by the erythro/threo notation [e.g. formulae of pentane-2,3-diol, 
(3) and (4) below], which originates from the configuration of erythrose and 
threose (p. 639). This notation is applied in other instances (see p. 497).

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

An alcohol, either neat or in relatively concentrated solution, shows characteris- 
tic strong broad absorption in the 3400-3200 cm ~ ! region of the i.r. spectrum, 
due to the stretching of the intermolecular hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl group. In 
very dilute solution the non-hydrogen-bonded hydroxyl group shows sharp 
absorption in the region of 3600cm" 1 [e.g. heptan-1-ol, Fig. 3.23(a)-(c)]. The 
hydroxyl-hydrogen is readily recognised in the p.m.r. spectrum since it under- 
goes exchange with deuterium oxide under suitable conditions (e.g. ethanol, 
p. 348); the signals corresponding to the alkyl group (or groups) may sometimes 
be used for structural characterisation (see p. 341 for spin-spin splitting pat- 
terns). The l3 C-n.m.r. spectra of ethanol and butane- 1,4-diol are shown in Fig. 
3.50 and Fig. 3.74 respectively. The molecular ion is not usually observed in the 
m.s. and the highest fragment ion has a m/z value corresponding to (M — H 2 0) 
[e.g. propan-1-ol (Fig. 3.81)]. Alcohols do not absorb in the accessible region of 
the u.v.-visible spectrum. Illustrative examples of spectroscopic interpretation 
are provided in the preparative examples below. 

5.4.1 THE REDUCTION OF ALDEHYDES. KETONES AND ESTERS 

Primary and secondary alcohols may be synthesised by the reduction of the cor- 
responding carbonyl compounds by a great variety of reagents. 

R-CHO -^-&gt; R-CH 2 OH R'-CO-R : -^-&gt; R'-CH(OH)-R : 

Two reductive systems for ketones, which have the merit of being economic for 
large-scale preparations, are sodium and absolute ethanol (Expt 5.29), and zinc 
dust and aqueous sodium hydroxide (Expt 5.30). 

These dissolving metal reductions have the disadvantage of being relatively 
unselective. Potassium borohydride and sodium borohydride however each 
show a considerable degree of selectivity; thus aldehydes and ketones may be 
reduced to alcohols while halogeno, cyano, nitro, amido and alkoxycarbonyl 
groups remain unaffected. The reductions of chloral and m-nitrobenzaldehyde 
(Expt 5.31) to the corresponding substituted alcohols are illustrative of this 
selectivity. The reagents are used in aqueous ethanolic solution. The essential 
step in the mechanism of these reactions involves a hydride ion transfer to the 
carbonyl carbon from the borohydride anion, which is capable of reducing 
4 moles of carbonyl compound. Decomposition of the resulting anionic complex 
with water or dilute acid liberates the required alcohol.

Aldehydes and ketones can be selectively reduced to the corresponding alco- 
hols by aluminium alkoxides. The most satisfactory alkoxide for general use is 
aluminium isopropoxide. 

SR'-CO-R 2 + [Me 2 CHO] 3 Al t " [R 1 R 2 CHO] 3 Al + 3Me 2 CO 

The carbonyl compound to be reduced is heated with aluminium isopropoxide 
in excess isopropyl alcohol (propan-2-ol) under a simple fractionating column 
with provision for slow distillation until no more acetone is detected in the distil- 
late; the alcoholic reduction product is recovered from the reaction mixture after 
acidification. The process is usually termed the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley 
reduction. It is a mild method of reducing carbonyl compounds in good yield, 
and is particularly valuable since other groups, e.g. a conjugated double bond, a 
nitro group or a halogen atom, are unaffected. Experimental details for the 
reduction of crotonaldehyde (Expt 5.32) are given. The above reversible equa- 
tion indicates that 1 mol of aluminium isopropoxide will reduce directly 3 moles 
of the carbonyl compound. It is generally desirable to use excess of the reductant 
except for aromatic aldehydes; for the latter, side reactions (e.g. 2R-CHO -» 
R-CCvR; Tishchenko reaction) tend to occur with excess of the reagent. 

The mechanism of the reaction involves the coordination of the carbonyl 
compound with the aluminium atom in aluminium isopropoxide followed by an 
intramolecular transfer of a hydride ion:

The product is the racemic [(K)/(S)] alcohol since the free energies of the two 
diastereoisomeric transition states, resulting from hydride attack on the si-face 
of the ketone as shown (order of priorities O &gt; R 1 &gt; R 2 , p. 16) or the re-face, are 
identical. The use of an aluminium alkoxide, derived from an optically pure 
secondary alcohol, to effect a stereoselective reaction (albeit in low ee%) was one 
of the first instances of an asymmetric reduction. 48 Here (S)-( + )-butan-2-ol, in 
the form of the aluminium alkoxide, with 6-methylheptan-2-one was shown to 
give rise to two diastereoisomeric transition states [(5), (R,S); and (6), (S,S)] 
which lead to an excess of (S)-6-methylheptan-2-ol [derived from transition 
state (6)], as expected from a consideration of the relative steric interactions. 
Transition state (5) has a less favourable Me — Me and Et — Hex interaction and 
hence a higher free energy of activation; it therefore represents the less favour- 
able reaction pathway (see p. 15).

More recently a very great variety of chiral complexed aluminium hydride 
reagents, derived from lithium aluminium hydride, have been studied in an en- 
deavour to increase the differences in steric interactions which could develop in 
diastereoisomeric transition states. 49 One of the most recent is the lithium alu- 
minium hydride complex from either (R)-( + )- or (S)-( — )-l,l'-bi-2-naphthol 
(Section 6.1.3, p. 836). 50 This chiral inducing agent is expensive but has been 
successfully used for chiral reductions in the syntheses of various pheromones, 
prostaglandins and related biologically important compounds, 5 ! since high ee 
per cent values (often greater than 80%) are obtained. 

A useful illustrative example of stereoselective reduction, which has the merit 
of being economic, and which reduces a range of dialkyl, alkyl alkynyl, or alkyl 
aryl ketones in good chemical and optical yield is given in Expt 5.33. 52 For the 
asymmetric reduction of acetophenone, lithium aluminium hydride is allowed to 
react with 3-0-benzyl-l,2-0-cyclohexylidene-a-D-glucofuranose (Expt 5.115) to 
give the complex (7). The most favourable transition state for the reduction of 
the ketone with (7) is that in which a hydride ion (from the less screened H") is 
transferred to the re-face of acetophenone to give (S)-(— )-l-phenylethanol (ee 
33%). If however the complex (7) is first allowed to react with ethanol to form 
the trialkoxy-complex (8), reduction of acetophenone results from the transfer of 
a hydride ion from the more screened H' to the si-face of acetophenone to give 
(R)-( + )-l-phenylethanol (ee 53%). 




(7) (8) 

Stereoselective reductions based on complexed borohydrides have also 
proved of value in many instances; in particular they have been of use in the syn- 
thesis of epimeric cyclic alcohols. For example, the reduction of 4-t-butylcyclo- 
hexanone to the ds-alcohol [99.5%, arising from equatorial hydride ion attack 
(i)] is effected by L-Selectride (lithium tri-s-butylborohydride, cf. Section 4.2.49, 
p. 448), or LS-Selectride 53 (lithium trisiamylborohydride, cf. Section 4.2.49, 
p. 448) but to the frans-alcohol [98%, arising from axial hydride ion attack (ii)] 
with lithium butyl borohydride. 54 The experimental details of these reductions 
are given in Expt 5.34.

been effected with Ti(m) species and the method has been adapted to effect intra- 
molecular coupling reactions. 55 Retrosynthetically this bimolecular reduction 
may be regarded as a reconnection process and is particularly useful with aro- 
matic ketones, when the reaction may be carried out photolytically, as in the 
case of the conversion of benzophenone into benzopinacol in the presence of

Esters may alternatively be reduced to primary alcohols either using hydro- 
gen under pressure in the presence of a copper chromite catalyst, 56 or with lith- 
ium aluminium hydride (Expt 5.38), but not with sodium borohydride which is 
insufficiently reactive. However it has been found recently that sodium boro-

1,3-diols, and this method offers a convenient route to this type of compound. 57

Note. (1) The ketone may be synthesised as in Expt 5.95; it is also available commer-

tained at 20-30 °C - the reaction is strongly exothermic. When the boro- 
hydride solution has been added, allow the reaction mixture to stand at room 
temperature for 10 minutes; stir occasionally. Then add 2 ml of 2.5 m hydro- 
chloric acid dropwise and with stirring to destroy any residual borohydride 
and finally add a further 5 ml of the acid. Add sufficient ether to form two dis- 
tinct layers, separate the ether layer, wash it with a little water and dry over 
magnesium sulphate. Remove the ether on a rotary evaporator and distil the 
residue from an air bath. Collect the 2,2,2-trichloroethanol at 151-153 °C. 
The yield is 9.8 g (65%). 

Cognate preparation. m-Nitrobenzyl alcohol. Clamp a 500-ml three-necked 
flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and a burette, above 
the bench so that an ice bath can be placed beneath it. Place a solution of 
15.1 g (0.1 mol) of m-nitrobenzaldehyde (Expt 6.19) in 100 ml of methanol in 
the flask and, while stirring, add a solution of sodium borohydride (1.4g, 
0.037 mol NaBH 4 in 2 ml of 2 m sodium hydroxide diluted with 18 ml of 
water) at the rate of 0.5 ml per minute, with occasional cooling to keep the 
reaction at 18-25 °C. When about three-quarters of the solution has been 
added, there is no further tendency for the temperature to rise, and the addi- 
tion is stopped. Treat a small portion of the reaction mixture with dilute sul- 
phuric acid: hydrogen should be evolved. 

Remove most of the methanol by distillation on a steam bath, and dilute 
the residue with 100 ml of water. Extract the mixture with ether, wash the 
upper layer with water and dry it rapidly with a little anhydrous magnesium 
sulphate. Remove the ether by flash distillation and distil the residual pale 
yellow oil under diminished pressure. Collect the m-nitrobenzyl alcohol at 
183-185 °C/1 7 mmHg; it solidifies to a pale yellow solid, m.p. 30 °C, when 
cooled in ice. The yield is 13 g (85%).

Prepare a solution of aluminium isopropoxide (see Section 4.2.2, p. 415) from 
23.5 g (0.83 mol) of aluminium, 0.5 g of mercury(n) chloride and 250 ml of dry 
isopropyl alcohol (Section 4.1.77, p. 402); add 105 g (1.5 mol) of redistilled 
crotonaldehyde, b.p. 102-103 °C, and 500 ml of dry isopropyl alcohol. Attach 
an efficient fractionating column to the flask and arrange for distillation from 
an oil bath so that the acetone distils as it is formed. Maintain the temperat- 
ure of the bath at about 110°C and the temperature at the top of the column 
at 60-70 °C. When the distillate no longer gives a test for acetone (8-9 hours) 
(1), reflux for a further 10 minutes and then distil off most of the remaining 
isopropyl alcohol, preferably under reduced pressure. Cool the residue to 
40 °C and add 450 ml of cold 3 m sulphuric acid (from 72.5 ml of concentrated 
sulphuric acid and 395 ml of water); cooling is necessary. Separate the upper 
oily layer, wash it once with water and distil at 60-70 °C while lowering the

to 110°C and 20 mm. In this way the crotyl alcohol (A) is separated from the 
higher boiling polymerisation products. Combine the aqueous layers and dis- 
til until the distillate no longer gives a test for unsaturation with a dilute solu- 
tion of bromine in carbon tetrachloride. Saturate the aqueous distillate with 
potassium carbonate, separate the oily layer and add it to (A). Dry with 5 g of 
anhydrous potassium carbonate, decant the oil and distil through an efficient 
fractionating column. Collect the crotyl alcohol at 119-121 °C. The yield is

Method A. cis-4-t-Butylcyclohexanol. 53 An oven-dried 250-ml two-necked 
flask, equipped with a Teflon stopcock, a magnetic stirrer bar, and a reflux 
condenser connected to a mercury bubbler, is cooled to room temperature 
under a dry stream of nitrogen. Lithium trisiamylborohydride solution in 
tetrahydrofuran (LS-Selectride, 67 ml, 28 mmol) is introduced into the reac- 
tion flask and cooled to — 78 °C (dry ice-acetone). Then 3.7 g {24 mmol) of 4- 
t-butylcyclohexanone dissolved in 25 ml of tetrahydrofuran (maintained at 
0°C) is added. The resulting mixture is stirred vigorously for 2 hours at 
— 78 °C and then allowed to equilibrate to room temperature (1 hour). The 
reaction mixture is hydrolysed with 4 ml of water and 15 ml of ethanol is 
added; the organoborane is oxidised with 10 ml of 6 m sodium hydroxide and 
1 5 ml of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide (CAUTION) ( 1 ). The aqueous phase 
is saturated with anhydrous potassium carbonate, the organic phase separ- 
ated, and the aqueous phase extracted with two 20-ml portions of ether. The 
combined extracts are dried (MgS0 4 ). Gas-liquid chromatography analysis 
indicates the presence of the ds-alcohol in &gt;99.5 per cent isomeric purity. 
The volatile solvents and the isoamyl alcohol were removed under reduced 
pressure to give 3.65 g (98%) of essentially pure ds-4-t-butylcyclohexanol as a

placed borane-dimethyl sulphide complex (1.0ml, lO.Ommol). Tetrahydro- 
furan (32.5 ml) is added and the flask immersed in an ice bath. Butyllithium in 
hexane (1.5 m, 6.6 ml, 9.9 mmol) is slowly added to the flask with vigorous 
stirring, and the resulting solution is stirred for an additional 30 minutes to 
give a solution of lithium n-butylborohydride (0.25 m) in tetrahydrofuran- 
hexane. The hydride concentration is determined by hydrolysing a known ali- 
quot of the solution with a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and 0.5 m sulphuric 
acid at room temperature and measuring the volume of hydrogen evolved.

In a 25-ml flask with a magnetic stirrer and a rubber septum under a dry 
nitrogen atmosphere 4-t-butylcyclohexanone (72 mg, 0.47 mmol) is placed, 
and tetrahydrofuran (2.7 ml) is added. To the resulting solution in a dry-ice- 
acetone bath under a dry nitrogen atmosphere is added dropwise a solution 
of lithium n-butylborohydride (1.8 ml of a 0.25 m solution, 0.45 mmol) in 
tetrahydrofuran-hexane. After 2 hours of being stirred at — 78 °C, the reac- 
tion mixture is hydrolysed with water (0.5 ml), allowed to warm to room tem- 
perature, and oxidised with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution (3 ml) and 
30 per cent hydrogen peroxide (2 ml, CAUTION) (1) by stirring overnight at 
room temperature. After diethyl ether (10 ml) is introduced, the aqueous layer 
is separated and extracted three times with ether. The combined organic 
layers are washed with sodium hydrogen sulphite solution and saturated 
sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, and 
evaporated to dryness to give the corresponding alcohol (72 mg, 98%). The 
product is subjected to g.l.c. analysis (2.1 m x 3.7 mm, 10% Carbowax 20 m 
column at 125 °C) which shows 98 per cent of the trans alcohol and 2 per cent 
of the cis alcohol.

Pinacol hydrate. Place 20 g (0.83 mol) of dry magnesium turnings and 200 ml 
of anhydrous benzene (CAUTION) in a dry, 1 -litre two-necked flask, fitted 
with a dropping funnel and an efficient double surface condenser (Fig. 2.55) 
and carrying calcium chloride guard-tubes. Place a solution of 22.5 g of 
mercury(n) chloride (POISONOUS) in 100 g (127 ml, 1.72 mol) of dry 
AnalaR acetone in the funnel and run in about one-quarter of this solution; if 
the reaction does not commence in a few minutes, as indicated by a vigorous 
ebullition, warm the flask on a water bath and be ready to cool the flask in 
running water to moderate the reaction. Once the reaction has started, no 
further heating is required. Add the remainder of the solution at such a rate 
that the reaction is as vigorous as possible and yet under control. When all 
the mercury(n) chloride solution has been run in and while the mixture is still 
refluxing, add a mixture of 50 g (63.5 ml, 0.86 mol) of dry AnalaR acetone and 
50 ml of dry benzene. When the reaction slows down, warm the flask on a 
water bath for 1-2 hours. During this period the magnesium pinacolate swells 
up and nearly fills the flask. Cool slightly, disconnect the flask from the con- 
denser and shake until the solid mass is well broken up: it may be necessary to 
use a stirrer. Attach the condenser and reflux for about 1 hour, or until the 
magnesium has disappeared. 

Now add 50 ml of water through the dropping funnel and heat again on 
the water bath for 1 hour with occasional shaking. This converts the magne- 

527 



5.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



sium pinacolate into pinacol (soluble in benzene) and a precipitate of magne- 
sium hydroxide. Allow the reaction mixture to cool to 50 °C and filter at the 
pump. Return the solid to the flask and reflux with a fresh 125 ml portion of 
benzene for 10 minutes in order to extract any remaining pinacol; filter and 
combine with the first filtrate. Distil the combined extracts to one-half the 
original volume in order to remove the acetone: treat the residual benzene 
solution with 75 ml of water and cool in an ice bath, or to at least 10-15 °C, 
with good stirring. After 30-60 minutes, filter the pinacol hydrate which has 
separated at the pump and wash it with benzene to remove small quantities of 
mercury compound present as impurities. Dry the pinacol hydrate by expo- 
sure to air at the laboratory temperature. The yield is 90 g (48%), m.p. 
45.5 °C. This product is sufficiently pure for most purposes. The crude pinacol 
hydrate may be purified by dissolving it in an equal weight of boiling water, 
treating with a little decolourising charcoal if necessary, filtering the hot solu- 
tion and cooling in ice; the recovery is over 95 per cent. 

Pinacol. Pinacol hydrate may be dehydrated in the following manner (com- 
pare Section 2.23, p. 168, Drying by distillation). Mix 100 g of pinacol hydrate 
with 200 ml of benzene (CAUTION) and distil; a mixture of water and 
benzene passes over. Separate the lower layer and return the upper layer of 
benzene to the distilling flask. Repeat the process until the benzene distillate 
is clear. Finally distil the anhydrous pinacol and collect the fraction boiling at 
169-173 °C (50 g). The pure pinacol has m.p. 43 °C, but on exposure to moist 
air the m.p. gradually falls to 29-30 °C and then rises to 45-46 °C when 
hydration to the hexahydrate is complete.

Method A. Irradiation with sunlight. Dissolve 10 g (0.055 mol) of benzophe- 
none in 50 ml of propan-2-ol in a 100-ml round-bottomed Pyrex flask by 
slight warming, and add one drop of glacial acetic acid. Add further quanti- 
ties of propan-2-ol, cooling to room temperature, until the solution is about 
6 mm below the bottom of the flask joint. Stopper the flask, taking care that 
none of the solution contaminates the joint, cover the stopper and joint with 
aluminium foil and place the flask in direct sunlight. Colourless crystals begin 
to separate within 24 hours. Allow the flask to remain in the sunlight until no 
further solid appears to separate (about 8 days). Cool the solution in ice- 
water and collect the product by suction filtration, wash it with about 10 ml 
of ice-cold propan-2-ol and dry. About 9.28 g (92%) of almost pure benzo- 
pinacol, m.p. 180-182 °C, is obtained. It may be recrystallised from glacial 
acetic acid (about 80 ml) from which it separates as colourless needles, m.p. 
185-186 °C; the yield is 8.1 g (81%). 

Method B. Irradiation with a mercury arc lamp. Use the 100 watt medium- 
pressure mercury arc lamp with the Pyrex outer and inner jackets (Section 
2.17.5, p. Ill) and a reaction vessel of approximately 110ml capacity (Fig. 
2.67(f)). Make up a solution of 10 g (0.055 mol) of benzophenone in about 
1 10 ml of propan-2-ol containing one drop of glacial acetic acid as described 



528 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.4 



above. Place this solution in the reactor vessel, together with a magnetic fol- 
lower bar, and irradiate the vigorously stirred solution under an atmosphere 
of nitrogen. Benzopinacol begins to separate within half an hour. As the 
quantity of product increases it gradually collects on the surface of the Pyrex 
jacket which thus restricts the amount of light reaching the solution. There- 
fore, after about 2-3 hours, switch off the lamp, raise the lamp insert from the 
reaction mixture and carefully scrape off the solid into the reactor vessel. 
Collect the product (about 4 g) by vacuum filtration, wash it with a few ml of 
cold propan-2-ol and dry. Return the filtrate to the reaction vessel. Clean the 
lamp insert with paper tissue moistened with ethanol and dry, and replace it 
in the reaction vessel. Continue the irradiation as above until a further appre- 
ciable quantity of product has separated (about 2 hours) and collect as 
before. Repeat this procedure until no further solid separates from the reac- 
tion mixture. About four crops of material will be obtained during a total 
irradiation period of 8 hours. The yield of benzopinacol, m.p. 178-182 °C, is 
about 8.65 g (75%). It may be purified by recrystallisation from glacial acetic 
acid as described above.

Fit the central neck of a 1 -litre two-necked flask with an efficient double sur- 
face condenser and close the side-neck with a stopper. Place 52 g (59.5 ml, 
0.4mol) of ethyl pentanoate (Expt 5.152) and 800 ml of super-dry ethanol (1) 
(Section 4.1.9, p. 401) in the flask. Add 95 g (4.1 mol) of clean sodium (Section 
4.2.65, p. 462) in small pieces through the aperture at such a rate that the 
vigorous refluxing is continuous (20-30 minutes). Reflux the mixture in an oil 
bath for 1 hour in order to be certain that all the sodium has dissolved. Re- 
place the reflux condenser by an efficient fractionating column (e.g. Hempel 
or all-glass Dufton column, etc.) and set the condenser for downward distilla- 
tion. Fractionate the mixture from an oil bath; about 250 ml of absolute etha- 
nol are thus recovered. Treat the residue, consisting of pentanol and sodium 
ethoxide, with 330 ml of water and continue the distillation (oil bath at 1 10— 
120 °C) until the temperature at the top of the column reaches 83 °C, indicat- 
ing that practically all the ethanol has been removed; about 600 ml of approx- 
imately 90 per cent ethanol are recovered. Remove the fractionating column 
and steam distil the mixture (Fig. 2.102); about 200 ml must be collected 
before all the pentan-1-ol is removed. Separate the crude pentanol, dry it over 
anhydrous potassium carbonate or anhydrous calcium sulphate and distil 
through a short column. Collect the fraction boiling at 137-139 °C. The yield 
of pentan-1-ol is 25 g (71%). 

Note. (1) The ethanol must be absolute; a lower grade gives a poor yield. 

Cognate preparations. 2-Phenylethanol. Prepare a suspension of 42 g 
(1.83 mol) of sodium in 120 ml of sodium -dried toluene in a 3-litre three- 
necked flask following the procedure described in Method 2 under Sodium, 
Section 4.2.65, p. 462. Do not decant the toluene; when the mixture has 
cooled to about 60 °C, add a solution of 50 g (0.30 mol) of ethyl phenylacetate 
(Expt 5.152) in 150g (190ml) of super-dry ethanol (Section 4.1.9, p. 401) as

rapidly as possible without allowing the reaction to get out of control. Then 
add a further 200 g (253 ml) of super -dry ethanol. When the reaction has sub- 
sided, heat the flask in a water bath until the sodium is completely dissolved 
Distil off the ethanol and toluene under reduced pressure using a rotary evap- 
orator. Dilute the residue with water and extract the phenylethanol with 
ether, dry the extract with magnesium sulphate, remove the solvent and distil 
the residual oil under reduced pressure. Collect the 2-phenylethanol at 116- 
118°C/25mmHg. The yield is 25 g (67%). 

The alcohol may be purified by conversion into the calcium chloride addi- 
tion compound. Treat it with anhydrous calcium chloride; much heat is 
evolved and the addition compound is formed. After several hours, remove 
any oil which has not reacted by washing with petroleum ether (b.p. 60- 
80 °C). Decompose the solid with ice-water, separate the alcohol, dry and 
distil. 

Butane-1 ,4-diol (Tetramethylene glycol). Place 60 g (2.6 mol) of clean sodium 
in a 3-litre three-necked flask fitted with two efficient double surface con- 
densers and a dropping funnel protected by a calcium chloride tube. Add 
from the dropping funnel a solution of 35 g (0.2 mol) of diethyl succinate in 
700 ml of super-dry ethanol (Section 4.1.9, p. 401) as rapidly as possible con- 
sistent with the reaction being under control; it may be necessary to immerse 
the flask momentarily in a freezing mixture. When the vigorous action has 
subsided, warm the mixture on a water bath or in an oil bath at 130 °C until 
all the sodium has reacted (30-60 minutes). Allow to cool and cautiously add 
25 ml of water (1); reflux for a further 30 minutes to bring all the solid into 
solution and to hydrolyse any remaining ester. Add 270 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid to the cold reaction mixture, cool in ice, filter off the pre- 
cipitated sodium chloride and treat the filtrate with 300 g of anhydrous potas- 
sium carbonate to free it from water and acid. Filter the alcoholic solution 
through a large sintered glass funnel, and extract the solid twice with boiling 
ethanol. Distil off the ethanol from the combined solutions; towards the end 
of the distillation solid salts will separate. Add dry acetone, filter and distil off 
the acetone. Distil the residue under diminished pressure, and collect the 
butane- 1 ,4-diol at 133-135 "C/18 mmHg. The yield is 13 g (72%). Record the 
p.m.r. spectrum (DMSO-d 6 ) and assign the signals that are observed at 5 1.43 
[m(A 2 B 2 ), 4H], 3.39 (d of t, 4H) and 4.34 (t, 2H). 

Note. (1) Alternatively, the following procedure for isolating the diol may be used. 
Dilute the partly cooled mixture with 250 ml of water, transfer to a distilling flask, and 
distil from an oil bath until the temperature reaches 95 °C. Transfer the hot residue to 
an apparatus for continuous extraction with ether (e.g. Fig. 2.93). The extraction is a 
slow process (36-48 hours) as the diol is not very soluble in ether. Distil off the ether 
and, after removal of the water and ethanol, distil the diol under reduced pressure.

with a sealed stirrer unit, a 250-ml dropping funnel and a double surface con- 
denser (see Fig. 2.56); attach guard-tubes containing calcium chloride to the 
open ends of the condenser and the dropping funnel. The mechanical stirrer 
should be a powerful one. It must be emphasised that all operations, includ- 
ing weighing, with solid lithium aluminium hydride must be conducted in the 
fume cupboard; during weighing, etc., the front of the fume chamber is pulled 
down so that there is a narrow opening to allow the hands to enter (see also 
Section 4.2.49, p. 446, for additional precautions and methods for removal of 
traces of reagent). 

Remove the dropping funnel from the flask neck and replace it by a funnel 
with a very short wide stem and introduce 10.5 g (0.263 mol) of powdered lith- 
ium aluminium hydride into the flask through this funnel, and use about 
300 ml of sodium-dried ether to transfer the last traces into the flask. Replace 
the dropping funnel and guard-tube. Set the stirrer in motion, and place a 
solution of 50.5 g (0.25 mol) of freshly distilled diethyl adipate, b.p. 133— 
135 °C/14mmHg (Expt 5.144), in 150ml of anhydrous ether in the dropping 
funnel. After stirring for 10 minutes (some of the lithium aluminium hydride 
may remain undissolved), add the diethyl adipate solution so that the ether 
refluxes gently; the reaction mixture rapidly becomes viscous and four 50 ml 
portions of anhydrous ether must be added during the reduction to facilitate 
stirring. Continue the stirring for 10 minutes after the diethyl adipate has 
been added. Decompose the excess of lithium aluminium hydride by the 
dropwise addition, with sitrring, either of 75 ml of water, or, preferably, by the 
more rapid addition of 22 g (24.5 ml) of ethyl acetate (1). Filter the reaction 
product from the sludge through a sintered glass funnel; dry the ethereal solu- 
tion with magnesium sulphate and distil off the ether with a rotary evapor- 
ator. The colourless viscous residue (18.5 g) solidifies completely on cooling 
and has m.p. 41-42 °C, i.e. is pure hexane-l,6-diol. Dissolve the sludge 
remaining in the filter funnel in 20 per cent sulphuric acid, extract the result- 
ing solution with six 100 ml portions of ether, or use a continuous ether 
extractor (Fig. 2.92). Remove the ether by means of a rotary evaporator; the 
residue (6g) crystallises completely on cooling, m.p. 41-42 °C. The total yield 
of hexane-l,6-diol is 24.5 g (91%). 

Note. (1) Before adding water, remove the calcium chloride tubes and fit the reflux 
condenser with a long tube extending to the duct at the top of the fume cupboard; this 
will carry the escaping hydrogen above the motor of the stirrer. A spark -proof stirring 
motor is recommended and should be used, if available. The dropwise addition of 
water must be conducted while the mixture is stirred vigorously; foaming may occur 
and the reaction may be moderated by filling the bath surrounding the reaction vessel 
with cold water.

Primary, secondary or tertiary alcohols may be prepared by the reaction of a 
suitable carbonyl-containing compound with an alkylmagnesium halide (a 
Grignard reagent). The reagent is usually obtained quite readily by adding an 
alkyl halide (the bromide is frequently preferred) to a suspension of magnesium 
turnings in anhydrous ether. Initiation of the reaction may require the addition 
of a few crystals of iodine, the purpose of which may be to form a catalytic 

531 



5.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



amount of magnesium iodide or possible simply to etch the metal surface. As it is 
important that the iodine should be concentrated at the metal surface the mix- 
ture should not be stirred at this stage. The resulting alkylmagnesium halide is 
soluble in the ether solvent as a result of coordination of two ether molecules 
onto the magnesium, and may be represented by formula (9).

Other ethereal solvents (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dibutyl ether) may also be used; 
indeed tetrahydrofuran is the required solvent for the formation of vinylmag- 
nesium halides. 

The true structural nature of the reactive species in solution is uncertain and 

/&gt;- /&gt; + 
for convenience the reagent may be represented as a polarised species, R — MgX 
[see p. 21 for a discussion of reversed polarity ('umpolung')]- The reaction with 
the carbonyl group of an aldehyde, ketone, or ester may then be represented as a 
nucleophilic addition process in the following way. 




The summary of retrosynthetic strategies (p. 518) indicates the molar equival- 
ents of Grignard reagent required for the formation of: (a) primary alcohols 
from either formaldehyde (obtained by the depolymerisation of paraformalde- 
hyde), or from ethylene oxide; (b) symmetrical or unsymmetrical secondary 
alcohols from aldehydes, or symmetrical secondary alcohols from ethyl formate; 
and (c) various symmetrical and unsymmetrical tertiary alcohols from ketones, 
or from esters other than ethyl formate, or from diethyl carbonate. Full repres- 
entative equations showing the intermediates for these reactions are given in the 
preparative accounts, namely Expt 5.39 [for (a)], Expt 5.40 [for (by], and Expts 
5.41 to 5.43 [for (c)]. Table 5.1 summarises the possible disconnections to give 
the specific reagents required for the various preparations which are described; 
the choice of route is based on the availability or convenience of handling of the 
reagents. Table 5.1 also includes examples for the preparation of alkenols and 
alkynols from vinylic and acetylenic Grignard reagents. An alternative route to 
alkynols involves the use of an alkynylsodium which is formed by the action of 
sodamide on a terminal alkyne. 

Two principal approaches to the synthesis of an optically pure chiral second- 
ary or tertiary alcohol from the reaction of an organometallic reagent with an 
aldehyde or ketone respectively are of current interest. In the first approach an 
alkyllithium or dialkylmagnesium is initially complexed with a chiral reagent 
which then reacts with the carbonyl compound. In this way two diastereo- 
isomeric transition states are generated, the more stable of which leads to an 
enantiometic excess of the optically active alcohol. This approach is similar in 
principle to the asymmetric reductions discussed in Section 5.4.1 (see also 
p. 15). Two chiral catalysts may be noted as successful examples, (10) derived

In the second approach the carbonyl function is incorporated in a chiral 
adjuvant (or auxiliary) which then stereoselectively directs a preferred attack of 
the organometallic reagent on the si- or re-faces of the carbonyl group, as deter- 
mined by steric and electronic interactions. This results in two diastereoisomeric 
products in a ratio dependent on the relative free energies of activation. One 
such auxiliary is (12), derived from the readily available and optically pure 
( + )-pulegone.

In a multistage reaction (12) is converted into the acyloxathiane (13); sub- 
sequent reaction with a Grignard reagent (R 2 MgX) takes place preferentially at 
the re-face of the carbonyl group. The product of this reaction is decomposed to 
give the a-hydroxy aldehyde, R'R^COH^CHO, this then being reduced to the 
diol, R 1 R 2 C(OH)-CH 2 OH, from whence the primary hydroxyl function is elab- 
orated to a methyl group by reduction of the monotosylate. In this way tertiary 
alcohols of the type R 1 R 2 C(OH)-Me may be synthesised in high optical yield. 61 
Other chiral auxiliaries have been employed in this strategy for the synthesis 
of optically active alcohols. 62

flask so that it may be heated on an oil bath. Place 26.7 g (1.1 mol) of magne- 
sium turnings (1) and a crystal of iodine in the flask. Measure out in separate 
vessels 1 18.5 g (121 ml, 1.0 mol) of cyclohexyl chloride (Expt 5.51) and 450 ml 
of dibutyl ether. Introduce about 100 ml of pure, dry, dibutyl ether (Section 
4.1.77, p. 406) and 15 ml of the chloride into the flask. Warm the flask gently 
to initiate the reaction and if necessary add a further crystal of iodine. The 
onset of the reaction is accompanied by the disappearance of the iodine 
colour, the development of cloudiness and bubbles being released from the 
metal surface. When the reaction is progressing well, add sufficient dibutyl 
ether to cover the magnesium and set the stirrer in motion. Add dropwise the 
remainder of the cyclohexyl chloride dissolved in the remainder of the dibutyl 
ether at such a rate that the reaction proceeds smoothly. When the solution 
commences to cool and only a small amount of metal remains, remove the 
funnel and replace it with the solids addition system containing lOOg 
(c. 3.3 mol) of dry paraformaldehyde (2). Heat the reaction mixture to 100- 
110°C and add the paraformaldehyde in small portions over 2 hours to the 
well-stirred solution. Continue the heating and stirring for a further half-an- 
hour. Cool the mixture, add 300 g of finely crushed ice and agitate the mixture 
until decomposition is complete. Add twice the theoretical quantity of 30 per 
cent sulphuric acid to dissolve the magnesium hydroxide, and then steam dis- 
til the mixture until no more oil passes over (2000-2500 ml). Saturate the 
distillate with sodium chloride and separate the upper organic layer. Dry 
with anhydrous potassium carbonate and distil under reduced pressure using 
a fractionating column; collect the first fraction of dibutyl ether and then a 
second fraction of cyclohexylmethanol. Add 5 g of freshly dehydrated calcium 
oxide to the alcohol fraction and heat on a water bath for 30 minutes; this will 
remove last traces of unreacted halogen compound. Filter, redistil under 
reduced pressure and collect the fraction of b.p. 88-93 °C/1 8 mmHg; the yield 
is 70 g (66%). The boiling point of cyclohexylmethanol at atmospheric pres- 
sure is 182 °C. 

Note. (1) Commerical magnesium turnings for the Grignard reaction should be 
washed with sodium-dried ether to remove traces of surface grease which may be 
present, dried at 100 °C and allowed to cool in a desiccator. 
(2) Dry the material in a desiccator over phosphoric oxide for 2 days.

CAUTION: Owing to the toxicity of ethylene oxide and of benzene all opera- 
tions must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard. 

Equip a 2-litre three-necked flask as above; the solids addition system is 
not required but the gas inlet system described below should be assembled for 
use in the latter stages of the experiment. An appropriate water bath should 
be used for heating. Place 37.5 g (1.54 mol) of washed and dried magnesium 
turnings and 300 ml of sodium dried ether in the flask and add a small crystal 
of iodine. Prepare a solution of 205.5 g (161 ml, 1.50mol) of pure dry butyl 
bromide (Expt 5.54) in 300 ml of dry ether in the separatory funnel and intro- 
duce about 25 ml of the solution into the flask. As soon as the reaction com- 
mences (disappearance of the iodine colour), set the stirrer in motion and add 

535 



5.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the remainder of the butyl bromide solution at such a rate that steady reflux- 
ing of the reaction mixture is maintained (if the reaction becomes too vigor- 
ous it should be moderated by momentarily cooling the flask in an ice bath). 
When the addition is complete, maintain gentle reflux, with the aid of a hot- 
water bath if necessary, until most of the magnesium has reacted (about 15- 
30 minutes). Cool the flask in a freezing mixture of ice and salt. Remove the 
separatory funnel and replace it by a tube, 4 mm in diameter, the end of which 
is about 2 cm above the surface of the liquid. Attach this delivery tube to a 
flask fitted with 'wash bottle' tubes, the long tube being nearer the three- 
necked flask and the other end being connected to a supply of dry nitrogen. 
Cool this flask in a mixture of ice and salt and introduce rapidly 90 g 
(2.02 mol) of ethylene oxide (1) from a lOOg sealed bulb of the reagent 
(Section 4.2.25, p. 434); the latter must, of course, be cooled in an ice and salt 
mixture before opening (2). Gradually introduce the ethylene oxide into the 
reaction flask over a period of 1.5-2 hours; the temperature should not rise 
above 10 °C. When all has been added, remove the freezing mixture sur- 
rounding the three-necked flask. The temperature of the mixture will gradu- 
ally rise and the reaction mixture will boil gently. When boiling ceases, reflux 
on a water bath for 30 minutes. Allow to cool, insert a thermometer into a 
neck of the flask, arrange the condenser for downward distillation and collect 
250 ml of ether in a measuring cylinder; do not collect a larger volume of ether 
as a violent reaction may set in, apparently due to a rearrangement of the 
initial reaction product, and considerable loss may ensue. Change the 
receiver, and introduce 250 ml of sodium-dried benzene (CAUTION) into the 
reaction mixture. Continue the distillation with stirring until the temperature 
of the distilling vapour reaches 65 °C. Then boil the mixture under reflux for 
30 minutes; generally by this time the mixture has become so viscous that stir- 
ring is no longer very effective. Allow to cool. Decompose the reaction mix- 
ture with 500 ml of an ice-water mixture, and dissolve the precipitated 
magnesium hydroxide with 30 per cent sulphuric acid; add sufficient finely- 
crushed ice to keep the mixture cold. Steam distil and collect about 2 litres of 
distillate. Separate the oily layer (A), and distil the aqueous layer until free of 
hexan-1-ol; add the oil so obtained to (A). Stir the crude hexan-1-ol on a 
water bath with 250 ml of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and steam 
distil again as before. Dry the oil with a little anhydrous calcium sulphate, 
distil through an efficient fractionating column and collect the fraction, b.p. 
154-1 57 °C. The yield of hexan-1-ol is 90 g (49%). 

Notes. (1) It is advisable to cool and open the ampoule of ethylene oxide behind a 
safety screen in a fume cupboard, and to wear plastic gloves and goggles. 
(2) Instead of adding the liquid ethylene oxide (b.p. 10.5 °C), the latter may be dis- 
solved in 100 ml of ice-cold anhydrous ether; this solution is added directly to the reac- 
tion mixture during 1 5-30 minutes. The yield however is somewhat lower. 

Nonan-1-ol (primary alcohol from ethylene oxide). Prepare a Grignard 
reagent from 24.5g (1 mol) of magnesium turnings, 179g (157ml, 1 mol) of 
1-bromoheptane (Expt 5.55) and 300 ml of dibutyl ether as described above. 
Cool the solution to °C and, with vigorous stirring, add an excess of ethy- 
lene oxide. Maintain the temperature to °C for 1 hour after the ethylene 
oxide has been introduced, then allow the temperature to rise to 40 °C and 
maintain the mixture at this temperature for 1 hour. Finally heat the mixture

on a water bath for 2 hours. Decompose the addition product by pouring the 
cooled reaction mixture into ice-water, acidify with sulphuric acid to dissolve 
the precipitated magnesium hydroxide and isolate the reaction products as 
described in the procedure for hexan-1-ol. Collect the nonan-1-ol at b.p. 
95-100 °C/12mmHg; the yield is 95 g (69%).

200 ml of anhydrous ether; use a 1 -litre flask equipped as in Expt 5.39, and 
follow the broad experimental details given in the cognate preparation of 
Expt 5.39. Cool the resulting Grignard reagent to — 10 to — 5 °C in a freezing 
mixture of crushed ice and anhydrous calcium chloride. Remove the separa- 
tory funnel and re-attach to the flask via a two-necked adapter to allow the 
introduction of a thermometer for monitoring the reaction temperature. Add 
a solution of 67 g (83.5 ml, 1.53 mol) of freshly distilled acetaldehyde (b.p. 
20.5-21 °C) in 90 ml of anhydrous ether over a period of 30 minutes. Do not 
allow the temperature to rise above — 5 °C. When all the acetaldehyde has 
been added, pour the reaction product upon 700 g of crushed ice; any excess 
of magnesium should remain in the flask. Dissolve the basic magnesium 
bromide by the addition of 350 ml of 15 per cent sulphuric acid. Separate the 
ethereal solution and extract the aqueous layer with four 50 ml portions of 
ether. Dry the combined ethereal solutions over 8 g of anhydrous potassium 
carbonate (or the equivalent quantity of anhydrous calcium sulphate), and 
fractionally distil through an all-glass Dufton (or other efficient fractionating) 
column. Collect the 3-methylbutan-2-ol at 110-111.5 °C. The yield is 70g

the ice bath and continue the stirring for 10 minutes. 

Place 35 ml of water in the separatory funnel and run it into the vigorously

tion of 58 g (73.5 ml, 1 mol) of dry acetone in 75 ml of anhydrous ether. Allow 
the reaction mixture to stand overnight. Decompose the product by pouring 
it on to 500 g of crushed ice; dissolve the precipitated magnesium compounds 
by the addition of 10 per cent hydrochloric acid or of 15 per cent sulphuric 
acid. Transfer to a separatory funnel, remove the ether layer and extract the 
aqueous solution with three 50 ml portions of ether. Dry the combined ether- 
eal solutions over anhydrous potassium carbonate or anhydrous calcium sul- 
phate, filter, distil off the ether, and fractionally distil the residue. Collect the 
2-methylhexan-2-ol at 137-141 °C. The yield is 105 g (90%). Assign the 13 C-

trans-l-Ethynyl-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexan-l-ol (tertiary alcohol from a

bottomed flask mounted on a magnetic stirrer unit and equipped with a gas 
inlet tube terminating in a glass frit for the passage of acetone-free acetylene 
(Expt 5.26), and a dropping funnel protected with a calcium chloride guard-

of pure tetrahydrofuran (Section 4.1.79, p. 406) and a magnetic follower. 
Saturate the tetrahydrofuran with acetylene by passing a rapid stream of the 
gas through the solvent. Then with the continued passage of acetylene, add 
dropwise from the funnel over 2 hours a previously prepared solution of 
ethylmagnesium bromide [from 16.4g (0.15 mol) of ethyl bromide, 3.7 g 
(0.1 54 mol) of magnesium in 100 ml of tetrahydrofuran]. Cool the reaction 
mixture to °C and add with stirring a solution of 7 g (0.05 mol) of 3,3,5- 
trimethylcyclohexanone in 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran; the slow passage of

it into a mixture of 80 g of ammonium chloride and 200 g of crushed ice. 
Separate the organic layer and extract the aqueous layer with three 25 ml por- 
tions of tetrahydrofuran. Evaporate the tetrahydrofuran from the combined 
organic layers, dissolve the residue in 100 ml of ether, dry the solution over 
magnesium sulphate and evaporate the solvent on a rotary evaporator. Distil 
(Fig. 2.108) the residue and collect the alkynol at b.p. 78-79 °C/8 mmHg; this 
crystallises on standing and has m.p. 26-27 °C. The yield is 5.6 g (70%). The

l,l,3-Triphenylprop-2-yn-l-ol {tertiary alcohol from a ketone). Prepare a solu- 
tion of ethylmagnesium bromide in 50 ml of anhydrous ether from 27.3 g 
(19 ml, 0.25 mol) of ethyl bromide, 6.0 g (0.25 mol) of magnesium. Cool the 
solution and add dropwise a solution of 25.5 g (27 ml, 0.25 mol) of phenyl- 
acetylene (Expt 5.24) in 30 ml of anhydrous ether. Boil the reaction mixture 
gently under reflux for 2 hours and cool to room temperature. Start the 
stirrer, add slowly a solution of 45.5 g (0.25 mol) of benzophenone in 50 ml of 
anhydrous ether, and continue to stir at room temperature for 1.5 hours. 
Finally boil under reflux for 1 hour and cool in an ice bath. Liberate the prod- 
uct by adding slowly 55 g of ammonium chloride as a saturated aqueous solu- 
tion, separate the ether layer and extract the aqueous phase with two 20 ml 
portions of ether. Dry the combined ether solutions over anhydrous sodium 
sulphate, and remove the ether on a rotary evaporator. Cool the residual oil 
in ice and triturate with light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) until the triphenyl- 
propynol crystallises (1), and recrystallise it from a mixture of benzene and 
light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C). The yield is 35 g (49%), m.p. 78-80 °C. 

Note. (1) If the product fails to crystallise, purify it by distillation under reduced pres- 
sure, b.p. 190 °C/0.05 mmHg. 

1-Vinylcyclobutanol {tertiary alcohol from a ketone). 6 * A dry, three-necked, 
250-ml flask under a nitrogen atmosphere is equipped with a mechanical 
stirrer, dry-ice condenser, and a small additional funnel. The apparatus is 
charged with magnesium (7.29 g, 0.30 mol) and dry tetrahydrofuran (25 ml). 
In the addition funnel is placed vinyl bromide (37.5 g, 0.350 mol) in dry tetra- 
hydrofuran (75 ml) and about 2 ml of this solution is added to the flask with 
very rapid stirring to initiate the reaction. After initiation, the remaining vinyl 
bromide is added slowly to maintain steady reflux. Once all the magnesium 
has been consumed, the mixture is cooled to 35 °C and a solution of cyclo- 
butanone (14.0g, 0.2 mol) (Expt 7.13) in dry tetrahydrofuran (30 ml) is added 
slowly. The dry-ice condenser is replaced by a normal condenser and the 
solution is refluxed for 90 minutes. After the flask is cooled to 35 °C, saturated 
ammonium chloride solution (40 ml) is added dropwise with additional cool- 
ing and vigorous stirring to effect hydrolysis of the magnesium salts. These 
salts are collected by suction filtration and washed well with anhydrous ether. 
The combined filtrate is dried over magnesium sulphate and filtered and the 
solvent removed on the rotary evaporator. Distillation affords 12.89 g (66%)

aqueous solution with two 150 ml portions of ether. Wash the combined 
ethereal extracts with dilute sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, followed 
by a little water, then dry with anhydrous potassium carbonate or anhydrous 
calcium sulphate, distil off the ether on a water bath and distil the residue 
through a short fractionating column. Collect the 2-methylpentan-2-ol at 
1 17-1 20 °C. A further small quantity of the tertiary alcohol may be obtained 
by redrying the low-boiling distillate, filtering and redistilling. The yield is 
90 g (88%). 

Note. (1) Ethyl butanoate may be prepared as described in Expt 5.142. 

Cognate preparations. 2-Methylbutan-2-ol {tertiary alcohol from an ester).

Triphenylmethanol (tertiary alcohol from an ester). Prepare a solution of 
phenylmagnesium bromide from 14 g (0.57 mol) of magnesium turnings, 
90.5 g (60.5 ml, 0.57 mol) of dried redistilled bromobenzene and 250 ml of 
anhydrous ether. Treat this Grignard reagent with a solution of 37.5 g (36 ml, 
0.25 mol) of dry ethyl benzoate (Expt 6.163) in 100 ml of sodium-dried ben- 
zene (CAUTION) following the procedure described above. Decompose the 
reaction product by pouring it slowly, with constant stirring, into a mixture 
of 750 g of crushed ice and 25 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. Continue the 
stirring until all the solid dissolves; it may be necessary to add 25 g of solid 
ammonium chloride to facilitate the decomposition of the magnesium com- 
plex, and also a little more benzene to dissolve all the product. When all the 
solids have passed into solution, separate the benzene layer and wash it suc- 
cessively with 100 ml of water, 100 ml of 5 per cent sodium bicarbonate solu- 
tion and 100 ml of water. Remove the benzene as completely as possible from 
a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask using a rotary evaporator; steam distil the 
residue (Fig. 2.102) in order to separate unchanged bromobenzene and 
biphenyl (by-product). Filter the cold residue in the flask at the pump, wash it 
with water and dry. The resulting crude triphenylmethanol weighs 62 g. 
Recrystallise it from carbon tetrachloride (4 ml per gram of solid): the first

and cool in ice: a further 3 g of pure triphenylmethanol is obtained.

In a 1 -litre three-necked flask, equipped as in Expt 5.39, prepare a solution of 
ethylmagnesium bromide from 36.5 g (1.50 mol) of magnesium turnings, 163 g 
(112 ml, 1.50 mol) of ethyl bromide and 600 ml of anhydrous ether, following 
the general procedure outlined in Expt 5.39. Run into the resulting ethereal 
Grignard reagent a solution of 52 g (53.5 ml, 0.44 mol) of pure diethyl car- 
bonate (Section 4.2.26, p. 433) in 70 ml of anhydrous ether, with rapid stirring, 
over a period of about 1 hour. A vigorous reaction sets in and the ether 
refluxes continually. When the diethyl carbonate has been added, heat the 
flask on a water bath with stirring for another hour. Pour the reaction mix- 
ture, with frequent shaking, into a 2-litre round-bottomed flask containing 
500 g of crushed ice and a solution of 100 g of ammonium chloride in 200 ml 
of water. Transfer to a separatory funnel, remove the ether layer and extract 
the aqueous solution with two 175 ml portions of ether. Dry the combined 
ethereal extracts with anhydrous potassium carbonate or with anhydrous 
calcium sulphate, and remove the ether on a water bath. Distil the alcohol 
through a short fractionating column and collect the fraction boiling at 139— 
142 °C as pure 3-ethylpentan-3-ol. A further small quantity may be obtained 
by drying the low boiling fraction with 2 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate 
or anhydrous calcium sulphate, filtering and redistilling. The total yield is 
44 g (86%). 

The following tertiary alcohols may be prepared similarly from the appro- 
priate Grignard reagent and diethyl carbonate in yields of 75-80 per cent; 4- 
propylheptan-4-ol, b.p. 89-92 °C/20 mmHg; 5-butylnonan-5-ol, b.p. 129-

Use the same technique as detailed for Expt 5.26 but with a 3-litre three- 
necked flask. Charge the flask with 1.5 litres of liquid ammonia. Prepare the 
sodamide using 0.7 g of iron(m) nitrate and 2g of sodium, followed by 46 g 
(total 2.1 mol) of sodium, and convert it into a solution of sodium acetylide as 
before. Add, with stirring, a solution of 196 g (206 ml, 2 mol) of dry, redistilled 
cyclohexanone (1) in 256 ml of dry ether during 1 hour and continue the stir- 
ring for a further 2 hours. Decompose the sodium derivative of the product by 
the gradual addition of a slight excess (1 18 g) of powdered ammonium chlor- 
ide. Allow to stand overnight, preferably with stirring, by which time all the

5.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ammonia will have evaporated. Extract the residue repeatedly with ether, i.e. 
until all the alkynol has been separated from the inorganic material (2). Wash 
the ethereal extract successively with water, dilute sulphuric acid and sodium 
hydrogen carbonate solution, dry with magnesium sulphate and distil. 
Collect the 1-ethynylcyclohexanol at 83°C/20mmHg (3); the yield is 210 g 
(85%). 

Notes. (1) Dry the cyclohexanone over excess of anhydrous calcium chloride before 
distillation. 

(2) A continuous ether extractor (Fig. 2.92) is recommended. 

(3) The product has m.p. c. 25 °C, but the m.p. depends upon the purity of the cyclo- 
hexanone and the efficiency of the distillation. Pure 1-ethynylcyclohexanol has m.p. 
32 °C. 

5.4.3 THE HYOROBORATION OXIDATION OF ALKENES 

Borane, as a solution in tetrahydrofuran or generated in situ by the reaction of a 
metal hydride with boron trifluoride etherate, adds readily to alkenes to yield 
trialkylboranes. With a terminal alkene the reaction is highly (though not com- 
pletely) regioselective and gives a primary trialkylborane, since the mode of 
addition results from the electrophilic character of the boron atom. 



C H 2 ► ^%H 2 ^— "^BH ^— ^ ^B 



H^BH 



In the case of internal alkenes, hydroboration may not yield the trialkylborane, 
and the reaction may cease at either the di- or mono-alkylborane stage. The con- 
trolling feature in these cases appears to be the steric hindrance to reaction 
generated by bulky alkyl groups in the alkene; furthermore the regioselectivity 
of these reactions is influenced by both steric and electronic effects. For example 
2-methylbut-2-ene gives disiamylborane (Sia 2 BH; 98% regioselectivity), and 2,3- 
dimethylbut-2-ene gives thexylborane (thexyl-BH 2 ). The preparation of these 
alkylboranes is given in Section 4.2.7, p. 419). 

Me Me , BH Me Me Me BH 2 

Me Me Me Me Me Me Me Me 

These two alkylboranes are important reagents for the hydroboration of other 
alkenes, since they frequently show in this further reaction a regioselectivity 
which is greater than that of borane itself. 

The akylboranes may be converted into a vast range of other functionali- 
ties 64 ; perhaps the most important is their conversion into alcohols by oxidation 
with alkaline peroxide. 

OH + B(OH), 

The oxidation step is usually carried out in situ and is illustrated by the conver- 
sion of hex-1-ene into hexan-1-ol (Expt 5.44); trimethylamine N-oxide has been 
suggested as a safer alternative oxidising reagent. 65 The g.l.c. analysis of the 

542 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.4 



alcohol product reveals the regioselectivity of the hydroboration step. The 
mechanism of the oxidation step involves a 1,2-nucleophilic shift of an alkyl 
group in the hydroperoxide intermediate as shown.

An important consequence of the mechanism of this oxidation is that the stereo- 
isomeric features, resulting from the ds-addition of borane formulated pre- 
viously (above), are retained in the final product, i.e. the overall reaction is 
highly stereospecific. Thus reaction of 1-methylcyclohexene with borane fol- 
lowed by oxidation gives frans-2-methylcyclohexan-l-ol. 66 




H 2 02,,

Reaction of borane (as a complex with dimethyl sulphide) with optically pure 
( + )-a-pinene (in 15% excess) results in the almost exclusive formation of di- 
isopinocampheylborane (Ipc 2 ,BH) 67 (Section 4.1.7, p. 421). The use of this 
optically pure borane in the hydroboration of the prochiral (Z)-but-2-ene, 
followed by oxidation, yields (R)-(-)-butan-2-ol (ee 98.1%) (Expt 5.45). Inter- 
estingly, monoisopinocampheylborane (IpcBH 2 ) with (Z)-but-2-ene gives (S)- 
(+)-butan-2-ol, and hence the importance of careful reagent preparation is 
emphasised. 68

CAUTION: This experiment should be carried out in an efficient fume cup-

Equip a 500-ml three-necked round-bottomed flask (1) with a sealed 
stirrer unit, a 100-ml pressure-equalising funnel fitted with an inlet adapter to 
allow flushing with dry nitrogen, and a two-necked adapter carrying a con- 
denser fitted with a calcium chloride guard-tube, and a thermometer reaching 
to the bottom of the flask. Arrange the apparatus so that it may be cooled 
occasionally in an ice-water bath supported on a laboratory jack. 

543 



5.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Maintain a slow stream of dry nitrogen through the apparatus and place 
in the flask 90 ml of dry diglyme (Section 4.2.18, p. 406), and 3.41 g (0.090mol, 
20% excess over the theoretical requirement of 0.075 mol) of powdered 
sodium borohydride. Stir until most of the borohydride has dissolved then 
add a solution of 25.2 g (0.30 mol) of hex-1-ene in 50 ml of dry diglyme. Place 
17.0g (15.1ml, 0.12 mol; 20% excess over the theoretical requirement of 
0.10 mol) of purified boron trifluoride-etherate (48%, w/w, Section 4.2.5, 
p. 421) in the dropping funnel followed by 25 ml of dry diglyme. Adjust the 
flow of dry nitrogen so that a slow stream is maintained throughout the ex- 
periment. Add the boron trifluoride-etherate in portions to the rapidly 
stirred mixture during 30 minutes while maintaining the temperature at 20- 
25 °C by occasional cooling with the ice-water bath. Continue stirring at 
room temperature for 1 hour to ensure completion of the hydroboration 
reaction. Add 20 ml of water dropwise from the dropping funnel to the reac- 
tion mixture during about 25 minutes to decompose excess sodium boro- 
hydride; vigorous hydrogen evolution may cause foaming during this 
addition. When hydrogen evolution has stopped, place 40 ml (0.35 mol) of 30 
per cent hydrogen peroxide in the dropping funnel. Add 40 ml (0.1 2 mol) of 
3 m aqueous sodium hydroxide in one portion down the condenser to the 
reaction mixture and then add the hydrogen peroxide dropwise keeping the 
temperature at 30-50 °C by cooling in a cold-water bath; this addition should 
take about 25 minutes. Stir the reaction mixture at room temperature for a 
further 1 hour to ensure oxidation is complete and then pour it on to 250 ml 
of ice-water in a separatory funnel. Rinse the reaction vessel with 50 ml of 
water and add to the contents of the funnel. Extract the aqueous mixture with 
two 200 ml portions of ether (some insoluble inorganic material may separate 
in the aqueous layer at this stage) and then wash the combined ethereal 
extracts with eight 50 ml portions of water to remove diglyme (2). Dry the 
ether solution over magnesium sulphate, filter and remove the solvent by 
flash distillation or on the rotary evaporator. Transfer the residual colourless 
liquid to a 100-ml round-bottomed flask and fractionally distil through a 
well-lagged 14 cm column filled with glass helices, collecting the fraction, b.p. 
154-1 57 °C. The product is hexan-1-ol containing approximately 6 per cent 
of hexan-2-ol (3); the yield is 24.7 g (81%). A complete separation of the 
isomers may be effected by using a more efficient fractionating column such 
as a spinning band column; hexan-1-ol and hexan-2-ol boil at 155-156 °C and 
137-138 °C respectively at 760mmHg. Assign the 13 C-n.m.r. absorptions 
which occur at 3 14.1, 22.9, 25.9, 32.0, 32.9, and 62.6. 

Notes. (1) The apparatus should be thoroughly dried in an oven and assembled under 
a stream of dry nitrogen and allowed to cool. 

(2) Diglyme, which has b.p. 162 °C at 760mmHg, must be completely removed from 
the ether extract - otherwise it will contaminate the product. Its presence in the 
extract may be conveniently checked by g.l.c, using a 1.5-m column of 10 per cent Sili- 
cone oil on Chromosorb W held at 100 °C, with a nitrogen flow rate of 40 ml/minute, 
t R 3.2 minutes. 

(3) The g.l.c. analysis under the conditions specified in Note (2) gives hexan-2-ol and 
hexan-1-ol with t R 1.4 minutes and t R 2 minutes respectively. 

Cognate preparation. Octan-1-ol. Use 1.70 g (0.045 mol, 20% excess over the 
theoretical requirement of 0.0375 mol) of sodium borohydride, 45 ml of dry 
diglyme and a solution of 16.8 g (0.15 mol) of oct-1-ene in 25 ml of dry 



544 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNOS 5.4 



diglyme in a 250-ml three-necked round-bottomed flask (1). In the 
pressure-equalising funnel place 8.5 g (7.55 ml, 0.06 mol, 20% excess over the 
theoretical requirement of 0.05 mol) of purified boron trifluoride-etherate. 
Proceed as for hexan-1-ol; use half quantities in the alkaline oxidation step. 
After work-up, distil and collect the fraction at 191-192 °C. A product, 15.8 g 
(81%), is obtained which consists of octan-1-ol contaminated with about 7 
per cent of octan-2-ol (2). These may be separated, if required, by using a 
more efficient fractionating column. At 760mmHg octan-1-ol has b.p. 194— 
195 °C and octan-2-ol has b.p. 179 °C. 

Notes. (1) Alternatively the apparatus may be assembled with the funnel in the centre 
neck of the flask and the thermometer and condenser in the side-necks and stirred 
using a magnetic stirrer. However, the follower bar must be substantial as the reaction 
mixture becomes viscous towards the end of the experiment. 

(2) The purity of the product may be determined by g.l.c. using a 1.5-m column of 10 
per cent Silicone oil on Chromosorb W held at 128 °C with a nitrogen flow rate of 
40 ml/minute. Octan-1-ol has t R 3.3 minutes and octan-2-ol has t R 2.4 minutes.

To a stirred suspension of diisopinocampheylborane (50mmol) (1) in tetra-

stirred at 25 °C for 4.5 hours. The solid diisopinocampheylborane disappears 
and the formation of the trialkylborane is complete. The organoborane is 
treated with 4 ml of methanol, followed by 18.3 ml of 3 m sodium hydroxide 
and the careful addition of 20 ml of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide, maintain- 
ing the temperature of the reaction below 40 °C. The reaction mixture is 
further stirred at 55 °C for 1 hour, cooled, and extracted with ether 
(3 x 50 ml). The extract is washed successively with water (2 x 25 ml) and 
brine (3 ml) and dried over magnesium sulphate. The organic layer is care- 
fully fractionated to provide butan-2-ol, b.p. 96-98 °C, 2.9 g (73%), purity

Carbowax 20m on Chromosorb W is used. 

5.4.4 THE OXYMERCURATION DEMERCURATION OF ALKENES 

A mild and highly convenient procedure for the hydration of a carbon-carbon 
double bond involves the initial reaction of an alkene with mercury(n) acetate in 
aqueous tetrahydrofuran, the resulting mercurial intermediate is reduced in situ 
by alkaline sodium borohydride solution. The yields of alcohols which are 

545 



5.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



obtained with a wide variety of alkenes are usually excellent. The reaction is 
highly regioselective in that the orientation of addition to terminal and non- 
terminal alkenes proceeds via the more stable carbocation ion (Markownikoff). 
Thus in the preparation of hexan-2-ol from hex-1-ene none of the isomeric 
hexan-1-ol is detectable by g.l.c. analysis of the product. Furthermore the course 
of the reaction is tolerant to the presence of hydroxy, methoxy, acetoxy, and 
halogen substituents in the alkene. 70

Complicating side reactions may occasionally occur - as in the oxymercuration- 
demercuration of styrene to 1 -phenylethanol for which experimental details are 
also given. In this case evidently some organomercurial compounds survive the 
reductive stage, and their subsequent decomposition during final distillation 
complicates the isolation of the pure product.

Place 31.9 g (0.1 mol) of mercury(n) acetate and 100 ml of water in a 1 -litre 
three-necked flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a dropping 
funnel and a thermometer. Stir until the acetate has dissolved and then run in 
rapidly 100 ml of tetrahydrofuran; an orange-yellow suspension forms 
almost immediately. After stirring for a further 15 minutes, add 8.4 g (12.5 ml, 
0.1 mol) of hex-1-ene, whereupon the colour is rapidly discharged. Stir the 
mixture at room temperature for 1 hour to ensure completion of the oxy- 
mercuration step. Next add with vigorous stirring 100 ml of 3 m sodium 
hydroxide solution, followed by a solution of 1 .9 g (0.05 mol) of sodium boro- 
hydride in 100 ml of 3 m sodium hydroxide. Control the rate of addition of 
both solutions so that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains at 
about 25 °C, cooling the flask in cold water from time to time if necessary. 
Reduction occurs readily with the separation of elemental mercury. Finally 
stir vigorously at ambient temperature for 3 hours and then allow the reac- 
tion mixture to remain overnight in a separating funnel supported over a 
large empty conical flask. Separate the mercury layer (19.25 g, 96%) and then 
the aqueous alkaline phase, retaining the organic layer. Saturate the aqueous 
phase with sodium chloride, remove the additional organic layer which 
separates and extract the aqueous phase with two 30 ml portions of ether. 
Combine both of the organic layers with the ether extracts and remove most 
of the organic solvent carefully under reduced pressure using a rotary evapor- 
ator; stop the evaporation when two phases begin to separate. Add 50 ml of 
ether and 20 ml of water, separate the ether layer and wash it with four 25 ml 
portions of water, and dry it over anhydrous calcium sulphate. Remove the 

546 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUPIOS 5.4 



ether by flash distillation and distil the residue, collecting the hexan-2-ol at 
136-140 °C; the yield is 6.9 g (68%). 

Check the purity by g.l.c. on a 10 per cent Silicone oil column at 100 °C, 
nitrogen flow rate 40 ml per minute. The retention time is 1.42 minutes (cf. 
hexan-1-ol, 1.96 minutes). 

Cognate preparation. 1-Phenylethanol. Use 10.4g (11.5ml, 0.1 mol) of 
styrene, and carry out the oxymercuration and reduction as described above. 
The yield of recovered mercury is 17.5 g (87%), and traces continue to separ- 
ate during the work-up procedure. Distil the final crude product under 
reduced pressure and collect the 1-phenylethanol at 110-1 15 °C/25mmHg. 
Towards the end of the distillation the decomposition of residual organo- 
mercurial compounds ensues, and co-distillation of mercury contaminates 
the product; collect the contaminated fraction separately. The first fraction, 
yield 6.2 g (51%), is 92 per cent pure by g.l.c. (retention time 5.33 minutes); the 
impurity is mainly styrene (t R 2.16 minutes). The mercury-contaminated frac- 
tion (3.0 g, 25%) is 85 per cent pure by g.l.c. 

5.4.5 THE HYDROXYLATION OF ALKENES 

Hydroxylation of an alkene may be carried out using osmium tetroxide in an 
inert solvent (e.g. ether or dioxane), whereupon a cyclic osmate ester is formed. 
This undergoes hydrolytic cleavage under reducing conditions (e.g. aqueous 
sodium sulphite) to give the 1,2-diol resulting from a ds-hydroxylation pro- 



\ 



Os0 2 

or 



o 

)0s0 2 

o 



OH 
-OH 



Alternatively and more conveniently this ds-hydroxylation process can be 
effected using only catalytic amounts of osmium tetroxide together with hydro- 
gen peroxide, which cleaves the first formed osmate ester to the diol and regener- 
ates the osmium tetroxide. The reaction is carried out in t-butyl alcohol and is 
illustrated by the conversion of cyclohexene into ds-cyclohexane- 1,2-diol (Expt 
5.47). 

Other variations in this hydroxylation procedure include the use of t-butyl 
hydroperoxide 72 in place of hydrogen peroxide, and the use of PTC con- 
ditions. 73 

Alkaline potassium permanganate also effects the ds-hydroxylation of an 
alkene. A useful procedure involves the hydroxylation reagent cetyltrimethyl- 
ammonium permanganate in dichloromethane or in aqueous t-butyl alcohol. 74 
The preparation of the reagent and the two alternative general procedures are 
given in the cognate preparation to Expt 5.47. 

A 1,2-diol arising from a frans-hydroxylation process is formed from an 
alkene by way of an intermediate epoxide which is subjected to a ring-opening 
reaction and hydrolysis. The epoxides may be isolated when the alkene is 
reacted with perbenzoic acid or m-chloroperbenzoic acid (Section 4.2.56, p. 457) 
in a solvent such as chloroform or dichloromethane; the preparation of epoxides 
by this method and by other important procedures are discussed and illustrated 

547 



5.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



in Section 8.1.2, p. 1 131. With performic acid (Section 4.2.56, p. 455) isolation of 
the intermediate epoxide is not possible since it is converted by the formic acid 
solvent into the hydroxyformate ester. This product, which is formed by nucleo- 
philic ring-opening of the epoxide, is hydrolysed by treatment with dilute alkali 
to give the 1,2-diol. The formation of trans-cyclohexane- 1,2-diol (Expt 5.48) is 
illustrative of this reaction.

CAUTION: This preparation involving the toxic osmium tetroxide must be 
carried out in a fume cupboard. For the precautions to be followed when using 
30 per cent hydrogen peroxide see Section 4.2.41, p. 439. 

Prepare the reagent as follows. To a mixture of 100 ml of pure t-butyl alco- 
hol (2-methylpropan-2-ol) and 25 ml of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide, add 
anhydrous sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate in small portions; two 
layers separate out. Remove the alcohol layer which contains most of the 
hydrogen peroxide, and dry it with magnesium sulphate, followed by anhy- 
drous calcium sulphate. The resulting liquid is a stable solution of 6.3 per cent 
hydrogen peroxide in t-butyl alcohol. 

Free cyclohexene from peroxides by treating it with a saturated solution 
of sodium metabisulphite, separate, dry and distil; collect the fraction 
having b.p. 81-83 °C. Mix 8.2 g (0.1 mol) of cyclohexene with 55 ml of the 
reagent (0.1 mol), add 3 ml of a 0.5 per cent solution of osmium tetroxide 
[CAUTION: (1)] in anhydrous t-butyl alcohol and cool the mixture to 0°C. 
Allow to stand overnight, by which time the initial orange coloration will 
have disappeared. Remove the solvent and unreacted cyclohexene by distilla- 
tion at atmospheric pressure and fractionate the residue under reduced pres- 
sure using an air condenser. Collect the fraction of b.p. 120-140 °C/15 mmHg; 
this solidifies almost immediately. Recrystallise from ethyl acetate. The yield 
of pure ds-cyclohexane- 1,2-diol, m.p. 96 °C, is 5.0 g (45%). 

Note. (1) Osmium tetroxide is extremely irritating and toxic and constitutes a severe 
eye injury hazard. It may be purchased in sealed ampoules, e.g. 100 mg; the solution in 
t-butyl alcohol must be prepared and dispensed in an efficient fume cupboard, with 
the added protection of gloves and goggles. This solution is reasonably stable (e.g. the 
decomposition after one month is about 20%), provided that no 2-methylprop-l-ene 
arising from the t-butyl alcohol is present as impurity. In the latter case formation of

black colloidal osmium, which can catalyse the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, 
is rapid. 

Cognate preparations. Hydroxylation using cetyhrimethylammonium perman- 
ganate (CTAP). 74 The reagent is prepared as follows. To a stirred solution of 
potassium permanganate (3.168 g, 20mmol) in water (100ml) at 20°C is 
added dropwise over 20 minutes a solution of cetyltrimethylammonium bro- 
mide (8.02 g, 22mol) in water (100ml). A fine violet precipitate forms im- 
mediately. Stirring is continued for 30 minutes, the product isolated by 
suction, washed thoroughly with water, and dried in a desiccator over phos- 
phorus pentoxide in vacuo for 3 hours at room temperature to give a fluffy 
violet solid; yield 6.5 g (80%). The reagent is stored in a brown bottle in a 
refrigerator. 

Method A. A solution of CTAP (2.02 g, 5 mmol) in dichloromethane (30 ml) 
is added dropwise to a stirred solution of the alkene (5 mmol) in dichloro- 
methane (15 ml) at 20 °C. Stirring is continued for 1-5 hours and the mixture 
then concentrated to half its volume under reduced pressure. The residual 
solution is diluted with ether (50 ml) and filtered through a pad of Celite and 
magnesium sulphate. The filtrate is evaporated under reduced pressure and 
the remaining uic-diol purified by recrystallisation from ethyl acetate/light 
petroleum. 

Method B. A solution of CTAP (2.02 g, 5 mmol) in t-butyl alcohol (20 ml) 
and water (5 ml) is added dropwise to a stirred solution of the alkene 
(5 mmol) in t-butyl alcohol (4 ml) at 20 °C, and stirring continued for 1-5 
hours. Chloroform (50 ml) and 5 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution 
(15 ml) are added, the mixture stirred for 30 minutes and the organic layer 
separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with chloroform (3 x 50 ml). The 
combined organic extracts are dried with magnesium sulphate, filtered, and 
evaporated to leave the w'c-diol which is purified as in Method A. 

The following alkenes have been hydroxylated by these methods (method, 
stirring time, yield %): dicyclopentadiene (A, 4 hours, 86%); oct-1-ene (A, 2 
hours, 85%) (1); cyclohexene (B, 1 hour, 86%); cyclooctene (B, 1 hour, 
73%). 

Note. (1) In the case of the hydroxylation of oct-1-ene, the product was purified by 
column chromatography using ether: light petroleum 2:5 as eluate.

CAUTION: All preparations and reactions with hydrogen peroxide and

4.2.41, p. 439). Then introduce slowly 41 g (51 ml, 0.5 mol) of freshly distilled 
cyclohexene (Expt 5.12) over a period of 20-30 minutes; maintain the temper- 
ature of the reaction mixture between 40 and 45 °C by cooling with an ice 
bath and controlling the rate of addition. Keep the reaction mixture at 40 °C 
for 1 hour after all the cyclohexene has been added and then allow to stand 
overnight at room temperature. Remove most of the formic acid and water by 
distillation from a water bath under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator). 
Add an ice-cold solution of 40 g (1 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 75 ml of water 
in small portions to the residual mixture of the diol and its formate; take care 
that the temperature does not rise above 45 °C. Warm the alkaline solution to 
45 °C and add an equal volume (c. 200 ml) of ethyl acetate. Extract thor- 
oughly, separate the lower layer and extract at 45 °C six times with equal 
volumes of ethyl acetate. Combine the ethyl acetate extracts (total volume 
about 1 litre), distil off the solvent using a rotary evaporator until the residual 
volume is about 150 ml and solid commences to crystallise. Cool to 0°C and 
separate the crude product (c. 4.5 g) by suction filtration. Concentrate the 
mother-liquor to 30-40 ml, when more solid crystallises (c. 8g). Cool and 
filter the mixture as before. Distil the combined crude products under 
reduced pressure from an oil bath and using an air condenser (see Sec- 
tion 2.27); the pure frans-cyclohexane- 1,2 -diol passes over at 128— 
132°C/15mmHg (or at 120-124 °C/4mmHg) and solidifies immediately, 
m.p. 102-103 °C. The yield is 40 g (69%). It may be recrystallised from acetone 
or from ethyl acetate. 

5.4.6. SOME METHODS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE HYDROXYL GROUP 

The hydroxyl group of a primary, secondary, or tertiary acyclic or alicyclic alco- 
hol may be protected by conversion into (a) an ether, (b) a silyl ether, or (c) an 
ester. The most important method for the protection of a 1,2- or 1,3-diol is con- 
version into (d) a cyclic acetal. 

ETHERS 

When the alcohol possesses no functionality which is susceptible to basic con- 
ditions, it may be readily converted into the corresponding methyl ether by treat- 
ment with a suitable methylating agent (e.g. methyl iodide or dimethyl sulphate). 
Typical conditions are described in Expt 5.73, which also include PTC pro- 
cedures for those alcohols which are water insoluble. Polyols, as for example in 
the case of carbohydrate derivatives, may also be methylated by this PTC pro- 
cedure. If the compound to be methylated is base-labile, methylation may be 
effected by treatment of a mixture of the compound and neutral silica gel in ether 
solution with diazomethane. 75 

Methyl ethers are stable to acidic and basic conditions, and oxidising or 
reducing reagents. Deprotection to regenerate the alcohol is difficult (see Section 
9.6.10, p. 1254); a convenient mild procedure uses iodotrimethylsilane in chloro- 
form solution at room temperature. 762 The alkyl methyl ether under these con- 
ditions gives the alkyl silyl ether and methyl iodide; the former on treatment 
with methanol gives the deprotected alcohol.

An alternative reagent is trichloromethylsilane/sodium iodide in dry aceto- 
nitrile. 76b 

Benzyl ethers are readily formed under PTC conditions described in Expt 
5.73. These ethers are stable to acidic and basic media, and to oxidising reagents. 
Deprotection is effected by hydrogenolysis; the wide range of conditions appro- 
priate to the structural nature of the alcohol has been reviewed. 77 

Allyl ethers are also formed under PTC conditions (see Expt 5.73). These 
ethers are stable under moderately acidic and basic conditions. Deprotection is 
achieved by treatment with potassium t-butoxide in dimethyl sulphoxide, which 
results in rearrangement to the corresponding prop-l'-enyl ether, followed by 
reaction with a mercury(n) chloride/mercury(ii) oxide reagent mixture. 78 

R-0-CH 2 -CH=CH 2 -^* R-0-CH=CH-Me ^g&gt; ROH 

General procedure for deprotection of allyl ethers. A mixture of the allyl ether 
(0.05 mol) in dry dimethyl sulphoxide (50 ml) and potassium t-butoxide 
(0.025 mol) was heated at 100 °C, under dry nitrogen, for 15 minutes. After cool- 
ing, the mixture was diluted with water (50 ml) and extracted with dichloro- 
methane (3 x 50 ml). The organic layer was dried, evaporated and the residue 
distilled or recrystallised. The rearranged ether (0.0074 mol) and mercury(n) 
oxide (2.02 g) was dissolved in acetone: water (10:1, 67ml). To this mixture was 
added dropwise over 8-10 minutes a solution of mercury(n) chloride (2.02 g) in 
acetone:water (10:1, 22.5 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred until the reaction 
was complete (t.l.c. monitoring). The solution was diluted with ether (20 ml), fil- 
tered through a filter-bed to remove mercury compounds, and the acetone evap- 
orated. Ether was added to the residue and washed with a semi-saturated 
aqueous solution of potassium iodide (3 x 10 ml), dried and evaporated. The 
regenerated alcohol was purified by distillation or recrystallisation as appro- 
priate. 

An alternative deprotection method, which proceeds without prior iso- 
merisation, involves heating under reflux the allyl ether in aqueous methanol 
with palladium/activated charcoal in the presence of toluene-p-sulphonic acid. 79 

2-Methoxyethoxymethyl ethers, MEM-ethers, are formed by reaction of an 
alcohol (1 mol) with 2-methoxyethoxymethyl chloride (1.5 mol, MEM-chloride) 
in dichloromethane solution (10 ml/g of MEM-chloride) at room temperature in 
the presence of ethyldiisopropylamine (1.5 mol) 80 ; this literature report also 
notes other preparative procedures. 

ROH + ClCH 2 -OCH 2 -CH 2 -OMe &gt; ROCH 2 -OCH 2 -CH 2 -OMe 

These ethers are stable to reducing and oxidising agents, to organometallic 
reagents, and to mildly acidic conditions that deprotect tetrahydropyranyl and 
silyl ethers (see below). They are deprotected by the action of either anhydrous 
zinc bromide or titanium(iv) chloride in dichloromethane solution. 80 

Tetrahydropyranyl ethers, THP-ethers, are formed by reaction of an alcohol 
with 2,3-dihydropyran in the presence of an acid catalyst. The procedures below 
illustrate the use of concentrated hydrochloric acid or pyridinium toluene-p- 
sulphonate. Amberlyst H-15 resin has also been used as a reaction catalyst. 81

5.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Procedures for THP-ether formation. Use of hydrochloric acid. Concentrated 
hydrochloric acid (0.3 ml) was added to a mixture of 2,3-dihydropyran 
(0.75 mol) and the alcohol (0.5 mol). Reaction commenced immediately on shak- 
ing and was moderated by cooling in an ice-water bath. The mixture was shaken 
for a further 30 minutes, allowed to stand overnight, diluted with ether (150 ml), 
and the solution washed twice with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solu- 
tion. The ethereal solution was dried and evaporated, and the residue distilled 
under reduced pressure. 

Use of pyridinium toluene-p-sulphonate (PPTS). 82 A solution of geraniol 
(154 mg, l.Ommol) and dihydropyran (126 mg, l.Ommol) in dry dichloro- 
methane (7 ml) containing PPTS (25 mg, 0.1 mmol) (1) was stirred for 4 hours at 
room temperature. Then the solution was diluted with ether and washed once 
with half-saturated brine to remove the catalyst. The ethereal solution was dried, 
evaporated and distilled [b.p. 140 °C (bath temperature)/10mmHg] to give an 
essentially quantitative yield of geraniol THP-ether (236 mg, 99%). 

Note. (1) Pyridinium toluene-p-sulphonate was prepared as follows. 82 Toluene-p- 
sulphonic acid monohydrate (5.70 g, 30 mmol) was added to pyridine (12.1 ml, 150mol) 
with stirring at room temperature (slightly exothermic). After stirring for 20 minutes the 
excess of pyridine was removed with a rotary evaporator on a water bath at c. 60 °C to 
afford a quantitative yield of PPTS as slightly hygroscopic colourless crystals. Recrystal- 
lisation from acetone gave the pure salt (6.8 g, 90%), m.p. 120 °C. 

Tetrahydropyranyl ethers are stable to strong bases, to Grignard reagents 
and alkyllithiums, and to acylating and alkylating reagents. It has been reported 
that explosions have occurred during distillations of THP-ethers after a reaction 
involving borane-hydrogen peroxide-sodium hydroxide or epoxidation reagents.** 
It is suggested that similar hazards might be experienced with similar protecting 
groups (e.g. 1 ,3-dioxolanes). Two frequently used methods of deprotection are as 
follows. 

Procedures for deprotection of THP-ethers. Use ofmethanolic hydrochloric acid. 

The THP-ether (0.2 mol) was dissolved in methanol (200ml) and concentrated 
hydrochloric acid (30 ml), and the mixture heated under reflux for 2 hours. After 
cooling, the solution was neutralised by the addition of an excess of sodium 
hydrogen carbonate, diluted with ether (200 ml), filtered and the ether evapor- 
ated. The residue was dissolved in ether, washed twice with water, dried and 
evaporated. The deprotected alcohol was distilled under reduced pressure. 

Use of an ethanolic solution of PPTS. 82 A solution of geraniol THP-ether 
( 1 1 9 mg, 0.5 mmol) and PPTS ( 1 2.6 mg, 0.05 mol) in ethanol (4 ml) was stirred at 
55 °C (bath temperature) for 3 hours. The solvent was removed and the residue 
chromatographed on a column of silica gel to afford pure geraniol (77 mg, 
100%). 

SILYL ETHERS 

There are many silylating reagents for the conversion of an alcohol into the cor- 
responding silyl ether. The reader should consult the Handbook of the Pierce 
Chemical Co. for an authoritative survey. The procedure for the formation of 
trimethylsilyl ethers of carbohydrate derivatives with hexamethyldisilazane/ 
chlorotrimethylsilyl chloride in pyridine and the subsequent examination by 
g.l.c. analysis is described in Section 2.31.

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.5 



ROH + (Me 3 Si) 2 NH/Me 3 SiCl ^^ R-OSiMe 3 

Trimethylsilyl ethers are readily hydrolysed under acidic or basic conditions, e.g. 
with methanolic citric acid, or with potassium carbonate in dry methanol. 

The t-butyldimethylsilyl ether (TMBS-ether), formed from the alcohol with 
t-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of imidazole in dimethylformamide 
solution, 843 is more stable to hydrolysis than the TMS-ether (see also Section 
4.2.66, p. 461). Deprotection is readily effected by treatment with 2-3 equivalents 
of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran at 25 °C, 84a or tetrabutyl- 
ammonium chloride and potassium fluoride dihydrate in acetonitrile. 84b 

ESTERS 

The alcoholic hydroxyl group may be protected by conversion into, for example, 
the acetate, benzoate, p-nitrobenzoate, or toluene-p-sulphonate esters. Suitable 
specific and general procedures are described in Expts 5.142, 6.46, 6.163 and in 
Section 9.6.4, p. 1241. Esters may be hydrolysed under basic or acidic conditions, 
suitable procedures are described in Section 9.6.17, p. 1266. 

CYCLIC ACETALS 

The reaction of a 1,2- or a 1,3-diol with an aldehyde or ketone under anhydrous 
conditions gives rise to a cyclic acetal. A discussion of this reaction is given in 
Section 5.10.3, p. 652, where some structural features for acetal formation and 
selectivity of removal are reviewed. Other instances of the value of this protec- 
tive group are to be found in Expts 5.9 and 5.63 and in Section 5.8.8, p. 623. It 
should be pointed out that cyclic acetal formation is also an important pro- 
cedure for the protection of the carbonyl group. 

5.5 ALIPHATIC HALIDES 

The halogen in a saturated alkyl halide may be located on a primary carbon 
atom (R-CH 2 X), a secondary carbon atom (R 2 CHX), or a tertiary carbon atom 
(R 3 CX). The halogen-carrying carbon atom (the a-carbon) in a secondary or a 
tertiary halide may be a chiral site (*) as shown below in the case of 
(R)-2-chlorobutane (1) CH 3 -CH 2 -CHC1-CH 3 . Compounds where the halogen 
is attached to an sp 2 -hybridised carbon atom of an alkene are termed alkenyl 
(or vinyl) halides [R-CH=CHX, e.g. (£)-l-chlorobut-l-ene (2) 
CH 3 -CH 2 -CH=CHC1]. In those cases where the halogen is attached to an sp- 
hybridised carbon atom in an alkyne, the compounds are called alkynyl (or 
acetylenic) halides [R-G=C-X, e.g. 1-bromobut-l-yne (3) CH 3 -CH 2 -C=CBr]. 
Allylic halides (R-CH=CH-CH 2 X) have an sp 2 -hybridised carbon atom 
attached to a saturated halogen-carrying carbon [e.g. (£)-l-iodobut-2-ene (4) 
CH 3 -CH=CH-CH 2 I].

2. Displacement reactions involving (a) a halogen atom (Expts 5.61 and 5.62), 
(b) a methanesulphonyloxy group (Expt 5.63), and (c) an amino group. 

3. The addition of hydrogen halides or halogens to alkenes (Expts 5.64 to 5.67). 

4. The replacement of reactive allylic hydrogen atoms by bromine (Expts 5.68 
and 5.69).

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The i.r. spectrum of an alkyl halide shows the expected absorptions due to the 
vibrations of the carbon-hydrogen skeletal structure, together with strong 
absorption in the region below 700 cm ~ ' due to the stretching of the carbon- 
halogen bond. Medium intensity absorptions for C — F bonds are found in the 
region 1 1 50 to 1 300 cm ~ ' (p. 3 1 6). The structure of the alkyl group may often be 
established from the p.m.r. spectrum owing to the deshielding effect of the halo- 
gen (p. 324) which frequently leads to first order splitting patterns being 
obtained (p. 341). The rather weak intensity of the molecular ion in the m.s. of 
alkyl halides makes the recognition of the isotope ratios of chloro- and bromo 
compounds more difficult than in the case of aryl halides (p. 382); the most in- 
tense fragment ions usually arise from loss of halogen or hydrogen halide from 
the molecular ion. The alkyl halides do not absorb in the accessible u.v.-visible 
region. Some of the preparations below provide illustrative descriptive struc- 
tural interpretations based on these spectroscopic features.

5.51 PREPARATION OF ALKYL CHLORIDES FROM ALCOHOLS 

The hydroxyl group in tertiary alcohols is most readily replaced, and this is 
effected by simply allowing the alcohol to react with concentrated hydrochloric 
acid at room temperature. The reaction is a nucleophilic displacement of the S N 1 
type involving the formation of a relatively stable carbocation intermediate.

R,COH =?=± R,COH 2 ^==± R,C® ^U R,CC1 

The reaction is illustrated by the preparation of t-butyl chloride (Expt 5.49). 

Secondary, and to a greater extent primary, alcohols require more vigorous 
conditions to effect the substitution reaction, which is usually achieved by heat- 
ing the alcohol-acid mixture with anhydrous zinc chloride. Illustrative examples 
are given in Expt 5.50. In the case of alicyclic secondary alcohols anhydrous cal- 
cium chloride is recommended (e.g. the preparation of chlorocyclohexane, Expt 
5.51). The unsaturated alcohol, allyl alcohol, gives a poor yield by the HC1- 
ZnCl 2 method, but an alternative procedure using copper(i) chloride as catalyst 
has proved to be more satisfactory (Expt 5.51, cognate preparation). 

The hydrochloric acid-zinc chloride reaction may be an S N 2 type displace- 
ment, particularly in the case of primary alcohols.

hols.

The regioselectivity of this latter reaction pathway may be diminished owing to 
the tendency of carbocations to rearrange, particularly when branching of the 
carbon chain occurs in the /^-position. Hence the method is preparatively useful 
only with secondary alcohols (e.g. butan-2-ol) where one unique secondary 
carbocation is involved (see also Section 5.5.2, p. 560). 

Rearrangement may be largely (but not entirely) suppressed by preparing the 
alkyl chloride from a reaction of the alcohol with thionyl chloride, either (i) 
alone, or (ii) in the presence of catalytic or equimolar proportions of pyridine, or 
(iii) in the presence of dimethylformamide. 85 " In (i) a chlorosulphite is first 
formed which decomposes via two sequentially formed ion-pair species; the 
second ion pair collapses to yield the alkyl chloride.

In (iii) the interaction of thionyl chloride with dimethylformamide gives a 
chloroimine chlorosulphite (cf. p. 992), which then reacts with the alcohol to 
form an alkoxyimine; a subsequent S N 2 displacement with the chloride ion 
yields dimethylformamide and the alkyl chloride. This reaction has been studied 
in considerable detail 853 and a g.l.c. procedure has been described to analyse the 
mixture of regiosomers. 85b All these reaction procedures are described in Expt 
5.52.

Finally triphenylphosphine with carbon tetrachloride (or carbon tetra-

In a 250-ml separatory funnel place 25 g (0.34 mol) of 2-methylpropan-2-ol 
(t-butyl alcohol, b.p. 82-83 °C, m.p. 25 °C) and 85 ml of concentrated hydro-

After each shaking, loosen the stopper to relieve any internal pressure. Allow 
the mixture to stand for a few minutes until the layers have separated sharply; 
draw off and discard the lower acid layer. Wash the halide with 20 ml of 5 per 
cent sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and then with 20 ml of water. Dry 
the preparation with 5 g of anhydrous calcium chloride or anhydrous calcium 
sulphate. Decant the dried liquid through a funnel supporting a fluted filter 
paper into a 100-ml distilling flask, add 2-3 chips of porous porcelain and 
distil. Collect the fraction boiling at 49-51 °C. The yield of t-butyl chloride is 
28 g (90%). The p.m.r. spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) shows a signal at 5 1.67 (s, 9H, 
Me 3 C— ). 

Note. (1) The addition of 10 g of anhydrous calcium chloride tends to concentrate the

TMS) shows signals at (50.95 (t, 3H, Me), 1.10-2.00 (m, 4H, — CH 2 -CH 2 — ) 
and 3.49 (t, 2H, — CH 2 C1). The base peak in the m.s. appears at m/z 56 
(M - HC1). 

Note. (1) The sulphuric acid treatment removes high-boiling impurities which are not 
easily separated by distillation. 

Cognate preparations. The following alkyl chlorides may be prepared in sim- 
ilar yield by replacing the butan-1-ol in the above preparation by the appro- 
priate quantity of the requisite alcohol: 1 -chloropentane, b.p. 104-107 °C, 
from 22 g of pentan-1-ol; l-chloro-3-methylbutane, b.p. 98-100 °C, from 22 g 
of 3-methylbutan-l-ol (isopentyl alcohol); 2-chlorobutane, b.p. 67-69 °C, from 
18.5 g of butan-2-ol.

^V" + HC1 ^&gt; (~\( + H 2 

In a 1 -litre, round-bottomed two-necked flask, carrying a reflux condenser 
and mechanical stirrer, place lOOg (1 mol) of pure cyclohexanol, 250ml of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 80 g of anhydrous calcium chloride: heat 
the mixture on a boiling water bath for 10 hours with stirring (1). Some 
hydrogen chloride is evolved, consequently the preparation should be con- 
ducted in the fume cupboard. Separate the upper layer from the cold reaction 
product, wash it successively with saturated salt solution, saturated sodium 
hydrogen carbonate solution, saturated salt solution, and leave the crude 
chlorocyclohexane over an excess of anhydrous calcium chloride for at least 
24 hours. Distil from a 150-ml flask through a fractionating side-arm, and 
collect the pure product at 141.5-142.5 °C. The yield is 90 g (76%). 

Note. (1) The refluxing period may be reduced to 6 hours and the yield improved 
slightly by mechanical stirring; a three-necked flask should be used. 

An alternative method of conducting the preparation consists in treating 100 g of

cyclohexanol with 250 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, refluxing slowly while a 
stream of hydrogen chloride gas is passed into the mechanically stirred mixture for 3 
hours. (The apparatus required is similar to that described for a Clemmensen reduc- 
tion in Expt 5.5.) Chlorocyclohexane, b.p. 141-143 °C, is isolated as above; the yield is 80 g. 

Cognate preparations. Chlorocyclopentane (cyclopentyl chloride). Use 43 g 
(0.5 mol) of cyclopentanol (Expt 5.29), 125 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid and 50 g of anhydrous calcium chloride. The yield of chlorocyclo- 
pentane, b.p. 113-1 15 °C, is 30 g (57%). 

Ally I chloride. Place 87g (100ml, 1.5 mol) of allyl alcohol, 150 ml of concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid and 2g of freshly prepared copper(i) chloride 
(Section 4.2.22, p. 428) in a 750-ml round-bottomed flask equipped with a 
reflux condenser. Cool the flask in ice and add 50 ml of concentrated sul- 
phuric acid dropwise through the condenser with frequent shaking of the 
flask. A little hydrogen chloride may be evolved towards the end of the reac- 
tion. Allow the turbid liquid to stand for 30 minutes in order to complete the 
separation of the allyl chloride. Remove the upper layer, wash it with twice its 
volume of water, and dry over anhydrous calcium chloride. Distil and collect 
the allyl chloride which passes over at 46-47 °C; the yield is about lOOg 
(87%). Interpret the following data from the m.s.; m/z 78 (RA 9.3%), 76 (RA 
27.8%), 41 (RA 100%), 40 (RA 11.7%) and 39 (RA 72.5%).

Reaction in the absence of catalyst. Assemble in a fume cupboard a 500-ml 
three-necked flask equipped with a sealed stirrer unit, a double surface reflux 
condenser and a separatory funnel; fit the condenser and the funnel with cal- 
cium chloride guard-tubes. Place 179 g (109.5 ml, 1.5 mol) of redistilled 
thionyl chloride in the flask and 51 g (62.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of hexan-1-ol, b.p. 
156-158 °C, in the separatory funnel. Add the alcohol with stirring during 2 
hours; there is a slight evolution of heat, sulphur dioxide is evolved and the 
liquid darkens considerably. When all the alcohol has been added, reflux the 
mixture for 2 hours. Rearrange the apparatus for distillation, and distil 
slowly; the excess of thionyl chloride passes over below 80 °C, followed by a 
small fraction up to 120 °C; and finally the crude 1-chlorohexane at 132— 
134 °C. Wash the last-named successively with water, 10 per cent sodium car- 
bonate solution, and twice with water. Dry with anhydrous calcium chloride 
and distil through a short fractionating column. Pure 1-chlorohexane passes 
over at 133-1 34 °C. The yield is 36 g (60%). 

Cognate preparations. 1-Chloroheptane. From 58 g (70.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of 
heptan-1-ol (b.p. 175-177°C) and 179g (109.5ml, 1.5 mol) of redistilled 
thionyl chloride; refluxing period, 4 hours. The yield of 1-chloroheptane, b.p. 
159-1 60 °C, is 52g(77%). 

1-Chlorododecane. From 46.5 g (0.25 mol) of dodecan-1-ol (lauryl alcohol), 
m.p. 24 °C, and 1 19 g (73 ml, 1 mol) of redistilled thionyl chloride; refluxing 
period, 6 hours. The crude chloride passes over at 252-257 °C, mainly at 255- 
257 °C. Upon redistillation under reduced pressure 35 g (68%) of 1-chloro- 
dodecane, b.p. 116.5°C/5mmHg, are obtained.

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.5 



1,4-Dichlorobutane. Place 22.5 g (0.25 mol) of redistilled butane- 1,4-diol and 
3 ml of dry pyridine in the flask in an ice bath. Add 119 g (73 ml, 1 mol) of 
redistilled thionyl chloride dropwise to the vigorously stirred mixture at such 
a rate that the temperature remains at 5-10 °C. When the addition is com- 
plete, remove the ice bath, keep the mixture overnight and then reflux for 3 
hours. Cool, add ice-water cautiously and extract with ether. Wash the 
ethereal extract successively with 10 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate 
solution and water, and dry with magnesium sulphate. Remove the ether by 
flash distillation and distil the residue under reduced pressure. Collect the 1,4- 
dichlorobutane at 55.5-56.5 °C/14mmHg; the yield is 18 g (58%). The b.p. 
under atmospheric pressure is 154-155 °C. 

Isobutyl chloride (l-chloro-2-methylpropane). Reaction in the presence of pyri- 
dine. Place 37 g (46ml, 0.5 mol) of 2-methylpropan-l-ol (b.p. 106-108 °C) 
and 40 g (41 ml, 0.5 mol) of pure pyridine (CAUTION) in the flask, and 1 1 9 g 
(73 ml, 1.0 mol) of redistilled thionyl chloride in the funnel. Introduce the 
thionyl chloride with stirring during 3-4 hours; a white solid separates, which 
partially dissolves as the reaction proceeds. Reflux for 45 minutes: the solid 
will dissolve completely. Allow to cool and remove the upper layer. Wash the 
latter cautiously with water, 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and twice 
with water; dry with anhydrous calcium chloride. Distil the product through 
a short fractionating column and collect the isobutyl chloride at 68-69 °C. 
The yield is 26 g (56%). Record the p.m.r. spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) and assign 
the signals which appear at 8 1.03 (d, 6H), 1.91 (m, 1H) and 3.32 (d, 2H). The 
base peak in the m.s. appears at m/z 43 [M — ( — CH 2 35,37 C1) and corres- 
ponds to the isopropyl carbocation. 

General procedure for reactions in the presence of dimethylformamide. 85 Thio- 
nyl chloride (1.1 mol) followed by the alcohol (1 mol) is added dropwise to 
dimethylformamide (40 ml) at 0-10 °C (1). The reaction is heated as specified 
below, cooled and excess water added. The upper layer is then washed, dried 
(K 2 C0 3 ) and distilled. The following conditions are specified: neopentyl 
alcohol (150 °C, 2 hours), pentan-3-ol (100 °C, 0.5 hours), 3-methylbutan-2-ol 
(100 °C, 0.5 hours). 

Note. (1) The dimethylformamide is dried over molecular sieves. 

5.5.2 PREPARATION OF ALKYL BROMIDES FROM ALCOHOLS 

The formation of alkyl bromides is more ready than that of the alkyl chlorides. 
Hence secondary as well as tertiary bromides can be obtained directly from the 
corresponding alcohols by heating with constant boiling hydrobromic acid (e.g. 
Expt 5.53), although in the case of primary alcohols the presence of sulphuric 
acid results, as a rule, in a more rapid reaction and in improved yields. 

ROH + HBr &gt; RBr + H 2 

The method is readily adapted for the preparation of dibromides from diols. 
Typical examples are provided in Expt 5.54. The cyclic ethers tetrahydrofuran 
and tetrahydropyran are readily cleaved by the hydrobromic acid-sulphuric 
acid medium, and this provides an alternative and convenient preparation of the 
corresponding a, co-dihalides.

As with the corresponding formation of akyl chlorides however, the pro- 
cedure is only preparatively satisfactory with primary alcohols which react by a 
predominantly S N 2 mechanism, or with secondary and tertiary alcohols (S N 1 
mechanism) where carbocation rearrangements do not give rise to isomeric 
products. Some appreciation of the difficulty of attaining high regioselectivity, 
may be gained from the observation that both pentan-2-ol and pentan-3-ol give 
the same mixture of carbocations in the presence of hydrobromic acid, and yield 
2-bromo- and 3-bromo-pentane in a 70:30 ratio as determined by a g.l.c. 
analysis procedure. 87

Promotion of an S N 2 displacement mechanism, and hence greater regioselect- 
ivity, may be effected by the addition of liquid bromine to a warm suspension of 
purified red phosphorus in the appropriate alcohol. The reaction is of general 
application: with primary alcohols (isobutyl alcohol to hexadecan-1-ol) the 
yields are over 90 per cent of the theoretical, but with secondary alcohols the 
yields are in the range 50-80 per cent (Expt 5.55). This method is to be preferred 
to the direct use (rather than the in situ generation) of phosphorus tribromide 
which is the more hazardous reagent. The outline mechanism may be repre- 
sented thus:

Experiment 5.53 ISOPROPYL BROMIDE (2-Bromopropane) 

Me-CH(OH)-Me + HBr &gt; Me-CHBr-Me + H 2 

Mix 40 g (51ml, 0.67 mol) of propan-2-ol (isopropyl alcohol) with 460 g 
(310 ml) of constant boiling-point hydrobromic acid in a 500-ml flask fitted 
with a double surface condenser, add a few boiling chips and distil slowly (1-2 
drops per second) until about half of the liquid has passed over. Separate the 
lower alkyl bromide layer (70 g), and redistil the aqueous layer when a further 
7g of the crude bromide will be obtained (1). Shake the crude bromide in a 
separatory funnel successively with an equal volume of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid (2), water, 5 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 
water, and dry with anhydrous calcium chloride. Distil from a 100-ml flask; 
the isopropyl bromide passes over at 59 °C. The yield is 66 g (81%). The p.m.r. 
spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) shows signals at 3 1.70 (d, 6H, Me 2 CH— ) and 4.21 
(sept, 1H, — CH— ). 

Notes. (1) The residue in the flask may be mixed with the aqueous layer of the first 
distillate, 40 g of propan-2-ol added, and the slow distillation repeated. The yield of 
crude isopropyl bromide in the second distillation is only slightly less than that 
obtained in the original preparation. Subsequently most of the residual hydrobromic 
acid may be recovered by distillation as the constant boiling point acid (126 °C). 
(2) The hydrochloric acid washing removes any unchanged alcohol which may be 
present. 

Cognate preparations. Bromocyclohexane. Use 50 g (0.5 mol) of cyclohexanol 
and 260 g (176 ml) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and distil all the mixture 
slowly (6 hours). Add a little water to the distillate, separate the lower layer of 
crude bromide, and purify as above. Collect the bromocyclohexane at 163— 
165°C(60g,74%). 

Bromocyclopentane. Use 43 g (0.5 mol) of cyclopentanol (Expt 5.29) and 
260 g (176 ml) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid. Collect the bromocyclo- 
pentane at 135-137 °C (55 g, 74%).

Me-(CH 2 ) 2 -CH 2 OH + HBr " :S ° 4 &gt; Me-(CH 2 ) 2 -CH 2 Br + H,0 

To 250 g of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid contained in a 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask add 75 g (41 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in portions 
with shaking; some hydrogen bromide may be evolved. Add 88 g (110 ml, 
1.2 mol) of butan-1-ol, followed by 60 g (32.5 ml) of concentrated sulphuric 
acid in several portions with shaking, and finally a few chips of porous por- 
celain. Attach a reflux condenser to the flask and reflux the mixture gently on 
a wire gauze for 2-3 hours; during this period the formation of butyl bromide 
is almost complete and a layer separates above the acid (1). If the preparation 
is carried out in the open laboratory, fit an absorption device (Fig. 2.61(a) or 
(b)) to the top of the condenser in order to absorb any hydrogen bromide and 
sulphur dioxide which may be evolved. Allow the contents of the flask to cool, 
remove the condenser and set it for downward distillation. Distil the mixture 
until no more oily drops of butyl bromide pass over (30-40 minutes). 
Transfer the distillate to a separatory funnel and remove the halide which 

561 



5.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



forms the lower layer. Wash it successively with water, an equal volume of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid (2), water, 5 per cent sodium hydrogen car- 
bonate or sodium carbonate solution, and water. Separate the water as com- 
pletely as possible and dry with 2-3 g of anhydrous calcium chloride or 
magnesium sulphate; the desiccant should be left in contact with the bromide 
for at least 30 minutes and shaken occasionally. Filter the dried product 
through a small funnel supporting a fluted filter paper into a 200-ml flask, 
add a few chips of porous porcelain and distil either from an air bath (Fig. 
2.46) or on a ceramic-centred wire gauze. Collect the portion boiling at 100- 
103 °C. The yield is 155g (95%). 

Notes. (1) A suitable hydrogen bromide medium can be prepared by dissolving 240 g 
of potassium bromide in 400 ml of warm water, cooling and adding 200 ml of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid slowly and with constant stirring, so that the temperature does 
not rise above 40 °C. After further cooling to 15°C, the mixture is filtered and the 
butan-1-ol is added to the filtrate. A further 120 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid is 
then added carefully and the mixture is heated under reflux for 3-4 hours. 
(2) The crude bromide contains a little unchanged alcohol and is said to contain some 
dibutyl ether (b.p. 141 °C). The former is removed by washing with concentrated 
hydrochloric acid and this purification process is satisfactory for most purposes. Both 
the alcohol and the ether are removed by washing with 1 1-12 ml of concentrated sul- 
phuric acid; the butyl bromide is not affected by this reagent. 

Cognate preparations, s-Butyl bromide (2-bromobutane). The quantities 
required are as for butyl bromide but with butan-2-ol (b.p. 99-100 °C) re- 
placing the butan-1-ol. Two to three washings with concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid are necessary, i.e. until the volume of the acid layer remains 
unchanged on shaking with halide. The yield of s-butyl bromide, b.p. 90.5- 
92.5°C,isl50g(92%). 

1-Bromopentane (pentyl bromide). Use 210 g (142 ml) of 48 per cent hydro- 
bromic acid, 60 g (33 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid, followed by 88 g 
(108ml, lmol) pentan-1-ol (b.p. 135-136 °C) and lOg (5.5ml) of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid. Distil the product through a short fractionating col- 
umn, and collect the 1-bromopentane at 127-130 °C (135 g, 89%). 

l-Bromo-3-methylbutane. Proceed as for 1-bromopentane, but use 88 g 
(109ml, lmol) of 3-methylbutan-l-ol, b.p. 129.5-131 °C. Distil the purified 
product through a fractionating column and collect the l-bromo-3- 
methylbutane at 1 17-120 °C (125 g, 83%). 

Allyl bromide. Introduce into a 1 -litre three-necked flask 250 g (169 ml) of 48 
per cent hydrobromic acid and then 75 g (40.5 ml) of concentrated sulphuric 
acid in portions, with shaking; finally add 58 g (68 ml, 1 mol) of pure allyl 
alcohol. Fit the flask with a separatory funnel, a mechanical stirrer and an 
efficient condenser (preferably of the double surface type) set for downward 
distillation. Place 75 g (40.5 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in the separ- 
atory funnel, set the stirrer in motion and allow the acid to flow slowly into 
the warm solution. The allyl bromide will distil over (&lt;30 minutes). Wash 
the distillate with 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution, followed by water, 
dry over anhydrous calcium chloride, and distil from a flask through a short 
fractionating column. The yield of allyl bromide, b.p. 69-72 °C, is 1 1 2 g (93%). 
There is a small high-boiling fraction containing 1,2-dibromopropane. 



562 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.5 



1,3-Dibromopropane (trimethylene dibromide). In a 1 -litre round-bottomed 
flask place 500 g (338 ml) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and add 150 g 
(82 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in portions, with shaking. Then add 
91 g of propane-l,3-diol (b.p. 210-215 °C), followed by 240g (130.5ml) of 
concentrated sulphuric acid slowly and with shaking. Attach a reflux con- 
denser to the flask and reflux the mixture for 3-4 hours. Arrange for down- 
ward distillation and distil, using a wire gauze, until no more oily drops pass 
over (30-40 minutes). Purify the 1,3-dibromopropane as detailed for butyl 
bromide above. About 220 g (91%) of the pure dibromide, b.p. 162-165 °C, are 
obtained. 

1,4-Dibromobutane (from butane- 1 ,4-diol). In a 500-ml three-necked flask 
fitted with a stirrer, reflux condenser and dropping funnel, place 154g 
(105 ml) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid. Cool the flask in an ice bath. Add 
slowly, with stirring, 130g (71ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid. To the 
resulting ice-cold solution add 30g (0.33 mol) of redistilled butane- 1,4-diol 
dropwise. Leave the reaction mixture to stand for 24 hours; heat for 3 hours 
on a steam bath. The reaction mixture separates into two layers. Separate the 
lower layer, wash it successively with water, 10 per cent sodium carbonate 
solution and water, and then dry with magnesium sulphate. Distil and collect 
the 1,4-dibromobutane at 83-84 °C/12mmHg. The yield is 55 g (76%). 

1,4-Dibromobutane (from tetrahydrofuran). Place a mixture of 250 g (170 ml) 
of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and 75 g (41 ml) of concentrated sulphuric 
acid in a 500-ml round -bottomed flask, add 18.1 g (20.5 ml, 0.25 mol) of re- 
distilled tetrahydrofuran (Section 4.1.79, p. 406) (b.p. 65-66 °C), attach a 
reflux condenser and reflux gently for 3 hours. Separate the lower layer of 
dibromide and purify as in the previous preparation. The yield of 1,4- 
dibromobutane, b.p. 83-84°C/12mmHg is 40 g (74%). 

1 ,5-Dibromopentane (from pentane-1 ,5-diol). Proceed as for 1,4-dibromo- 
butane but use 35 g (0.33 mol) of redistilled commercial pentane-l,5-diol. The 
yield of 1,5-dibromopentane, b.p. 99°C/13mmHg, is 39 g (51%). 

1 ,5-Dibromopentane (from tetrahydropyran). Proceed as for 1,4-dibromo- 
butane (from tetrahydrofuran) but use 21.5 g (24.4 ml, 0.25 mol) of redistilled 
tetrahydropyran (b.p. 86.5-87.5 °C). The yield of 1,5-dibromopentane, b.p. 
99°C/13mmHg, is 46 g (80%).

Place 92.5g (115ml, 1.25 mol) of isobutyl alcohol (2-methylpropan-l-ol) and 
8.55 g (0.275 mol) of purified red phosphorus (Section 4.2.59, p. 458) in a 500- 
ml three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux con- 
denser and a dropping funnel containing 100 g (32 ml, 0.62 mol) of bromine 
(for precautions in the use of bromine, see Section 4.2.9, p. 422). Start the 
stirrer, heat the flask (e.g., in an oil bath) so that the contents reflux gently, 
and introduce the bromine at such a rate that it appears to react completely 
so that there is little bromine vapour above the surface of the reaction mix-

ture, and the reaction is under control. When all the bromine has been added, 
reflux the mixture gently for 1 5-30 minutes more. Remove the stirrer, arrange 
the condenser for downward distillation and distil off most of the isobutyl 
bromide (1). Then add about 50 ml of water through the dropping funnel and 
continue the distillation to remove the remainder of the product. Separate the 
crude bromide and wash it successively with water, an approximately equal 
volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid, water, 10 per cent sodium carbon- 
ate solution, and finally water. Dry the product over anhydrous calcium 
chloride and distil, collecting the isobutyl bromide which passes over at 91- 
94 °C. The yield is 150 g (91%). 

Note. (1) It is not advisable to distil the mixture almost to dryness since the formation 
of flammable alkene may then occur. This is avoided by conducting the distillation in 
two stages as described.

with vigorous stirring and add the bromine slowly. Allow the mixture to cool 
after all the bromine has been introduced. Add ether, filter off the excess of 
phosphorus and wash the ethereal solution of the bromide with water and 
dry over anhydrous potassium carbonate. Remove the ether on a water bath,

bromine and proceed as under 1-bromododecane; b.p. 178.5-179.5 °C/ 
20mmHg, m.p. 5°C. 

1-Bromohexadecane. Use 121 g (0.5 mol) of hexadecan-1-ol (cetyl alcohol), 
m.p. 48 °C, 3.41 g (0.1 1 mol) of purified red phosphorus and 44 g (0.275 mol) 
of bromine, and proceed as for 1-bromododecane; filter off the excess of phos- 
phorus at 16-20°C; b.p. 202-203 "C/21 mmHg; m.p. 14 °C. 

I-Bromo-2-phenylethane. Use 1 52.5 g (148 ml, 1.25 mol) of 2-phenylethanol 
(Expt 5.37), b.p. 216.5-217 °C, 10.35 g (0.33 mol) of purified red phosphorus 
and 1 10 g (35.5 ml, 0.68 mol) of bromine. Isolate the l-bromo-2-phenylethane 
as detailed for 1-bromododecane; b.p. 98°C/12mmHg. 

* Unless otherwise stated, the yields exceed 90 per cent of the theoretical. 
t The slight excess of bromine over the theoretical equivalent to the alcohol in the preparation of 
high boiling point bromides ensures the absence of unchanged alcohol in the product; any excess 
of bromine may be removed by the addition of a little sodium metabisulphite.

1,4-Dibromobutane (from butane-1 ,4-diol). Use 45 g (0.5 mol) of redistilled 
butane- 1,4-diol, 6.84 g (0.22 mol) of purified red phosphorus and 80 g (26 ml, 
0.5 mol) of bromine. Heat the glycol-phosphorus mixture to 100-1 50 °C and 
add the bromine slowly; continue heating at 100-150 °C for 1 hour after all 
the bromine has been introduced. Allow to cool, dilute with water, add 100 ml 
of ether and remove the excess of red phosphorus by filtration. Separate the 
ethereal solution of the dibromide, wash it successively with 10 per cent 
sodium thiosulphate solution and water, then dry over the anhydrous potas- 
sium carbonate. Remove the ether on a water bath and distil the residue 
under diminished pressure. Collect the 1,4-dibromobutane at 83-84 °C/ 
12mmHg; the yield is 73 g (67%). 

1,6-Dibromohexane. Proceed as for 1,4-dibromobutane but use 58 g 
(0.49 mol) of hexane-l,6-diol. The yield of 1,6-dibromohexane, b.p. 114- 
115 °C/12 mmHg, is 85 g (71%). 

1,4-Dibromobutane (from tetrahydrofuran). Place 18.1 g (20.5 ml, 0.25 mol) of 
redistilled tetrahydrofuran (b.p. 65-66 °C), 3.41 g (0.11 mol) of purified red 
phosphorus and 4.5 g of water in the flask. Heat the mixture gently and add 
40g (13 ml, 0.25 mol) of bromine at such a rate that there is little bromine 
vapour above the surface of the reaction mixture. Heat at 100-150 °C for 45- 
60 minutes after all the bromine has been introduced. Work up as for the 
butane- 1,4-diol preparation. The yield of 1,4-dibromobutane, b.p. 83-84 °C/ 
12 mmHg, is 42 g (72%). 

1,5-Dibromopentane (from tetrahydropyran). Proceed as in the previous pre- 
paration but replace the tetrahydrofuran by 21.5 g (24.4 ml, 0.25 mol) of redis- 
tilled tetrahydropyran (b.p. 86.5-87.5 °C). The yield of 1,5-dibromopentane, 
b.p. 99 °C/13 mmHg, is 43 g (75%).

Chlorotrimethylsilane (2.7 g, 25mmol) (1) (CAUTION) is added to a solu- 
tion of lithium bromide (1.74g, 20mmol) in dry acetonitrile (20 ml) (2) with 
good stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere. Cinnamyl alcohol (1.34 g, 
lOmmol) is then added and the reaction mixture heated under reflux for 12 
hours. The progress of the reaction is monitored by t.l.c. on silica gel plates 
with hexane as the eluant. On completion of the reaction (12 hours), the reac- 
tion mixture is taken up in ether (50 ml), washed successively with water (2 x 
25 ml), sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (10%, 50 ml) and finally brine, 
and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. Evaporation of the ether affords 
the pure bromide in 93 per cent yield. The product may be recrystallised from 
ethanol and has m.p. 31-32 °C; CAUTION this compound is lachrymatory. 

Notes. (1) Chlorotrimethylsilane is distilled over sodium hydroxide pellets. 
(2) Acetonitrile is purified and stored over molecular sieves.

5.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



5.5.3 PREPARATION OF ALKYL IODIDES FROM ALCOHOLS 

Alkyl iodides are the most easily formed of the alkyl halides and the slow distil- 
lation of the alcohol with constant boiling hydriodic acid is a general method of 
preparation (e.g. Expt 5.57). As with the corresponding chlorides and bromides 
(q.v.), the yields of the required alkyl iodides in this reaction may be diminished 
in the case of certain (tertiary and secondary) alcohols as a result of skeletal re- 
arrangement. 

ROH + HI y RI + H 2 

An alternative reagent, which is particularly effective for the conversion of 
diols into diiodo compounds, is a mixture of potassium iodide and 95 per cent 
orthophosphoric acid (Expt 5.58). The reagent also cleaves tetrahydrofuran and 
tetrahydropyran to yield the corresponding a, co-diiodo compounds [cf. the 
hydrobromic acid-sulphuric acid reagent, Section 5.5.2, p. 559]. 

Regioselectivity may be greatly improved by the use of a varied range of 
phosphorus-based iodinating reagents. For example, the addition of iodine to a 
gently boiling suspension of purified red phosphorus in the alcohol gives excel- 
lent yields of alkyl iodides from primary and secondary alcohols (Expt 5.59). 
Diphosphorus tetraiodide converts alcohols to alkyl iodides at room temperat- 
ure under argon with high regioselectivity. 89 The use of iodotrimethylsilane/ 
sodium iodide in acetonitrile (cf. Expt 5.56) has also been reported. 90 

Reaction of an alcohol with the reagent o-phenylene phosphorochloridite fol- 
lowed by treatment of the alkyl o-phenylene phosphite so obtained with iodine 
in dichloromethane at room temperature results in a good yield of alkyl iodide. 
This method, exemplified by the preparation of 1-iodoheptane (Expt 5.60), is the 
preferred procedure when acid-sensitive functional groups are present. 

Experiment 5.57 ISOPROPYL IODIDE (2-lodopropane) 

Me-CH(OH)-Me + HI *■ Me-CHI-Me + H 2 

Mix 30 g (38 ml, 0.5 mol) of propan-2-ol with 450 g (265 ml) of constant boil- 
ing point hydriodic acid (57%) (Section 4.2.32, p. 436) in a 500-ml distilling 
flask, attach a condenser for downward distillation, and distil slowly (1-2 
drops per second) from an oil or air bath. When about half the liquid has 
passed over, stop the distillation. Separate the lower layer of crude iodide 
(70 g, 82%). Redistil the aqueous layer and thus recover a further 5 g of iodide 
from the first quarter of the distillate (1). Wash the combined iodides with an 
equal volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid, then, successively, with 
water, 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution and water. Dry with anhydrous 
calcium chloride and distil. The isopropyl iodide distils constantly at 89 °C. 

Note. (1) A further quantity of isopropyl iodide, only slightly less than that obtained 
in the first distillation, may be prepared by combining the residues in the distilling 
flask, adding 30 g (38 ml) of propan-2-ol, and repeating the distillation. Finally, the 
residues should be distilled and the 57 per cent constant boiling point acid recovered. 

Cognate preparations. Isobutyl iodide (1 -iodo-2-methylpropane). Use 30 g 
(37.5 ml, 0.37 mol) of 2-methylpropan-l-ol and 273 g (161ml) of 57 per cent 
hydriodic acid; 65 g (96%) of the crude iodide are obtained. If the crude iodide 
is dark in colour, add a little sodium metabisulphite. B.p. 1 19-120 °C.

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.5 



s-Butyl iodide (2-iodobutane). Use 30 g (37.5 ml, 0.37 mol) of butan-2-ol and 
273 g (161 ml) of 57 per cent hydriodic acid; 63 g of crude iodide are obtained, 
b.p. 117.5-1 19 °C. 

Iodocyclopentane. Use 43 g (45.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of cyclopentanol and 340 g 
(200ml) of 57 per cent hydriodic acid; 89 g (91%) of crude iodide are 
obtained, b.p. 58 °C/22 mmHg. 

Allyl iodide. Use 29 g (34 ml, 0.5 mol) of allyl alcohol and 340 g (200 ml) of 57 
per cent hydriodic acid; 74 g (88%) of crude iodide are obtained. Upon adding 
29 g (34 ml) of allyl alcohol to the combined residue in the flask and the 
aqueous layer and distilling as before, a further 72 g of crude allyl iodide may 
be isolated, b.p. 99-101 °C (mainly 100 °C). The compound is very sensitive to 
light; the distillation should therefore be conducted in a darkened room and 
preferably in the presence of a little silver powder.

In a 500-ml three-necked flask, equipped with a thermometer, a sealed stirrer 
unit and a reflux condenser, place 32.5 g of phosphorus pentoxide and add 
1 15.5 g (67.5 ml) of 85 per cent orthophosphoric acid (1). When the stirred 
mixture has cooled to room temperature, introduce 166g (1 mol) of potas- 
sium iodide and 22.5 g (0.25 mol) of redistilled butane- 1,4-diol (b.p. 228- 
230°C or 133-135 °C/18 mmHg). Heat the mixture with stirring at 100- 
120 °C for 4 hours. Cool the stirred mixture to room temperature and add 
75 ml of water and 125 ml of ether. Separate the ethereal layer, decolourise it 
by shaking with 25 ml of 10 per cent sodium thiosulphate solution, wash with 
100 ml of cold saturated sodium chloride solution, and dry with magnesium 
sulphate. Remove the ether by flash distillation (Fig. 2.101) on a steam bath 
and distil the residue from a flask with fractionating side-arm under dimin- 
ished pressure. Collect the 1,4-diiodobutane at 110°C/6mmHg, the yield is 
65g(84%). 

Alternatively, add 18 g (20 ml, 0.25 mol) of redistilled tetrahydrofuran (b.p. 
65-66 °C) to a mixture of 32.5 g of phosphorus pentoxide, 1 15.5 g (67.5 ml) of 
85 per cent orthophosphoric acid and 1 66 g of potassium iodide, heat for 3-4 
hours, cool and isolate the 1,4-diiodobutane as above. The yield of product, 
b.p. 1 10 °C/6 mmHg, is 70 g (90%). 

Note. (1) The orthophosphoric acid must be adjusted to a concentration of 95 per 
cent H3PO4. Alternatively, the commercial 100 per cent orthophosphoric acid may be 
diluted with water to this concentration. The 95 per cent acid is claimed to be the most 
efficient for the preparation of iodides from alcohols and glycols, and for effecting 
cleavage of tetrahydrofuran and tetrahydropyran. Anhydrous orthophosphoric acid 
does not give such good results because of the limited solubility of hydrogen iodide in 
the reagent. 

Cognate preparations. 1,5-Diiodopentane (from pentane-l,5-diol). Proceed as 
for 1,4-diiodobutane but use 26 g (26.5 ml, 0.25 mol) of redistilled pentane-

1,5-diol (b.p. 238-239 °C) in place of the butane- 1,4-diol. The yield of 1,5-di- 
iodopentane, b.p. 142-143 °C/16mmHg, is 65 g (80%). 

1,5-Diiodopentane (from tetrahydropyran). Use 21.5 g (24.4 ml, 0.25 mol) of 
redistilled tetrahydropyran (b.p. 86.5-87.5 °C) in place of the tetrahydro- 
furan, otherwise proceed as for 1,4-diiodobutane. The yield of 1,5-diiodo- 
pentane, b.p. 142-143 °C/16mmHg, is 71 g (88%). 

1,6-Diiodohexane. Proceed exactly as detailed for 1,4-diiodobutane but re- 
place the butane- 1,4-diol by 29.5 g (0.25 mol) hexane-l,6-diol, m.p. 41-42 °C. 
The yield of 1,6-diiodohexane, b.p. 150°C/10mmHg, m.p. 10 °C, is 70g 

(83%). 

Butyl iodide. Use 37 g (46 ml, 0.5 mol) of butan-1-ol together with the quanti- 
ties of the other reactants used above; a 2-hour reaction time is sufficient. The 
yield of butyl iodide, b.p. 129-130 °C, is 64 g (70%). 

Iodocyclohexane. Proceed as for butyl iodide using 50 g (0.5 mol) of redis- 
tilled cyclohexanol (b.p. 160-161 °C). Distil the iodocyclohexane under 
reduced pressure, b.p. 67-69 °C/9mmHg; the yield is 90 g (86%).

Place 12.5 g (0.4 mol) of purified red phosphorus (Section 4.2.59, p. 458) and 
78 g (96 ml, 1.05 mol) of butan-1-ol in a 250-ml round-bottomed flask fitted 
with a Liebig-type reflux condenser. Heat the mixture to gentle refluxing with 
a Bunsen flame over a wire gauze. Remove or lower the flame and add 127g 
(0.5 mol) of coarsely powdered iodine in approximately 2 g portions down the 
centre of the condenser. Complete the entire addition of the iodine fairly 
rapidly (i.e. in about 20-30 minutes), but allow the mildly exothermic reac- 
tion to subside after the addition of each portion. Finally continue heating 
under reflux for 30-60 minutes; little or no iodine should then be visible. 
Arrange the condenser for downward distillation and distil off most of the 
crude product. When the volume of liquid in the flask has been reduced to 
about 1 5-20 ml, add about 40 ml of water and continue the distillation until 
no more oily drops pass over into the receiver (1). Separate the crude alkyl 
iodide and wash it successively with approximately equal volumes of water, 
concentrated hydrochloric acid (2), water, 10 per cent sodium carbonate solu- 
tion and water (3). Dry the product over anhydrous calcium chloride and 
distil, collecting the butyl iodide which passes over at 129-131 °C; the yield is 
165g(90%)(4). 

Notes. (1) See Expt 5.55, Note (1). 

(2) The washing with concentrated hydrochloric acid removes any unchanged alcohol 
which may be present. 

(3) If the washed organic phase is darker than a pale brown-pink, add a few crystals of 
sodium thiosulphate to the final wash-water to remove traces of iodine.

o-Phenylene phosphorochloridite. Place llOg (1.0 mol) of catechol (pyro- 
catechol) in a 500-ml three-necked flask supported on a water bath and mois- 
ten it with about 2 ml of water. Equip the flask with an efficient mechanical 
stirrer, a large double surface reflux condenser and a 250-ml dropping funnel. 
Connect the mouth of the condenser to an efficient gas absorption trap (Fig.

ping funnel during 1 5 minutes with vigorous stirring. There is a brisk evolu- 
tion of hydrogen chloride and the contents of the flask soon solidify, stopping 
the stirrer. Leave the reaction mixture standing at room temperature for 1 
hour, and then heat the water bath to boiling. The solid mass soon melts and 
stirring again becomes possible. Continue to heat on the boiling water bath

with stirring for 2 hours. Arrange the flask for distillation under reduced pres- 
sure (water pump); insert a trap cooled in an acetone-Cardice mixture 
between the receiver and the pump. Distil the product and collect the o-phe- 
nylene phosphorochloridite as a fraction of b.p. 98°C/25mmHg (91 °C/ 
18mmHg). The yield is 165g (95%); the product crystallises in the refrigera- 
tor, m.p. 30 °C. About 50 g of unreacted phosphorus trichloride is collected in 
the trap. 

Heptyl o-phenylene phosphite. Place 87.0 g (0.5 mol) of o-phenylene phos- 
phorochloridite, 39.5 g (0.05 mol) of dry redistilled pyridine and 500 ml of dry 
ether, in a 2-litre conical flask and cool to 0°C. Add 58.1 g (0.5 mol) of 
heptan-1-ol dissolved in 400 ml of dry ether during about 5 minutes with 
occasional shaking. Stopper the flask and allow the reaction to proceed at 
room temperature overnight. Filter off the precipitated pyridinium chloride 
under suction, wash well with dry ether and remove the ether from the com- 
bined filtrate and washings on a rotary evaporator to obtain 127.0 g (100%) 
of heptyl o-phenylene phosphite as a colourless oil of sufficient purity for use 
in the next stage. 

1-Iodoheptane. In a conical flask, stir magnetically at room temperature a 
solution of 50.9 g (0.20 mol) of heptyl o-phenylene phosphite in 500 ml of dry 
dichloromethane and add 50.8 g (0.20 mol) of iodine. After 1 hour (1) transfer 
the solution to a separatory funnel and wash the organic layer with 400 ml of 
10 per cent aqueous sodium thiosulphate solution to remove any residual 
unreacted iodine. Wash the organic layer twice with 400 ml portions of 5 per 
cent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution to remove the o-phenylene phos- 
phoroiodate by-product, followed by two 400 ml portions of 5 per cent 
aqueous sodium metabisulphite, and finally with 400 ml of a saturated solu- 
tion of sodium chloride. Dry the organic layer with anhydrous calcium sul- 
phate, filter and remove the solvent on a rotary evaporator. The yield of 
crude 1-iodoheptane is 41.8 g (92%). Fractionally redistil the product under 
reduced pressure using a nitrogen capillary leak when 39 g (86%) of the pure 
material having b.p. 96-104 °C/46-48mmHg is obtained. 

Note. (1) The reaction may be monitored by g.l.c. by the direct loading of a sample 
(0.1 pi) on to an S.E. 30-column, 1.5 m, held at 170 °C (nitrogen flow 40 ml/minute). 
The retention time of 1 -iodoheptane is 52 seconds; that of heptyl o-phenylene phos- 
phite under the same conditions is 4 minutes. 

5.5.4 DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS INVOLVING A HALOGEN ATOM 

Alkyl fluorides may be prepared in moderate yield by interaction of an alkyl 
bromide with anhydrous potassium fluoride in the presence of dry ethylene 
glycol as a solvent for the inorganic fluoride (e.g. Expt 5.61). A little alkene 
accompanies the alkyl fluoride produced and is readily removed by treatment 
with KBr/Br 2 solution.

CAUTION: Alkyl fluorides are said to be highly toxic. Great care should be 
taken not to inhale the vapours; conduct the entire operation in an efficient fume 
cupboard. 

In a dry 500-ml three-necked flask, equipped with a sealed stirrer unit, a 
100-ml dropping funnel and a short fractionating column (1), place a mixture 
of 116g (2mol) of anhydrous, finely powdered potassium fluoride (2) and 
200 g of dry ethylene glycol (3). Connect the fractionating column (which 
carries a thermometer) to a downward double surface condenser fitted with a 
receiving flask with the aid of a side-arm adapter. Heat the flask in an oil bath 
at 160-170 °C and introduce 165 g (141 ml, 1 mol) of 1-bromohexane (Expt 
5.55) dropwise, with stirring, during 5 hours. A liquid passes over inter- 
mittently at 60-90 °C. When the addition is complete, allow the bath temper- 
ature to fall to 1 10-120 °C; replace the dropping funnel by a tube of narrow 
bore dipping just below the surface of the liquid, attach the side-arm of the 
receiver adapter to a water pump, and draw a slow stream of air through the 
apparatus while maintaining the stirring. It is advisable to interpose a trap 
(e.g. a Drechsel bottle) cooled in ice between the water pump and receiver in 
order to recover any uncondensed liquid. Distil the combined distillates 
through an efficient fractionating column (4); after a small forerun (0.5 g) of 
hex-1-ene collect the crude 1-fluorohexane at 92-97 °C. Purify the crude 
product by cooling in ice and adding 1 ml portions of a solution containing 
9.0 g of bromine and 6.0 g of potassium bromide in 50 ml of water until the 
organic layer acquires an orange colour: shake the mixture vigorously for a 
minute or so after each addition. The volume of KBr/Br 2 solution required is 
usually less than 5 ml. Separate the aqueous layer, wash the organic layer 
with saturated aqueous potassium bromide solution until colourless, and 
finally with water. Dry the liquid with magnesium sulphate and fractionate. 
Collect the fraction 92-94 °C: the yield is 44 g (42%). The colourless liquid 
keeps unchanged for long periods. 

Notes. (1) Any fractionating column of moderate efficiency is satisfactory, e.g. a 
Dufton column (20 cm long containing a spiral 10 cm in length, 2 cm in diameter with 
8 turns of the helix) or a Vigreux column (20-25 cm long). 

(2) Grind finely pure laboratory grade, anhydrous potassium fluoride, and heat it in 
an electrically heated oven at 180-210 °C; store in a desiccator. Before use, dry the

5.5.5 DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS INVOLVING A METHANESULPHONYLOXY GROUP 

Alcohols, as their derived methanesulphonates, may be readily converted into 
alkyl halides by reaction with inorganic halides under PTC conditions. With 
chiral substrates the reaction is often highly stereospecific in that inversion of 
configuration (sometimes better than 90%) is obtained. The example in Expt 
5.63, is the preparation of 2-bromomethyl-l,4-dioxaspiro[4,5]decane from gly- 
cerol. This reaction sequence is of interest in that two hydroxyl groups of gly- 
cerol are first protected by conversion into a cyclic acetal with cyclohexanone 
(cf. Section 5.4.6, p. 553); the remaining hydroxyl group is reacted with methane- 
sulphonyl chloride before being displaced by a bromide ion.

methane (15 ml) is added, the organic layer separated and the residue 
extracted with a further portion of dichloromethane (15 ml). The combined 
organic extracts are dried with magnesium sulphate and the solvent evapor- 
ated. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give the product (4.9 g,

5.5.6 DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS INVOLVING THE AMINO GROUP 

Until recently no satisfactory procedure for the direct conversion of a primary 
aliphatic amine into an alkyl halide was available. This contrasts sharply with 
the ready conversion of primary aromatic amines into aryl halides via the 
diazonium salt (Section 6.7, p. 922). However a useful method has not been dis- 
covered which is not only applicable to the synthesis of simple alkyl and aralkyl 
chlorides, bromides, iodides and fluorides, but could clearly be of value when it 
is required to replace an amino group in a naturally occurring amine by a halo- 
gen. 92 

The outline procedure involves the initial reaction of the 2,4,6-triphenyl- 
pyrylium halide with the primary amine to yield the corresponding 2,4,6- 
triphenylpyridinium halide (see Section 8.4.1, and also Section 5.15.3, p. 768); this 
reaction proceeds either at room temperature in a suitable solvent, or more effi- 
ciently under reflux in benzene with azeotropic removal of water. Pyrolysis of 
the pyridinium halide under controlled conditions then yields the alkyl (or ar- 
alkyl) halide in good yield. The mechanism of the reaction in this case is probably 
of the Sjy2 type.

5.5.7 ADDITION OF HYDROGEN HALIDES OR HALOGENS TO ALKENES 

Direct addition of a hydrogen halide to an alkene gives rise to an alkyl halide, 
the order of reactivity being HI&gt;HBr&gt;HCl. In the case of an unsymmetrical 
alkene, the regioselectivity of the reaction may be predicted from the mechanism 
of the reaction. Thus, the carbocation which is the most stabilised by charge dis- 
persal will be the one which is formed preferentially. Classically the mode of 
addition is described as proceeding in the Markownikoff manner.

Addition of hydrogen halide (1 mol) to a diene (1 mol) is a method of greater 
preparative value. This reaction is illustrated by the addition of hydrogen 
bromide to isoprene (Expt 5.64); the overall 1,4-addition process (thermo- 
dynamically controlled), as opposed to the 1,2-addition (kinetically controlled), 
predominates under the conditions specified.

The addition of hydrogen bromide (but not the iodide or chloride) in the 
presence of an added peroxide catalyst proceeds by a radical mechanism, giving 
rise to a regioselectivity which is opposite to that of the ionic mechanism (ant i- 
Markownikoff). An example is provided in the preparation of 11-bromo- 
undecanoic acid (Expt 5.65).

Such 'anti-Markownikoff' regioselectivity may be achieved in the formation 
of iodides by proceeding via the corresponding organoborane, which is then 
decomposed with iodine in the presence of sodium methoxide 93 (Expt 5.66). 
More recently iodine monochloride has been found to be an economic alterna- 
tive iodinating agent. 94

The addition of bromine usually proceeds the most smoothly, and is conve- 
niently carried out in a solvent such as carbon tetrachloride. The examples of the 
addition of bromine to allyl bromide and the addition of bromine to undec-10- 
enoic acid are illustrative (Expts 5.67 and 5.23).

CAUTION: The entire preparation must be carried out in an efficient fume cup- 
board since the product is highly lachrymatory. 

Weigh a 100-ml three-necked flask fitted with stoppers. Remove the 
stoppers and attach to the flask a mechanical stirrer, a calcium chloride 
guard-tube to the outlet of which is connected a tube leading to the fume cup- 
board drain, and a gas inlet tube terminating in a glass frit and attached to a 
dry hydrogen bromide gas generator (Section 4.2 .37, p. 437). Charge the flask 
with 34 g (0.5 mol) of redistilled 2-methylbuta-l,3-diene (isoprene) (1), cool in 
an ice-salt bath and pass dry hydrogen bromide gas slowly through the reac- 
tion mixture until an increase in weight of 40 g is obtained (2); this may re- 
quire about 6 hours. Now fit the flask with a Vigreux column in the central 
joint and with a stopper and a suitable capillary air leak in the side joints. 
Fractionally distil the crude l-bromo-3-methylbut-2-ene under reduced pres- 
sure (ensure that suitable potassium hydroxide traps are sited between the 
apparatus and the oil immersion rotatory pump) and collect the pure product 
of b.p. 56-57 °C/25 mmHg; the yield is 58 g (78%). 

Notes. (1) Isoprene is purchased in sealed capsules. These are usually stored in a 
refrigerator and only removed just prior to opening and redistillation of the isoprene. 
A simple distillation unit may be employed using a double surface condenser, the

efficient cooling. The distillation receiver should be cooled and the outlet protected 
with a calcium chloride guard-tube. Pure isoprene has a b.p. 33-34 °C. 
(2) The reaction flask should be removed and replaced by a similar flask to ensure that 
the stirrer and gas inlet tube do not become unnecessarily contaminated with mois- 
ture. The reaction flask should be stoppered with the same stoppers used in the 
original weighing.

(Section 4.2.37, p. 437)] through the stirred mixture until it is saturated (about 
0.75 hour) while maintaining the temperature between 10 and 20 °C by occa- 
sional cooling. Should a white solid separate and tend to block the inlet tube 
towards the end of the reaction, either add a further small portion of dry light 
petroleum or maintain the temperature nearer to 20 °C when the material 
should dissolve. 

Decant the pale straw-coloured solution into a conical flask and rinse the 
reaction vessel with 40 ml of light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C) and combine 
with the main solution. Cool the solution to — 10 °C and collect the solid 
which separates by filtration under suction and wash with about 40 ml of 
similarly cooled light petroleum. A further quantity of the product may be 
obtained by concentrating the filtrate to about 40 ml and cooling. Dissolve 
the crude product in approximately 200 ml of boiling light petroleum (b.p. 
40-60 °C), add decolourising charcoal, filter, concentrate to about 1 50 ml and 
cool. Collect the 11-bromoundecanoic acid which separates as microcrystal- 
line platelike needles, m.p. 49-50 °C. A further quantity of slightly less pure 
acid may be obtained by concentrating the mother-liquors to about 30 ml

and methyl undec-10-enoate (33.7 ml, 150mmol) and cooled to °C in an ice 
bath. Conversion to the trialkylborane is achieved by the dropwise addition 
of neat borane-methyl sulphide (5.10ml) over 40 minutes. The ice bath is 
removed and the reaction allowed to stir over 1 hour at room temperature. 
Then absolute methanol is added to destroy traces of residual hydride. Iodine 
(38.1 g, 150mmol) is added all at once, followed by the dropwise addition of a 
solution of sodium methoxide in methanol (31.8 ml of a 4.72 m solution, 
150mmol) over a period of 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir 
for 24 hours. Gas-liquid chromatography analysis (10% Dow Corning on 
Chromosorb W, 1.8 m x 6.3 mm) of the reaction mixture using decane for an 
internal standard indicates an 80 per cent yield of methyl 11-iodoundecan- 
oate. A saturated aqueous sodium thiosulphate solution is poured into the 
reaction mixture until excess iodine is decolourised. The reaction mixture is 
extracted with pentane (100 ml) and dried over magnesium sulphate. Distilla-

Provide a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a dropping funnel carrying a calcium

bon tetrachloride (CAUTION, p. 399), and introduce 255 g (80 ml, 1.6 mol) 
of dry bromine (CAUTION, p. 422) into the dropping funnel. Set the stirrer 
in motion and when the temperature has fallen to — 5 °C, drop the bromine in 
slowly at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above °C (about 90 
minutes). Allow the orange-coloured solution (the colour is due to a slight 
excess of bromine) to warm to room temperature with constant stirring 
(about 30 minutes) and then remove the solvent under reduced pressure on a 
rotary evaporator. Distil the residue under reduced pressure; the residual car- 
bon tetrachloride passes over first, followed by 1,2,3-tribromopropane at 92- 
93 °C/10mmHg or 100-103 °C/18mmHg as an almost colourless liquid. The 
yield is 400 g (95%).

5.58 THE REPLACEMENT OF REACTIVE ALLYLIC HYDROGEN ATOMS BY BROMINE 

The direct introduction of bromine into the allylic position of an alkene using 
JV-bromosuccinimide is known as the Wohl-Ziegler reaction. Bromination is 
carried out in anhydrous reagents (to avoid hydrolysis of the bromoimide), 
usually boiling carbon tetrachloride or chloroform solution. The progress of the 
reaction can be followed by the fact that at first the dense N-bromosuccinimide 
is at the bottom of the flask and is gradually replaced by succinimide, which rises 

577 



5.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



to the surface: the reaction is complete when all the crystals are floating at the 
surface (detected by stopping the boiling momentarily). This can be confirmed 
(when equimolar amounts are used) by transferring a drop of the solution to 
acidified potassium iodide-starch solution: iodine should not be liberated. After 
cooling, the insoluble succinimide is filtered off, washed with solvent and the 
product isolated, after removal of the solvent, by distillation or crystallisation. 
The specific substitution into the allylic position is the result of a radical pro- 
cess which requires the generation of a low concentration of molecular bromine, 
probably by way of the action of traces of hydrogen bromide on the 
bromoimide.

Two simple applications may be mentioned. With cyclohexene, 3-bromo- 
cyclohexene is obtained in a satisfactory yield (Expt 5.68), the latter upon 
dehydrobromination with quinoline affords an 80-90 per cent yield of cyclo- 
hexa-l,3-diene (Expt 5.13). Methyl crotonate yields the valuable synthetic 
reagent methyl y-bromocrotonate {Expt 5.69); this latter compound permits the 
introduction (in moderate yield) of a four-carbon atom chain at the site of the 
carbon yl group by the use of the Reformatsky reaction (compare Expt 5.170):

CAUTION: Since many simple unsubstituted allylic compounds are powerful 
irritants by inhalation and by skin contact, this preparation should be carried 
out in an efficient fume cupboard and the product treated with appropriate 
caution. 

In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask place 39.4 g (0.20 mol) of JV-bromo- 
succinimide (Section 4.2.70, p. 422), 49.2 g (0.60 mol) of redistilled cyclo- 
hexene, 150 ml of carbon tetrachloride and about 500 mg of benzoyl peroxide 
(CAUTION: Section 4.2.6, p. 417), previously dried by pressing between filter 
papers. Attach a double surface reflux condenser and allow the mixture to 
stand at room temperature when after a short induction period the reaction 
begins. The reaction mixture becomes warm and the heavy yellowish N- 
bromosuccinimide begins to be transformed into the light colourless succini- 
mide which becomes suspended in the reaction mixture. When the reaction 
has moderated somewhat, transfer the flask to a steam bath and heat under 
reflux until all the JV-bromosuccinimide has been converted to succinimide 
(about 1.5 hours) (1). Cool the flask, filter under suction and wash the residue

with a little carbon tetrachloride. Distil the filtrate and washings on a boiling 
water bath from a flask fitted with a Claisen still-head to remove most of the 
carbon tetrachloride (b.p. 77 °C) and unreacted cyclohexene (b.p. 83 °C). 
Then fractionally distil the residue (2) under reduced pressure (water pump). 
Further quantities (about 50 g) of cyclohexene and carbon tetrachloride are 
obtained as a first fraction, followed by the main fraction (about 24 g) of b.p. 
72-77 °C/32-35 mmHg, which is only about 50 per cent pure by g.l.c. analysis 
and which rapidly goes brown on standing. Subsequent redistillation under 
reduced pressure and using a short Vigreux column (12 cm) gives 14.4 g (45%) 
of colourless mobile 3-bromocyclohexene of b.p. 66-67 °C/20 mmHg, which 
is 99 per cent pure by g.l.c. analysis (10% Silicone oil on Chromosorb W, 
1.5-m column held at 85 °C, nitrogen flow rate 40 ml/minute, t R 10.4 minutes). 

Notes. (1) The completion of the reaction may be confirmed by treating starch-iodide 
paper with a drop of the reaction solution. At the end of the reaction no coloration is 
observed. 

(2) The flask and still-head should preferably have at least 24/29 sized joints to pre- 
vent losses due to foaming.

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The i.r. spectra of dialkyl ethers show the expected absorptions due to the vibra- 
tions of the carbon-hydrogen skeletal structure, together with the asymmetric 
stretching of the carbon-oxygen bond at 1150-1060 cm -1 (cf. dibutyl ether, Fig. 
3.24). Benzyl, allyl and vinylic ethers exhibit further appropriate absorption due 
to the presence of the aromatic ring or of the carbon-carbon double bond. The 
structure of the alkyl group may be assigned from the p.m.r. spectrum in those 
cases where a first-order, or near first-order, spectrum is possible (see p. 341 for 
splitting patterns of alkyl groups). The fragmentation pattern in the m.s. of 
dialkyl ethers is discussed on p. 376 and may provide further information on the 

580

structure of the alkyl groups. Saturated aliphatic ethers do not absorb in the 
accessible region of the u.v '.-visible region of the spectrum. 

5.6.1 THE FORMATION OF ETHERS FROM ALCOHOLS UNDER ACIDIC CONDITIONS 

Diethyl ether (Et 2 0) can be prepared by heating ethanol with sulphuric acid at 
about 140 °C, and adding more alcohol as the ether distils out of the reaction 
medium. A similar 'continuous etherification process' is used industrially. A 
more general procedure for the preparation of symmetrical ethers from primary 
alcohols (e.g. dibutyl ether, Expt 5.70) is to arrange for the water formed in the 
reaction to be removed azeotropically. 

2R-CH 2 OH -^°i&gt; R-CH : -OCH 2 -R + H 2 

Excessive heating of the reaction mixture must be avoided otherwise an alkene- 
forming elimination reaction is induced; this is particularly the case with second- 
ary and especially tertiary alcohols. 

Tetrahydropyranyl ethers are readily prepared from the alcohol and 2,3- 
tetrahydropyran in the presence of acid, and the reaction is widely used as a 
method of protection of hydroxyl groups. Preparative procedures and the 
methods of deprotection are given in Section 5.4.6, p. 551). 

The synthesis of dichloromethyl methyl ether has been included because of its 
usefulness as a reagent for the preparation of aromatic aldehydes (Expt 6. 1 1 5). It 
is readily obtained by the reaction of phosphorus pentachloride in admixture 
with phosphorus oxychloride with methyl formate (Expt 5.71). 

Chloromethyl methyl ether and bis-chloromethyl ether (ClCH 2 '0-CH 2 C\) in 
common with several alkylating agents possess carcinogenic properties in ex- 
perimental animals and have been listed as assumed human carcinogens; similar 
hazardous properties associated with dichloromethyl methyl ether have not 
been reported but it would be prudent to handle this compound with due care.

— H2O 

The success of this preparation depends on the use of the Dean and Stark 
apparatus [Fig. 2.31(a)] which permits the automatic separation of water 
produced in the reaction. The quantity of water which should be eliminated, 
assuming a quantitative conversion of the alcohol (0.67 mol) into the ether, is 
6.0 g (0.33 mol). Equip a 250-ml two-necked round-bottomed flask with the 
Dean and Stark apparatus in the central socket; attach a reflux condenser in 
the upper joint. Fill the graduated side-arm with water and then drain off 6 ml 
(the quantity to be formed in the reaction). Place 49 g (61ml, 0.67 mol) of 
butan-1-ol together with 16 g (9 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in the 
flask. Using a screw-capped cone adapter, insert a thermometer in the side 
socket of the flask with the bulb immersed in the liquid. Heat the flask gently 
so that the liquid refluxes from the condenser. Water and butan-1-ol will 
collect in the graduated side-arm and when this is full automatic separation 
of the two liquids will commence; the water will fall to the bottom of the tube 
and the lighter butan-1-ol will pass back into the flask. Continue the heating 

581 



5.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



until the temperature in the flask rises to 134-135 °C (after about 30-40 
minutes). At this stage 5-6 ml of additional water will have collected in the 
graduated side-arm and the reaction may be regarded as complete. Further 
heating will merely result in considerable darkening of the mixture in the 
flask and the forming of the highly flammable but-1-ene. Allow the reaction 
mixture to cool or cool the flask under running water from the tap. Pour the 
contents of the flask and water-separator tube into a separatory funnel con- 
taining 100 ml of water, shake well and remove the upper layer containing the 
crude ether mixed with a little unchanged butanol. Shake the crude ether with 
25 ml of cold 50 per cent by weight sulphuric acid (from 20 ml of concentrated 
acid cautiously poured into 35 ml of water) (1) for 2-3 minutes, separate the 
upper layer and repeat the extraction with another 25 ml of the acid. Finally 
wash twice with 25 ml portions of water; dry with 2 g of anhydrous calcium 
chloride (2). Filter through a fluted filter paper into a 50 ml flask and distil. 
Collect the dibutyl ether at 139-142 °C. The yield is 15 g (34%). Record the i.r. 
spectrum and compare it with Fig. 3.24. Interpret the m.s. of dibutyl ether 
which shows principal fragmentation ions at m/z 87, 57 (base peak), 56, 41, 29 
and 27. 

Notes. (1) This separation utilises the fact that butan-1-ol is soluble in 50 per cent sul- 
phuric acid by weight, whereas dibutyl ether is only slightly soluble. 
(2) An alternative method for isolating dibutyl ether utilises the fact that butan-1-ol is 
soluble in saturated calcium chloride solution while dibutyl ether is slightly soluble. 
Cool the reaction mixture in ice and transfer to a separatory funnel. Wash cautiously 
with 100 ml of 2.5-3 m sodium hydroxide solution; the washings should be alkaline to 
litmus. Then wash with 30 ml of water, followed by 30 ml of saturated calcium chloride 
solution. Dry with 2-3 g anhydrous calcium chloride. 

Cognate preparation. Dihexyl ether. Use 68 g (83 ml, 0.67 mol) of hexan-1-ol 
(b.p. 156-157 °C); heat until the temperature rises to 180 °C. Pour the reac- 
tion mixture into water, separate the upper layer, wash it twice with 5 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution, then with water, and dry over anhydrous potas- 
sium carbonate. Distil and collect the fractions of b.p. (i) 160-221 °C (23 g) 
and (ii) 221-223 °C (23 g). Reflux fraction (i) with 5g of sodium and distil 
from the excess of sodium when a further quantity of fairly pure dihexyl ether 
(1 3 g, fraction (iii)) is thus obtained. Combine fractions (ii) and (iii) and distil 
from a little sodium; collect the pure dihexyl ether (26 g, 42%) at 221.5— 
223 °C.

In a fume cupboard equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a dropping 
funnel, a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer and a reflux condenser, using a 
double-neck adapter (Fig. 2.15) to accommodate the last two items. Protect 
the condenser and dropping funnel with calcium chloride guard-tubes. Place 
50 ml of phosphorus oxychloride and 156 g (0.75 mol) of phosphorus pen- 
tachloride in the flask and 48 g (49 ml, 0.8 mol) of methyl formate in the drop- 
ping funnel. Cool the mixture to 10 °C and add the methyl formate dropwise 
at such a rate that the reaction temperature does not rise above 20 °C (about

1 hour). When the addition is complete, remove the ice-bath, stir the mixture 
until all the phosphorus pentachloride has dissolved, keeping the tempera- 
ture below 30 °C by occasional cooling. Remove the stirrer, condenser, ther- 
mometer and dropping funnel, stopper the two side-necks and insert a simple 
distillation head into the central neck. Introduce a pine splint to serve as an 
anti-bumping device (1) and attach a condenser leading to a receiver flask via 
a receiver adapter for vacuum distillation. Distil the reaction mixture under 
reduced pressure (water pump) on a water bath at about 60 °C and collect the 
distillate in a flask cooled to —25 to — 30 °C in a cooling bath (acetone-Car- 
dice or ice-salt). The distillate weighs 209 g and consists of a mixture of dich- 
loromethyl methyl ether (b.p. 85 °C) and phosphorus oxychloride (b.p. 
105 °C). Fractionally distil the mixture at atmospheric pressure through a 
50-cm column filled with glass helices and surrounded by a heating jacket at 
60 °C, using a reflux ratio of about 1:8 (Section 2.26). Collect the fraction 
which boils between 82 and 95 °C and refractionate to give 70 g (76%) pure 
dichloromethyl methyl ether, b.p. 85 °C. Protect the product from moisture. 

Note. (1) A conventional capillary air leak, inserted into a side-neck, should only be 
used in this case if the air supply is pre-dried since the product is susceptible to de- 
composition by moisture. 

5.6.2 THE INTERACTION OF AN ALCOHOL WITH A HALOGEN COMPOUND UNDER 
BASIC CONDITIONS 

This involves the direct nucleophilic displacement of halogen in an alkyl halide 
by an alkoxide ion (the Williamson synthesis) (Expt 5.72), and the method is par- 
ticularly useful for the preparation of mixed ethers. For an unsymmetrical ether 
[e.g. t-butyl ethyl ether (7)], the disconnection approach suggests two feasible 
routes.

(Me,CX=)Me,C® e OEt ^L r -| &gt; Ft ==&gt; Me,CO e Et®(=EtX) 



The selection of reagents is governed by availability, cost, and, more import- 
antly, the possible intrusion of side reactions. Thus in the above example, the 
action of the strongly basic ethoxide ion on t-butyl bromide would give rise to 
extensive alkene formation; on the other hand little or no elimination would 
occur by the alternative reaction route. In general therefore, secondary or tertiary 
alkyl groups can only be incorporated into ethers by the Williamson synthesis 
by way of the corresponding alkoxide ions in reaction with a primary halide. 
The preparation of alkyl methyl ethers may be readily effected under PTC 
conditions from the alcohol, dimethyl sulphate and 50 per cent w/w aqueous 
sodium hydroxide, employing tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulphate as 
catalyst. 95 The usefulness of this procedure has been extended, and optimum 
conditions have been described for the alkylation of a range of aliphatic alcohols 
using, for example, 1-chlorobutane or benzyl chloride. 96 The PTC preparative 
examples described in Expt 5.73 are for the methylation, allylation, but-2- 
enylation and benzylation of, for example, 2-hydroxymethyl-l,4- 
dioxaspiro[4.5]decane (Expt 5.63), and have been developed in the editors' 
laboratories. These methods have also been applied to the alkylation of pro- 
tected monosaccharide derivatives (p. 652).

Place 204 g (250 ml, 2mol) of dry hexan-1-ol in a 500-ml round-bottomed 
flask fitted with a Liebig-type reflux condenser and introduce 5.75 g 
(0.25 mol) of clean sodium (Section 4.2.65, p. 462) in small pieces and warm 
under reflux until all the sodium has reacted (c. 2 hours). Introduce 39 g 
(20 ml, 0.25 mol) of ethyl iodide down the condenser from a dropping funnel 
and reflux gently for 2 hours; sodium iodide gradually separates. Arrange the 
apparatus for downward distillation and collect the crude ether at 143- 
148 °C (27 g). When cold, refit the reflux condenser, add a further 5.75 g 
(0.25 mol) of clean sodium and warm until all has reacted: alternatively, allow 
the reaction to proceed overnight, by which time all the sodium will have 
reacted. Introduce a further 39 g (20 ml, 0.25 mol) of ethyl iodide and reflux 
for 2 hours; distil off the crude ether and collect the fraction passing over at 
143-148 °C. Combine the two distillates. Remove most of the hexan-1-ol still 
present in the crude ether by heating under reflux for 2 hours with a large 
excess of sodium and then distil until no more liquid passes over. Distil the 
resulting liquid from a few grams of sodium using a short fractionating col- 
umn, and collect the ethyl hexyl ether at 140-143 °C. The yield is 30 g (46%). 
If the sodium is appreciably attacked, indicating that all the alcohol has not 
been completely removed, repeat the distillation from a little fresh sodium.

residues.)

vigorously at room temperature until t.l.c. analysis (1) reveals that the reac- 
tion is complete (usually about 3 hours). Add 1 ml of concentrated aqueous 
ammonia and stir for a further 30 minutes at room temperature to decom- 
pose excess dimethyl sulphate. Pour the reaction mixture into water, add

5.7 ALIPHATIC ALDEHYDES 

The carbonyl group in an aldehyde is by definition at the terminal position in 
the carbon chain (R'CH 2 , CH 2 -CHO). Branching in the carbon chain, or the 
presence of a functional substituent group, is located by systematic numbering; 
letters of the Greek alphabet may be used to specify in general terms substituents 
relative to the carbonyl carbon. Illustrative representations are shown below for: 

2-methylpropanal (1) CH 3 -CH(CH 3 )-CHO; 
3-methylbutanal (2) CH 3 -CH(CH 3 )-CH 2 CHO; 
3-hydroxybutanal (3) CH 3 -CH(OH)-CH 2 -CHO; 

compound (3a) could be described in general terms as a /?-hydroxyaldehyde, 
and the alternative representation (3b) emphasises the possibility of intra- 
molecular hydrogen bonding.

The presence of branching or of functional group substitution in the carbon 
chain leads to the possibility of a chiral site(*). Thus compound (3) is chiral but 
compounds (1) and (2) are achiral. a, ^-Unsaturated aldehydes 
(R-CH=CH-CHO) are considered in Section 5.18.2, p. 798. 

The synthesis of aliphatic aldehydes is exemplified by the following typical 
procedures. 

1. The controlled oxidation or dehydrogenation of primary alcohols (Expts 5.74 

to 5.76). 

2. The oxidative cleavage of 1,2-diols (Expts 5.77 and 5.78). 

3. The ozonolysis of suitably substituted alkenes (Expt 5.79). 

4. The reduction of nitriles, carboxylic acids and carboxylic acid chlorides 
(Expts 5.80 and 5.81). 

5. Methods based upon alkyl halides (Expt 5.82).

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The presence of the formyl group ( — CHO) of an aldehyde is definitively recog- 
nised from the i.r. absorption spectrum and from the p.m.r. spectrum. In the 
former, the absorption frequency of the carbonyl group occurs in the region of 
1745cm" 1 , and that of the carbon-hydrogen bond as two weak absorptions 
near 2820 and 2720 cm " l (Fig. 3.29, cyclohexanecarboxyaldehyde). These latter 
absorptions allow structural distinction to be made between aldehydes and 
other carbonyl-containing compounds. The aldehydic hydrogen may also be 
readily assigned in the p.m.r. spectrum as its absorption occurs at very low field 
(Fig. 3.72, crotonaldehyde). The skeletal structure of an aliphatic aldehyde may 
sometimes be deduced from a first-order analysis of the multiplicity of the 
signals corresponding to the alkyl groups (p. 341). The l3 C-n.m.r. spectrum of 
crotonaldehyde (Fig. 3.52) is illustrative of deshielding effects. The important 
fragmentations which are observed in the m.s. of aliphatic aldehydes are dis- 
cussed on p. 377. Further descriptive accounts of structural assignments are to 
be found in some of the preparative examples below. Saturated aliphatic alde- 
hydes show very weak and barely detectable absorption in the accessible region 
of the u.v.-visible spectrum near 270 nm; this absorption is attributed to the 
n -» 7i* transition. 

5.7.1 THE CONTROLLED OXIDATION OR DEHYDROGENATION OF PRIMARY ALCOHOLS 

Simple aldehydes may be obtained in reasonably good yield by oxidation of the 
corresponding primary alcohol with sodium dichromate in dilute sulphuric acid 
solution (e.g. butyraldehyde, Expt 5.74). To avoid further oxidation to the cor- 
responding acid, the aldehyde is removed as rapidly as possible by distillation 
through a fractionating column. The main by-product is an ester which arises as 
the result of the oxidation of an intermediately formed hemiacetal. 

R-CH 2 OH -^-&gt; R-CHO 
R-CH 2 OH + R-CHO ^=± R-CH 2 0-CH(OH)-R &gt; R-CH 2 0-CO-R 

Satisfactory yields of simple aldehydes are also usually obtained when the 
vapour of the primary alcohol is dehydrogenated by passage over a heated cata- 
lyst of copper-chromium oxide deposited on pumice (Expt 5.75). 

These rather vigorous conditions (high temperature and/or an aqueous 
strongly acidic environment) are however unsuitable for those primary alcohols 
which are insoluble in water, or owing to polyfunctionality, may be sensitive to 
acidic conditions. For these reasons several non-aqueous chromium(vi) 
oxidising reagents have been developed, including the Collins reagent 97 

[(C 5 H 5 N) 2 Cr0 3 ], pyridinium chlorochromate 98 [PCC, C 5 H 5 NH}C1-Cr0 3 ] 
and pyridinium dichromate 99 [PDC, (C 5 H 5 NH)f Cr 2 0? e ]. The latter two are 
currently the reagents of choice, particularly for the oxidation of a, ^-unsatur- 
ated primary and secondary alcohols to the corresponding unsaturated alde- 
hydes and ketones; their relative merits and cautionary notes in handling are 
discussed in Section 4.2.18, p. 425. The use of pyridinium chlorochromate is 
illustrated in the preparation of heptanal from heptan-1-ol (Expt 5.76). The 
varied use of these reagents is further illustrated in Expt 5.88 (PCC supported on 
alumina) 100 and in Section 5.10, p. 653) (PDC in the presence of activated 

587 



5.7 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



molecular sieves). 101 An alternative reagent for the oxidation of an alcohol to an 
aldehyde (or ketone) is periodinane, Section 6.3.5, p. 869. PCC oxidation of the 
alkylborane resulting from hydroboration of a terminal alkene with disiamyl- 
borane (Sia 2 BH) provides a useful alternative route to an aldehyde. 102

Since this hydroborating reagent is highly regioselective little of the alkyl methyl 
ketone (&lt;1%) is obtained. Furthermore with a non-conjugated diene having 
terminal and non-terminal carbon-carbon double bonds the terminal bonding 
system reacts preferentially giving finally an unsaturated aldehyde, e.g. limonene 
(4) to p-menth-l-en-9-al (5).

Experiment 5.74 BUTYRALDEHYDE (Butanal) 

Me(CH 2 ) 2 -CH 2 OH &gt; Me-(CH 2 ) 2 CHO 

Equip a two-necked 500 ml flask with a dropping funnel so that the outlet 
extends to the bottom of the flask, and a Hempel column (15 cm x 1.5 cm) 
(Fig. 2.105(c)) filled with 6-mm glass or porcelain rings, to which is attached a 
simple distillation head. Fit to the distillation head a thermometer and a con- 
denser set for downward distillation. Attach to the condenser outlet a receiver 
adapter and a flask immersed in a bath of crushed ice/water. Dissolve 56 g 
(0.188 mol) of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 300 ml of water and add 
cautiously, with stirring, 40 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. Place 41 g 
(51 ml, 0.55 mol) of butan-1-ol together with a few small chips of porous por- 
celain in the flask, heat the butan-1-ol to boiling and run in the dichromate 
solution via the dropping funnel during about 20 minutes. The oxidation to 
butyraldehyde proceeds with the evolution of heat, but it is necessary to con- 
tinue to heat the flask so that the mixture boils vigorously to maintain steady 
distillation. The temperature at the top of the column, however, should not 
exceed 80-85 °C. When all the oxidising agent has been added, continue heat- 
ing the mixture for 15 minutes and collect all that passes over below 90 °C. 
Separate the water from the distillate and dry the residue (29 g) for 30-60 
minutes with 3-4 g of anhydrous sodium sulphate. Meanwhile detach the

fractionating column from the apparatus and dry the glass or porcelain rings 
by washing with acetone and blowing hot air through them. Fit the column 
into a 100-ml flask and arrange for distillation as before. Distil the dried dis- 
tillate slowly (1-2 drops per second) through the column and collect as fairly 
pure butyraldehyde all that distils below 76 °C. The yield is 13 g (32%). Pure 
butyraldehyde boils at 74.5 °C. The i.r. spectrum reveals absorptions at 2700, 
2800 (0=C— H) and 1705 cm" 1 (C=0). Assign the p.m.r. absorptions 
which occur at (50.95 (t, 3H), 1.61 (m, 2H), 2.36 (d of t, 2H) and 9.68 (t, 1H). 
The m.s. shows principal fragment ions at m/z 72, 56, 44, 43, 41, 29. 

Cognate preparation. Propionaldehyde (propanal). Use 34 g (42.5 ml, 
0.567 mol) of propan-1-ol and a solution containing 56 g (0.188 mol) of 
sodium dichromate dihydrate, 300 ml of water and 40 ml of concentrated sul- 
phuric acid. The experimental details are identical with those for butyralde- 
hyde, except that the temperature at the top of the column is not allowed to 
rise above 70-75 °C, and during the subsequent heating for 15 minutes the 
liquid passing over below 80 °C is collected; the receiver must be cooled in ice. 
The yield of propionaldehyde, b.p. 47-50 °C, is 12 g (36%). 

Experiment 5.75 HEXANAL

Assemble the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2.65(c) with the catalyst of copper- 
chromium oxide deposited on pumice packed into the Pyrex combustion 
tube in sections of about 25 cm long, each being separated by a small plug of 
glass wool. Place lOOg (122ml, 0.98mol) of hexan-1-ol in the dropping 
funnel. The gas outlet from the Drechsel bottle, E, should be led into a fume 
cupboard or to an outside window, since hydrogen is evolved in the reaction. 
Place 0.1 g of hydroquinone in the receiver to act as a 'stabiliser' for the alde- 
hyde. Pass a gentle flow of nitrogen gas through the combusion tube and 
adjust the temperature of the furnace to 330 °C. After 2 hours, allow the alco- 
hol to pass into the combusion tube at the rate of 1 drop every 3-4 seconds. 
The commencement of the dehydrogenation will be indicated by the produc- 
tion of white fumes at the point where the combustion tube enters the con- 
denser; it will also be indicated by a gas flow (hydrogen) through the Drechsel 
bottles which continues after the nitrogen flow has been temporarily stopped. 
When all the hexanol has passed through the catalyst tube, remove the 
aqueous layer from the distillate, dry the organic layer with a little magne- 
sium sulphate and distil from a flask carrying a fractionating side arm. 
Collect the fraction (30 g) (1) having b.p. 125-135 °C, and redistil to obtain 
21 g (21%) of hexanal (2) having b.p. 127-129 °C. 

Notes. (1) If the high boiling residue is transferred to a smaller flask and frac- 
tionally distilled, some hexanol passes over first, followed by hexyl hexanoate 
(Me-(CH 2 ) 4 -C0 2 (CH 2 ) 5 -Me) (2g) at 240-250 °C (mainly at 245 °C). 
(2) About 0.1 per cent of hydroquinone should be added as a stabiliser since hexanal 
exhibits a marked tendency to polymerise. To obtain pure hexanal, treat the 21 g of 
the product with a solution of 42 g of sodium metabisulphite in 125 ml of water and 
shake; much bisulphite derivative will separate. Steam distil the suspension of the 
bisulphite complex until about 50 ml of distillate have been collected; this will remove 
any non-aldehyde impurities together with a little aldehyde. Cool the residual alde-

hyde-bisulphite solution to 40-50 °C, and add slowly a solution of 32 g of sodium 
hydrogen carbonate in 80 ml of water, and remove the free aldehyde by steam distilla- 
tion. Separate the upper layer of hexanal, wash it with a little water, dry with magne- 
sium sulphate and distil: the pure aldehyde passes over at 128-128.5 °C. 

Cognate preparations. Valeraldehyde (pentanal). Use 100g(123ml, 1.14mol) 
of pentan-1-ol, and fractionate the dried distillate. Collect the fraction of b.p. 
98-1 10 °C (23 g); upon redistillation 20 g (20%) of valeraldehyde, b.p. 101- 
105 °C, are obtained. From the high boiling fractions 25 g of pentan-1-ol (b.p. 
135-139 °C) may be recovered, together with 1.5 g of pentyl pentanoate (b.p. 
205-210 °C). 

Butyraldehyde (butanal). Use lOOg (123.5ml, 1.35 mol) of butan-1-ol. The 
yield of butyraldehyde, b.p. 70-75 °C, is 38 g (39%), and of butyl butanoate 
(b.p. 165-170 °C) is 2g; 40g of butan-1-ol are recovered. 

Propionaldehyde (propanal). Use 100 g (125 ml, 1.67 mol) of propan-1-ol and 
surround the receiver by a freezing mixture. The yield of propionaldehyde, 
b.p. 48-49.5 °C (mainly 49 °C), is 35 g (36%), and of propyl propanoate, b.p. 
120-125 °C, is 1 g; 30 g of propan-1-ol are recovered.

In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser is suspended 
pyridinium chlorochromate [PCC (Section 4.2.18, p. 425), 32.3 g, 150mmol] 
in 200ml of anhydrous dichloromethane. Heptan-1-ol (11.6 g, lOOmmol) in 
20 ml of dichloromethane is added in one portion to the magnetically stirred 
solution. After 1.5 hours, 200 ml of dry ether is added and the supernatant 
solution decanted from the black gum. The insoluble residue is washed thor- 
oughly with three 50-ml portions of anhydrous ether whereupon it becomes a 
black granular solid. The combined organic solutions are passed through a 
short pad of Florosil and the solvent removed by distillation. Distillation of 
the residual oil through a short Vigreux column gives 8.87 g (78%) of hepta- 
nal, b.p. 59-62 °C/30mmHg (1). 

Note. (1) These reaction conditions are used for the oxidation of decan-1-ol, hexane- 
1,6-diol and oct-2-yn-l-ol. In the case of alcohols where acid-sensitive groups are also 
present (e.g. tetrahydropyranyl ethers), sodium acetate is added to buffer the reaction 
mixture; alternatively pyridinium dichromate may be used." 

5.7.2 THE OXIDATIVE CLEAVAGE OF 1,2-DIOLS 

Cleavage of 1,2-diols using either lead tetra-acetate or sodium metaperiodate is 
a general reaction which has important preparative applications.

Cleavage of open-chain symmetrical diols, which must yield a single alde- 
hydic product, is clearly of most value. The preparation of butyl glyoxylate from 
dibutyl ( + )-tartrate (Expt 5.77) using lead tetra-acetate in benzene solution is 
an interesting example. A second example is the cleavage of the 1,2-diol system

glyceraldehyde (7) (Expt 5.77, cognate preparation). 104 The reaction is of inter- 
est in that the readily available, naturally occurring, optically active D-mannitol 
provides an effective starting material to prepare the protected (R)-glyceralde- 
hyde which is not easily obtained by other routes (e.g. by synthesis or by resolu- 
tion). The enantiomeric, similarly protected, (S)-glyceraldehyde has been 
prepared from the isopropylidene derivative (8) of the readily available ascorbic 
acid (Vitamin C), or its reduced form, by a similar oxidative sequence. 105

Periodic acid (or sodium metaperiodate) is often the reagent of choice when 
the substrate is soluble in an aqueous medium, as in the carbohydrate field; an 
example of its use is to be found in Expt 5.1 17. Sodium metaperiodate supported 
on silica gel (Section 4.2.55, p. 454) has been found to effectively oxidise water- 
insoluble a-diols, 10f&gt; and its value is illustrated in the preparation of hexanedial 
(Expt 5.78) from frans-cyclohexane-l,2-diol.

In view of the quantities of benzene (CAUTION) required, the entire prepara- 
tion must be carried out in the fume cupboard. Place a mixture of 125 ml of pure 
benzene and 32.5 g (0.123 mol) of dibutyl ( + )-tartrate (1) in a 500-ml three- 
necked flask, equipped with a Hershberg stirrer (Fig. 2.49) and a ther- 
mometer. Stir the mixture rapidly and add 58 g (0.13 mol) of lead tetra- 
acetate (Section 4.2.45, p. 441) in small portions over a period of 20 minutes 
while maintaining the temperature below 30 °C by occasional cooling with 
cold water. Continue the stirring for a further 60 minutes. Separate the salts 
by suction filtration and wash with two 25 ml portions of benzene. Remove 
the benzene and acetic acid from the filtrate by flash distillation and distil the 
residue under diminished pressure, preferably in a slow stream of nitrogen. 
Collect the butyl glyoxylate (2) at 66-69 °C/5 mmHg. The yield is 26g (81%). 

Notes. (1) The purified commercial dibutyl ( + )-tartrate, m.p. 22 °C, may be used. It 
may be prepared by using the procedure described under isopropyl lactate (Expt

necked flask equipped with a sealed stirrer, a double surface condenser and an auto- 
matic water separator (cf. Fig. 2.31(a)). Reflux the mixture w'th stirring for 10 hours:

bined filtrate and washings with two 75 ml portions of saturated sodium hydrogen 
carbonate solution, followed by 100 ml of water, and dry over magnesium sulphate. 
Remove the benzene by distillation under reduced pressure (water pump) and finally 
distil the residue. Collect the dibutyl ( + )-tartrate at 150°C/1.5mmHg. The yield is 
90g(69%). 

(2) Store the butyl glyoxylate under nitrogen; it undergoes autoxidation in air. The 
product decomposes on boiling (159-161 °C) at atmospheric pressure. 

Cognate preparation. (R)-2,3-0-Isopropylideneglyceraldehyde. To a solution 
of l,2:5,6-di-0-isopropylidene-D-mannitol (50 g, 0.19mol, Expt 5.114) in dry 
benzene (500 ml) (CAUTION) is slowly added lead tetra-acetate (90 g, 
0.2 mol) with stirring. After 3 hours the mixture is filtered, and the filtrate 
concentrated below 25 °C to a syrup from which four 30-ml portions of car- 
bon tetrachloride are evaporated at a temperature maintained below 25 °C. 
The syrup is distilled in vacuo. The first few millilitres are discarded and the 
main fraction is collected, 34 g (68%), b.p. 31 °C/5mmHg (1). 

Note. (1) The product is unstable on storage and changes are observed in the i.r. and 
p.m.r. spectra when it is kept at room temperature for several days.

frans-Cyclohexane-l,2-diol (232 mg, Expt 5.48) and sodium metaperiodate 
supported on silica gel (6.1 g, 10% loading. Section 4.2.55, p. 455) are stirred 
in dichloromethane (15 ml) (1) for 3 hours at 20 °C. The solids are then 
filtered off and washed with dichloromethane (2 x 10 ml). Evaporation of the 
solvent from the combined filtrate and washings gives a clear oil (185 mg, 
80%) which is pure dial. 

Note. (1) The dichloromethane is distilled from phosphorus pentoxide and stored 
over molecular sieves. 

5.7.3 THE 0Z0N0LYSIS OF SUITABLY SUBSTITUTED ALKENES 

Oxidation of alkenes with ozone followed by cleavage of the resulting ozonides 
to carbonyl compounds is widely used for the determination of structure of 
unsaturated compounds. The ozonolysis technique is described in detail in 
Section 2.17.4, p. 103. 

For preparative purposes the cleavage of the ozonide is best carried out by 
catalytic hydrogenation over palladium hydroxide-on-calcium carbonate, a 
catalyst system which does not hydrogenate the aldehydic products; the yield of 
the latter are usually fairly good. An alternative procedure for the decomposi- 
tion of the ozonide is treatment with dimethylsulphide in methanol; the use of 
the less obnoxious thiourea is a good alternative. 107 

Two examples of preparative ozonolysis are given (Expt 5.79). In the first 
cyclohexene is subjected to ozonolysis in ethyl acetate to provide a convenient 
synthesis of the a, co-dicarbonyl compound, adipaldehyde. In the second, the 

592 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.7 



substrate is oleic acid, which yields two aldehydic fragments, nonanal and aze- 
laic hemialdehyde. 

Me-(CH 2 ) 7 -CH=CH-(CH 2 ) 7 -C0 2 H ► 

Me-(CH 2 ) 7 -CHO + OCH-(CH 2 ) 7 -C0 2 H 

The solvent used in the latter case is dry ethyl chloride, which must be replaced 
by methanol before hydrogenation. Methanol when cooled to about — 20 °C is 
not attacked by ozone and can in many cases be used as the ozonisation solvent. 
In such cases the main product of addition of ozone to the alkene is not the usual 
ozonide, but is the methoxyhydroperoxide which, however, is also reductively 
cleaved to the aldehyde on hydrogenation. This ozonisation process may be 
mechanistically summarised as follows:

^ &amp; ^ G»°o 

Dissolve 8.2 g (0. 1 mol) of cyclohexene (Expt 5. 1 2) in 200 ml of pure dry ethyl 
acetate (Section 4.1.24, p. 409) contained in a 500-ml glass-stoppered wash 
bottle, cool the solution to —20 to — 30 °C or below (e.g. with solid carbon 
dioxide-acetone) and attach the wash bottle through a calcium chloride dry- 
ing tube to another containing acidified potassium iodide solution. Pass 
ozonised oxygen (CAUTION: see Section 2.17.4, p. 104) until the reaction is 
complete, i.e. until iodine is abundantly liberated. Then add 0.5 g of palla- 
dium hydroxide-calcium carbonate catalyst (Section 4.2.54, p. 453) (1) and 
hydrogenate the cold solution of the ozonide in the usual manner (see Section 
2.17.4, p. 106; cool the hydrogenation vessel in ice). Filter off the catalyst and 
remove the solvent by distillation at normal pressure. Distil the residue under 
reduced pressure and collect the adipaldehyde at 92-94 °C/12mmHg. The 
yield is 7g (61%). This aldehyde oxidises readily and should be kept in a 
sealed tube in an atmosphere of nitrogen or carbon dioxide. It may be con- 
verted into the dioxime by warming with aqueous hydroxylamine acetate 
solution: after recrystallisation from water, the dioxime has m.p. 172 °C. 

Cognate preparation. Azelaic hemialdehyde semicarbazone. Dissolve 7g 
(0.025 mol) of pure oleic acid in 30 ml of dry ethyl chloride (chloroform may 
be used but is less satisfactory), and ozonise at about — 30 °C. Remove the 

593 



5.7 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



bulk of the solvent under reduced pressure, dissolve the residue in 50 ml of 
dry methanol and hydrogenate as for adipaldehyde in the presence of 0.5 g of 
palladium-calcium carbonate (2). Warm the resulting solution for 30 minutes 
with a slight excess of semicarbazide acetate and pour into water. Collect the 
precipitated semicarbazones and dry: the yield is 8.5 g. Separate the mixture 
of semicarbazones by either of the following methods: (a) Treat with dilute 
sodium hydrogen carbonate solution to extract the semicarbazone of azelaic 
hemialdehyde; upon acidifying the extract with dilute sulphuric acid, the 
semicarbazone of azelaic hemialdehyde is precipitated (4.4 g, 77%, m.p. 
1 62 °C, after recrystallisation from methanol). The residue from the sodium 
hydrogen carbonate extraction consists of the semicarbazone of nonanal and 
melts at 101 °C after recrystallisation from methanol: yield 3.8 g (77%). 
(b) Extract the dry mixture of semicarbazones with ether: only the semi- 
carbazone of nonanal dissolves easily. 

Notes. (1) The Adams platinum oxide catalyst gives satisfactory results in the reduc- 
tion of ozonides. 

(2) An alternative work-up procedure after hydrogenation is to isolate the nonanal by 
steam distillation and to recover the azelaic hemialdehyde from the residual aqueous 
layer. 

5.7.4 THE REDUCTION OF NITRILES, CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND CARBOXYLIC ACID 
CHLORIDES 

The reduction of a nitrile is achieved with anhydrous tin(n) chloride dissolved in 
ether or ethyl acetate saturated with dry hydrogen chloride (the Stephen reac- 
tion). The resulting aldimine hydrochloride (probably in the form of a complex 
with tin(iv) chloride) is then hydrolysed with warm water. 

R-C=N + HC1 &gt; [R-C=NH]C1 -^-&gt; [R-CH=NH 2 ]C1 -^-&gt; R-CHO 

The Stephen reaction is used mainly for the synthesis of aromatic aldehydes but 
reduction of the higher aliphatic nitriles normally gives good yields. This 
method is illustrated by the synthesis of hexanal (Expt 5.80, Method A). Alterna- 
tive and convenient reagents for the controlled reduction of the cyano group to 
the imino group are diisobutylaluminium hydride (DIBAL) 108 and lithium 
triethoxyaluminohydride; 109 the use of the latter reagent is described in Expt 
5.80, Method B, where it is generated in situ from lithium aluminium hydride 
and ethyl acetate. 

A most convenient procedure for the conversion of carboxylic acids to alde- 
hydes results from their initial treatment with borane-dimethyl sulphide to give 
first, the triacyloxyborane (9), which is then reduced further to the intermediate 
(10); the trimer of (10) is the trialkyloxyboroxine (11). Oxidation of (11) with 
PCC then yields the aldehyde. 110 The method is illustrated for the preparation 
of octanal (Expt 5.81), but it has been applied to cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and 
to various aromatic carboxylic acids (X'C 6 HVC0 2 H, X = p-Cl, N0 2 , OMe, 
m-CN). 

The catalytic reduction of carboxylic acid chlorides by the Rosenmund pro- 
cedure may be used for the preparation of aliphatic aldehydes but its application 
is mainly for the synthesis of aromatic aldehydes (e.g. Expt 6.120). Alternative 
procedures for the chemical reduction of acid chlorides include reduction with

the former reagent.

Method A. Into a 500-ml three-necked flask, provided with a mechanical 
stirrer, a gas inlet tube and a reflux condenser, place 57 g of anhydrous tin(n) 
chloride {Section 4.2. 73, p. 465) and 200 ml of anhydrous ether. Pass in dry 
hydrogen chloride gas (Section 4.2.38, p. 438) until the mixture is saturated 
and separates into two layers; the lower viscous layer consists of tin(n) chlor- 
ide dissolved in ethereal hydrogen chloride. Set the stirrer in motion and add 
19.4g (0.2 mol) of hexanenitrile (Expt 5.160) through the separatory funnel. 
Separation of the crystalline aldimine hydrochloride commences after a few 
minutes; continue the stirring for 15 minutes. Filter off the crystalline solid, 
suspend it in about 50 ml of water and heat under reflux until it is completely 
hydrolysed. Allow to cool and extract with ether; dry the ethereal extract with 
anhydrous calcium sulphate or magnesium sulphate and remove the ether 
slowly by distillation through a short fractionating column. Finally, distil the 
residue and collect the hexanal at 127-129 °C. The yield is 19 g (95%). 

Method B. 104 In a 1 -litre flask equipped with a condenser, a thermometer 
and a dropping funnel is placed 0.3 mol of lithium aluminium hydride 
(CAUTION, see Section 4.2.49, p. 445) in dry ether (300 ml). A nitrogen 
atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction. To this stirred solution 
0.45 mol of ethyl acetate is added over a period of 75 minutes maintaining the 
temperature at 3-7 °C. The reaction is stirred for an additional 30 minutes. 
To this solution at — 10 °C is added 29.1 g (0.3 mol) of hexanenitrile in 5 
minutes. The reaction temperature rises to 12°C in 10 minutes with the 
formation of a viscous solution. It is allowed to stir for another 50 minutes at 
3 °C. The reaction mixture is decomposed by the addition of 300 ml of 2.5 m 
sulphuric acid. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted 
with ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with sodium hydrogen 
carbonate solution and water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate (1).

Trioctyloxyboroxine. In a dry 250-ml round-bottomed flask provided with a 
septum inlet, magnetic stirrer bar, and a reflux condenser attached to a con- 
necting tube leading to a mercury bubbler, are placed octanoic acid (9.51 ml, 
60mmol) and diethyl ether (75 ml) under nitrogen. The mixture is stirred 
vigorously and borane-dimethyl sulphide (BMS, 6.12 ml, 60mmol) is added 
dropwise from a syringe. Following the addition of the initial 2-3 ml of BMS, 
when gas evolution has ceased, the mixture is heated under gentle reflux to 
complete evolution of gas (hydrogen). The remainder of the BMS is added at 
such a rate as to maintain gentle reflux. Following completion of the addi- 
tion, the mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. The solvent and dimethyl 
sulphide (CAUTION) are removed under vacuum (1) and dichloromethane 
(20 ml) is introduced to dissolve the product. 

Octanal. To a well-stirred suspension of pyridinium chlorochromate [PCC 
(Section 4.2.75, p. 426), 14.3 g, 66mmol] in dichloromethane (100 ml) con- 
tained in a 500-ml flask equipped as above, is added dropwise the above solu- 
tion of trioctyloxyboroxine in dichloromethane. The stirred mixture is heated 
under reflux for 1 hour and then diluted with ether (150 ml). The supernatant 
liquid is filtered through Florosil (lOOg) contained in a 300-ml sintered glass 
funnel; the solid residue is triturated with ether (3 x 50 ml) and passed 
through the same Florosil column. The colourless filtrate is concentrated and 
distilled under reduced pressure to give octanal: yield 5.9 g (77%), b.p. 64- 
65°C/15mmHg. 

Note. (1) Very efficient cooling traps must be used in this distillation, and Section 
4.2.7, p. 419 should be consulted for the treatment and disposal of the distillate and 
| trap residues. 

5.7.5 METHODS BASED UPON ALKYL HALIDES 

The disconnection strategies summarised on p. 586 reveal that the nucleophilic 
organometallic reagents derived from alkyl halides (e.g. R-MgX, RLi) require 

® 
reagents equivalent to the formyl cation (H-C=0), whereas the electrophilic 

e 
halides themselves require reagents equivalent to acyl anion (H-C=0). 

596 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.7 



The reagent equivalents of the acceptor formyl synthon are a formate ester 
(e.g. H-COOEt), a trialkyl orthoformate (e.g. H-C(OR) 3 ), or the Vilsmeier 
reagent (see Section 6.10.1, p. 991). Although the addition of a Grignard reagent 
to a formate ester yields an aldehyde, further addition of the reagent to the more 
reactive aldehydic carbonyl-carbon results in the formation of a secondary alco- 
hol (cf. synthesis of secondary alcohols, Section 5.4.2, p. 537). However, the reac- 
tion may be stopped at the aldehyde stage by an inverse addition procedure. 
More conveniently, the formation of a secondary alcohol may be prevented by 
using triethyl orthoformate in a reaction with a Grignard reagent, when the 
product is an acetal which is less reactive towards the organometallic com- 
pound. The acetal is a protected carbonyl group which may be revealed by 
hydrolysis with hot aqueous sulphuric acid. The reaction is illustrated by the 
preparation of hexanal (Expt 5.82). 

R-MgX + HC(OEt) 3 y R-CH(OEt) 2 + Mg(OEt)X 

The Grignard reaction has been improved by the use of phenyl diethyl ortho- 
formate, which may be prepared by an ester exchange reaction between equi- 
molar amounts of triethyl orthoformate and phenol. ! ! 3 

One of the most important reagent equivalents of the donor formyl synthon is 
1,3-dithiane (see Chapter 1, p. 21). However the use of this reagent equivalent is 
not widely found for the synthesis of simple aldehydes since other methods may 
be economically more appropriate. An example of specific formylation by the 
use of 1,3-dithiane is illustrated in Expt 6.66. Disodium tetracarbonylferrate(n) 

20 

is a synthetic equivalent of the carbon monoxide dianion (C=0), and as well 
as being used as a reagent for aldehyde synthesis it is also of value for the syn- 
thesis of ketones, esters, amides and carboxylic acids. 1 14 The toxicity and hazar- 
dous nature of the reagent however is such that only the most experienced 
synthetic chemists should attempt to use it. 115

In a suitably equipped 1 -litre three-necked flask prepare a Grignard reagent 
from 15 g (0.675 mol) of dry magnesium turnings, 225 ml of sodium-dried

plete, cool the flask to about 5°C and add 74 g (83 ml, 0.5 mol) of triethyl

cent hydrochloric acid with stirring; keep the contents of the flask cool by the 
occasional addition of a little crushed ice. When all the white solid has passed 
into solution, transfer to a separatory funnel and remove the upper layer of 
hexanal diacetal. Hydrolyse the acetal by distilling it with a solution of 50 g 
(27.5 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in 350 ml of water; collect the alde- 
hyde, which distils over as an oil, in a solution of 50 g of sodium meta- 
bisulphite in 150 ml of water. Remove the oily layer (largely pentan-1-ol)

insoluble in the bisulphite solution and discard it. Steam distil the bisulphite 
solution until 100 ml of the distillate have been collected: this will separate the 
remainder of the pentan-1-ol and other impurities. Cool the residual bi- 
sulphite solution to about 45 °C, cautiously add a suspension of 40 g of 
sodium hydrogen carbonate in 100 ml of water and separate the resulting free 
aldehyde by steam distillation. Remove the upper layer (crude aldehyde) of 
the distillate, wash it with three 25 ml portions of water and dry it with 10 g of 
calcium sulphate or magnesium sulphate. Distil through a short fractionating 
column, and collect the hexanal at 127-129 °C. The yield is 25 g (50%). 



5.7.6. THE HYDROLYSIS AND DECARBOXYLATION OF a.£-EP0XY ESTERS (GLYCIDIC 
ESTERS 

Glycidic esters are prepared by the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with an a- 
haloester in the presence of base (sodium ethoxide, sodamide, finely divided 
sodium or potassium t-butoxide) (the Darzens glycidic ester condensation).

The use of ethyl chloroacetate as the starting ester results in the formation of 
aldehydes, as in the preparation of 2-phenylpropanal (Expt 5.83), whereas 
ketones are obtained using homologous ethyl a-chloroesters. A special pro- 
cedure for the hydrolysis of a glycidic ester is used in Expt 5.83. This involves 
treatment of the ester with one equivalent of sodium ethoxide in absolute 
ethanol followed by the addition of one equivalent of water when precipitation 
of the sodium salt of the glycidic acid occurs; the precipitation of the sodium 
salts of glycidic acids is frequently facilitated by the addition of ether. With 
aqueous alkali the glycidic ester is hydrolysed to the corresponding epoxy acid 
which decarboxylates under acidic conditions to give a carbonyl compound.

A two-phase solid-liquid transfer catalytic system has been developed for 
aromatic aldehydes and for aliphatic aldehydes which are branched at the a- 
carbon. 1 16 The aldehyde and the a-chloroester are stirred in dimethylformamide 
in the presence of solid potassium carbonate and triethylbenzylammonium 
chloride. The isolated yield of glycidic ester compares favourably with that of 
the procedure above.

Ethyl 3-phenyl-2,3-epoxybutanoate. In a 500-ml three-necked flask, fitted 
with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer, place a mixture of 60 g (58.5 ml, 
0.5 mol) of acetophenone, 61.5 g (53 mol, 0.5 ml) of ethyl chloroacetate (b.p. 
142-143 °C) and 100ml of sodium-dried benzene. Add, with stirring 23.6g 
(0.6 mol) of finely powdered sodamide (Section 4.2.67, p. 462) over a period of 
2 hours; maintain the temperature at 15-20°C with the aid of external cool- 
ing. Ammonia is evolved. Stir for 2 hours at room temperature and pour the 
reddish mixture on to 350 g of crushed ice with hand stirring. Separate the 
organic layer and extract the aqueous layer with 100 ml of benzene. Wash the 
combined benzene solutions with three 150 ml portions of water, the last one 
containing 5 ml of acetic acid, and then dry with magnesium sulphate. After 
removal of the benzene on a rotary evaporator, distil the residue under 
reduced pressure through a short fractionating column. Collect the fraction 
of b.p. 1 1 1-1 14 °C/3 mmHg as the glycidic ester; the yield is 67 g (65%). 

2-Phenylpropanal (hydratropaldehyde). Prepare a solution of sodium 
ethoxide in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask from 7.6 g (0.33 mol) of clean 
sodium and 150 ml of absolute ethanol (for experimental details see Expt 
5.95). Add 66.5 g of the above glycidic ester slowly and with shaking. Cool the 
flask externally to 15 °C and add 6 ml of water slowly; much heat is evolved 
and the sodium salt soon separates. Keep the reaction mixture overnight. 
Collect the salt by suction filtration, wash it with 25 ml of ethanol followed by 
25 ml of ether. 

Add the salt to dilute hydrochloric acid (prepared from 28 ml of the con- 
centrated acid and 1 50 ml of water) contained in a 500-ml flask fitted with a 
reflux condenser. Warm the mixture gently; carbon dioxide is evolved and an 
oil separates. Heat on a steam bath for 90 minutes, cool and extract the oil 
with 75 ml of benzene. Wash the extract with 100 ml of water, and distil the 
benzene solution under reduced pressure. Collect the 2-phenylpropanal at 
90-93 °C/10 mmHg; the yield is 30g (70%). 

Cognate preparation. Ethyl 2,l'-epoxycyclohexylacetate. Add a mixture of 
55 g (48 ml, 0.45 mol) of ethyl chloroacetate and 43 g (0.44 mol) of cyclo- 
hexanone dropwise to a suspension of finely divided sodium (1 1 g, 0.48 mol) 
in anhydrous xylene (165 ml) (Section 4.1.4, p. 399) with stirring and cooling 
in an ice-salt bath. Regulate the rate of addition so that the temperature of 
the reaction mixture does not exceed 8 °C. Pour the resulting dark-red clear 
solution into water, wash the organic layer repeatedly with water, dry with 
magnesium sulphate and distil. Collect the glycidic ester at 81-83 °C/ 
0.04 mmHg or at 115-117 °C/10mmHg. The yield is 37g (46%). 

5.7.7 THE OXIDATIVE HYDROLYSIS OF NITRONATE SALTS DERIVED FROM PRIMARY 
NITROALKANES 

The hydrolysis of the conjugate base of a primary nitroalkane to an aldehyde 
under acidic conditions is known as the Nef reaction (cf. Section 5.8.7, p. 623).

However the acidic conditions often results in by-product formation which 
lowers the yield of aldehyde. Alternative procedures include the oxidation of the 
nitronate salt with potassium permanganate, 117 the oxidative cleavage of the 
carbon-nitrogen bond by ozonolysis, 118 or the reduction of the nitroalkane to 
the imine with titanium(m) chloride followed by hydrolysis to the aldehyde 119 
(cf. Stephen reaction). The example given in Expt 5.84 for the preparation of 
octanal involves the conversion of 1-nitrooctane into its conjugate base with 
sodium hydride, followed by oxidation with potassium permanganate. Because 
of the susceptibility to further oxidation of the aldehydic product, the reaction is 
carried out under nitrogen, and a layer of pentane is placed over the aqueous 
phase into which the aldehyde is extracted as soon as it is formed. 

The usefulness of the nitronate anion from a primary nitroalkane as an acyl 
anion equivalent (see Appendix A6.2) is further illustrated by the fact that it may 
be reacted with other electrophiles, prior to the conversion into the carbonyl 
group. 120 An example of its use in this manner is illustrated in Expt 5.178.

A 60 per cent oil suspension of sodium hydride (160 mg, 4mmol) is washed 
free of oil with pentane and transferred to a nitrogen-filled flask with the aid 
of 20 ml of t-butyl alcohol. After stirring this mixture for 10 minutes, a solu- 
tion of 1-nitrooctane (318mg, 2mmol) in 40 ml of t-butyl alcohol is added all 
at once; a heavy white precipitate formed immediately. The mixture is stirred 
for 20 minutes and then 600 ml of ice-cold pentane is added; this was followed 
at once by 50 g of ice and an ice-cold solution of 316mg (2mmol) of potas- 
sium permanganate and 248 mg (4 mmol) of boric acid in 80 ml of water. The 
mixture is stirred vigorously under nitrogen for 10 minutes and then 2 ml of 
aqueous 1 m sodium metabisulphite and 4 ml of 1 m sulphuric acid are added. 
The pentane layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice 
with 60-ml portions of pentane. The combined pentane solutions are washed 
three times with 400-ml portions of ice-cold water and dried over magnesium 
sulphate under nitrogen. Removal of the pentane under vacuum gives 249 mg 
(97%) of crude aldehyde; 240 mg of this oil is dissolved in c. 2 ml of pentane 
and filtered through a 3 cm x 2.5 cm column of deactivated silica gel (1) and 
the column eluted with pentane. Removal of the pentane gives 215 mg (89%) 
of a very pale yellow oil. Spectra (n.m.r. and i.r.) show the oil to be pure 
octanal.

tered, air-dried, and then oven-dried at 120°C for 12 hours. 

5.7.8 METHODS FOR THE ALKYLATION OF THE CARBON CHAIN 

Although a retrosynthetic disconnection of an a-branched aldehyde to give an 
alkyl group and a mesomerically stabilised a-carbanion suggests a synthesis 
based on this strategy, in practice it is not feasible. This is because the a- 

600 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.7 



carbanion, generated from the aldehyde by base, rapidly undergoes a self-aldol 
condensation (Section 5.18.2, p. 799) and this normally precludes any successful 
alkylation reaction. 




R'-CH(R 2 )-CHO ^¥- R'-CH^-Cf &gt; R'CHj-CHCOHJ-CHCR'J-CHO 



a-Alkylation of the carbon chain is however possible if the carbonyl group is 
first converted into either the imine (12) (Section 5.16.5, p. 782), or the hydra- 
zone (13). 121 Subsequently these nitrogen derivatives are converted into the 
corresponding lithio derivatives (which do not undergo self-condensation) by 
treatment with lithium diisopropylamide, and may then be alkylated by reaction 
with an alkyl halide.

However for the formation of optically active a-alkyl aldehydes, the imine or 
hydrazone routes have proved of considerable value. 122 In the preparative 
example 123 the aldehydes propanal and octanal are converted with (S)-( — )-2- 
amino-l-methoxy-3-phenylpropane (14) into the imines (15) and (16) respect- 
ively. Treatment with lithium diisopropylamide then yields the corresponding 
lithioenamines [only the (£)-isomers are formulated, since the (Z)-isomers 
would be less stable]. These intermediates have a topography which determines 
the subsequent direction of attack by the alkyl halide (see also Section 5.11.7, 
p. 688). In the formulation below, this stereoselection is from above the plane of 
the paper and leads to the (/?)- and (S)-2-methyloctanals respectively.

(S)-Phenylalanine ethyl ester hydrochloride. ' 24 To a stirred, ice-cold suspen- 
sion of (S) -phenylalanine (30 g, O.182mol) in absolute ethanol (800 ml), thio- 
nyl chloride (32.5 g, 0.273 mol) is added dropwise, and the reaction mixture is 
then heated under reflux for 3.5 hours. The pale yellow solution is allowed to 
stand at room temperature overnight, and then the ethanol is evaporated in 
vacuo to leave colourless crystals of the hydrochloride which are stirred with 
dry ether, filtered off and dried in vacuo. 

(S)-2-Amino-3-phenylpropan-l-oI \_(S)-phenylalaninol~\. 124 To a solution of 
sodium borohydride (3.5 g, 0.092 mol) in 50 per cent aqueous ethanol (50 ml) 
is added dropwise a solution of (S)-phenylalanine ethyl ester hydrochloride 
(5.0 g, 0.022 mol) in 50 per cent aqueous ethanol (50 ml). After the resulting 
mixture is refluxed for 4.5 hours, ethanol is evaporated in vacuo. The aqueous 
solution thus obtained is then extracted with ethyl acetate and the extract 
washed with saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous 
sodium sulphate. Evaporation of the ethyl acetate under reduced pressure 
affords (S)-phenylalaninol (2.8 g, 84%) as a pale yellow solid m.p. 85-92 °C. 
Recrystallisation from ether gives colourless crystals of m.p. 91-93 °C, 
[oe]£ 5 - 25.6° (c. 1.037 in EtOH).

(S)-(— )-2-Amino-l-methoxy-3-phenylpropane. A solution of (S)-phenyl- 
alaninol (18.4g, 0.122mol) in 250 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added 
dropwise to a stirred suspension of potassium hydride (5.23 g, 0.130mol, pen- 
tane washed) in 100 ml of tetrahydrofuran at 25 °C under nitrogen. The 
resulting pale yellow gelatinous mixture is allowed to stand overnight and 
then a solution of methyl iodide (17.0g, 0.119mol, CAUTION) in 150 ml of 
tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise over 2 hours. Mixing is accomplished by 
external shaking since the gelatinous mixture would not stir with a magnetic 
stirrer bar. The reaction components are then allowed to mix for an addi- 
tional 3 hours and then poured into 1 litre of cold saturated brine, extracted 
thrice with ether, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and concentrated to 
give 24.9 g of crude product. Distillation gives 17.1 g, b.p. 55-59 °C/ 
0.1 mmHg, of a clear oil which on standing becomes cloudly and rapidly pro- 
duces a white precipitate which is found to be the carbonate. Since this ex- 
periment was performed it has been found that conversion of the freshly 
distilled methoxyamine to its hydrochloride salt is a more convenient way to 
store the compound. Thus the methoxyamine (17.0g) immediately after dis- 
tillation is dissolved in 700 ml of absolute ethanol and dry hydrogen chloride 
bubbled in for 10 minutes. The resulting solution is concentrated in vacuo to 
furnish 20.5 g of a colourless solid which is recrystallised from ethanol-ether 
(13:1), m.p. 151-152 °C, [a]i? 8 + 19.7° (a 2.5 in EtOH), 5 (D 2 0) 2.90 (d, 2H), 
3.34 (s, 3H), 3.54 (s, 2H), 3.59 (m, 1H), and 7.37 (broad s, 5H). To release the 
free methoxyamine, it is dissolved in 5 per cent potassium carbonate solution 
and extracted with ether, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concen- 
trated. Bulb-to-bulb distillation at 52°C/0.1mmHg gives a clear oil, [oe]^ 
-14.7° (c. 6 in C 6 H 6 ); p.m.r. (CDC1 3 ) 51.75 (broad s, 2H, disappears on 
D 2 shake) 2.68 (m, 2H), 3.35 (broads, 6H) and 7.24 (s, 5H). 

Formation of aldimines from propanal and octanal. To a stirred solution 
(0°C) of lOmmol of the methoxyamine dissolved in 30 ml of benzene 
(CAUTION) (previously washed with concentrated sulphuric acid and dis- 
tilled) is added lOmmol of the pure aldehyde. An immediate cloudiness 
usually results. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and 
c. 15 g of anhydrous sodium sulphate added. After stirring an additional 30- 
40 minutes, it is filtered and the sodium sulphate washed thoroughly with dry 
ether. The solvent is removed first with aspirator pressure and then with a 
vacuum pump (0.5 mm) to generally furnish 9.5-10 mmol of the aldimine as a 
colourless oil. The aldimines are dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (0.4 m) and 
stored at —20 to — 30 °C. Attempts to store the aldimines as neat liquids 
result in deterioration. The solutions of aldimines are conveniently trans- 
ferred via a syringe to reaction vessels. 

(/?)- and (5)-2-MethyIoctanaI. (The editors suggest that the apparatus set-up 
shown in Fig. 2.77 could be used.) The flask is charged with 10 ml of anhyd- 
rous tetrahydrofuran under a nitrogen atmosphere. Freshly distilled di- 
isopropylamine (1.54 ml, 11 mmol) is added via a syringe and the solution 
cooled to °C. Butyllithium (4.6 ml of a 2.4 m solution in hexane) is added 
and the solution stirred at °C for 40 minutes and then cooled to — 23 °C 
(dry ice-carbon tetrachloride). The aldimine (lOmmol) in 25ml of tetra- 
hydrofuran is added via a syringe over 5 minutes. The resulting solution 
(generally yellow) is stirred at — 23 °C for 30 minutes and then cooled to 

603 



5.8 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



— 78 °C (dry ice-propanol). The alkyl halide (hexyl or methyl iodide) 
(10 mmol) dissolved in 5 ml of tetrahydrofuran is then added and the reaction 
mixture stirred for 2-7 hours at —78 °C (1). After warming to room temper- 
ature and addition of 50 ml of ether, the cloudy mixture is poured into 100 ml 
of water and the phases separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with ether 
and the combined organic phases are washed with brine, dried over 
anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated. The crude alkylated aldimines 
are hydrolysed by dissolving in 30 ml of pentane and shaking for 5 minutes in 
a separating funnel with an aqueous acetic acid-sodium acetate solution (pre- 
pared from 37.5 ml of acetic acid, 37.5 ml of water and 16.2g of sodium 
acetate). The layers are separated and the aqueous layer extracted once with 
30 ml of pentane. Both layers are kept (2). The combined pentane layers are 
washed successively with water, 10 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate, 
water and then dried. Evaporation of the filtered pentane solution gives the 
crude aldehyde as a pale yellow oil. Bulb-to-bulb distillation at 90 °C/ 
4mmHg furnishes a clear colourless product which by g.l.c. analysis is shown 
to be 70-75 per cent pure 2-methyloctanal. The contaminant in the case of the 
reaction between the aldimine of propanal and hexyl iodide, is hexyl iodide, 
and in the case of the reaction between the aldimine of octanal and methyl 
iodide, is octanal. These impurities arise from an incomplete metallation reac- 
tion which leads in the first instance to generation of propanal and hexyl 
iodide in the work-up procedure, and in the second instance to the generation 
of octanal and methyl iodide. In the final bulb-to-bulb distillation the more 
volatile propanal or methyl iodide is removed from the respective 2-methyl- 
octanal distillates, leaving the contaminants noted above (3). 

Notes. (1) The reaction is monitored by withdrawing a 0.5 ml aliquot, quenching with 
water, and n.m.r. analysis of the extracted organic residue. 

(2) The chiral methoxyamine is recovered from the aqueous solution by neutralisation 
with solid potassium hydroxide and extraction with ether. The ethereal extract is 
washed with brine, dried over potassium carbonate and concentrated to give the 
crude chiral amine in 80-88 per cent yield. Distillation affords the pure amine (70- 
75% recovery) with [a] values which indicate that no racemisation has occurred. 

(3) The literature authors prepared mixtures of enantiomerically pure 2-methyl- 
octanal ([a] D 2 5 -8.90 °C) (isolated by preparative g.l.c. from the sample prepared by the 
above procedure from the aldimine of propanal and hexyl iodide) containing w/w 
amounts of 12.7, 25.7 and 44.6 per cent of hexyl iodide. The [a] D values of these mix- 
tures were plotted against the weight per cent to give a linear relationship. The g.l.c. 
composition of the reaction product and its extrapolated specific rotation thus 
allowed an ee per cent value to be calculated. In a similar way the ee per cent of the 
reaction of the aldimine of octanal and methyl iodide was calculated from the mix- 
tures of octanal with the optically pure 2-methyloctanal of 55.4, 74.3 and 87.3 per cent 
and the plot weight per cent v. [a] D was again linear. 



5.8 ALIPHATIC KETONES 

Ketones may have symmetrical (R-COR) or unsymmetrical R^COR 2 ) struc- 
tures. Branching in either of the alkyl groups or the presence of a functional 
group substituent is located by systematic numbering of the carbon chain; letters 
of the Greek alphabet may be used to locate positions relative to the carbonyl 
carbon atom. Illustrative representations are shown for:

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.8 



SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The presence of a carbonyl group in a compound is readily recognised by its 
strong characteristic i.r. absorption at c. 1700 cm" 1 (Fig. 3.28, 4-methylpentan- 
2-one). Ketones may be definitively distinguished from other carbonyl contain- 
ing compounds [RCHO, RC0 2 H, (RCO) 2 0, R-C0 2 R, R-CONH 2 ] by the ab- 
sence of absorption arising from groups associated with the carbonyl carbon 
(p. 296). The p.m.r. spectrum is of great value for the assignment of structure to 
the alkyl or aralkyl groups since the carbonyl group exerts a deshielding effect 
on the a-hydrogens, and to a lesser extent the /^-hydrogens, resulting in differ- 
ences in chemical shift values. Often the multiplicity of the signals of these 
groups of protons may be interpreted by first order analysis (p. 341). The 
fragmentation observed in the m.s. is discussed in detail on p. 377 (Fig. 3.84, 
4-methylpentan-2-one). Further examples illustrating all these spectroscopic 
characteristics are descriptively analysed in some of the preparative examples 
below. The u.v.-visible absorption spectrum of saturated aliphatic and alicyclic 
ketones is of little structural value (CO, A max c. 240 nm, e50). However with 
chiral acyclic and cyclic ketones the optical rotatory dispersion curves are often 
of great value in the assignment of configurational and conformational features 
(p. 248). 

5.8.1 THE OXIDATION OF SECONDARY ALCOHOLS 

The oxidation of secondary alcohols with sodium dichromate in dilute sulphuric 
acid gives acceptable yields of ketones since these do not normally undergo ex- 
tensive further oxidation under the reaction conditions (cf. Section 5.7.1, p. 587, 
the oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes). 

3R 2 CHOH + Cr 2 2e + 3S0 29 &gt; 3R 2 CO + Cr 2 (S0 4 ) 3 + 7H 2 

An excellent method for the conversion of ether-soluble secondary alcohols to 
the corresponding ketones is by chromic acid oxidation in a two-phase ether- 
water system. The reaction is carried out at 25-30 °C with the stoichiometric 
quantity of chromic acid calculated on the basis of the above equation, and is 
exemplified by the preparation of octan-2-one and cyclohexanone (Expt 5.86). 
The success of this procedure is evidently due to the rapid formation of the 
chromate ester of the alcohol, which is then extracted into the aqueous phase, 
followed by formation of the ketone which is then extracted back into the ether 
phase and is thus protected from undesirable side reactions. 

A slightly modified procedure - oxidation with 100 per cent excess of chromic 
acid at °C for a short period - is adopted for strained bicyclic alcohols (e.g. the 
oxidation of ( — )-borneol to ( — )-camphor, Expt 5.87) and gives excellent yields 
of the corresponding ketones. Cycle ketones which are susceptible to acid-cata- 
lysed epimerisation are moreover obtained by this procedure in a high degree of 
epimeric purity. 

The use of pyridinium-based chromium(vi) oxidising agents (cf. Section 5.7.1, 
p. 587) is illustrated by the use of the supported reagent, pyridinium 
chlorochromate-alumina, for the conversion of the cyclic allylic alcohol, carveol, 
into the corresponding a, ^-unsaturated ketone, carvone 125 (Expt 5.88). 

The conversion of an alkene into the corresponding ketone may be effected 
by means of a convenient sequence which involves hydroboration followed by 
oxidation with chromic acid of the resulting organoborane (cf. Section 5.4.3, 

607 



5.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



p. 542); isomeric purity is dependent upon the regiospecificity of the hydro- 
boration step. The sequence is illustrated by the conversion of 1-methyl- 
cyclohexene into 2-methylcyclohexanone (Expt 5.89). 

Secondary alcohols may be oxidised to the corresponding ketones by the use 
of an aluminium alkoxide, frequently the t-butoxide, in the presence of a large 
excess of acetone (the Oppenauer oxidation). The reaction involves an initial 
alkoxy-exchange process followed by a hydride ion transfer from the so-formed 
aluminium alkoxide of the secondary alcohol by a mechanism analogous to that 
of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reduction (see Section 5.4.1, p. 520).

Acetone in conjunction with benzene as a solvent is widely employed. Altern- 
atively cyclohexanone as the hydrogen acceptor, coupled with toluene or xylene 
as solvent, permits the use of higher reaction temperatures and consequently the 
reaction time is considerably reduced; the excess of cyclohexanone can be easily 
separated from the reaction product by steam distillation. Usually at least 
0.25 mol of aluminium alkoxide per mol of secondary alcohol is employed. 
However, since an excess of alkoxide has no detrimental effect, the use of 1 to 
3 mol of alkoxide is desirable, particularly as water, either present in the reagents 
or formed during secondary reactions, will remove an equivalent quantity of the 
reagent. It is recommended that 50 to 200 mol of acetone or 10 to 20 mol of 
cyclohexanone be employed. Other oxidisable groups are usually unaffected in 
the Oppenauer oxidation and the reaction has found wide application in the 
steroid field. 

The reaction is illustrated by the oxidation of cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3- 
one (Expt 5.90); the migration of the double bond from the ft, y- to the a, im- 
position is a commonly occurring side reaction associated with unsaturated ster- 
oids of this structural type. 

The oxidation of primary or secondary alcohols to aldehydes or ketones 
respectively with dimethyl sulphoxide activated by oxalyl chloride has wide 
applicability (Swern oxidation). 243b The initial reaction between the acid chlor- 
ide and dimethyl sulphoxide in dichloromethane solvent is vigorous and exo- 
thermic at — 60 °C and results in the formation of the complex (7); this complex 
spontaneously decomposes, even at this low temperature, releasing carbon 
dioxide and carbon monoxide to form the complex (8). The alcohol is added 
within 5 minutes, followed after 1 5 minutes by triethylamine. After a further 5 
minutes at low temperature the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room 
temperature and work-up follows standard procedures. The ratio of reactants is 
dimethyl sulphoxide : oxalyl chloride : alcohol : triethylamine 2.2:1.1:1.0:5.

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer 
and a two-way adapter carrying a dropping funnel and condenser; arrange 
for the occasional cooling of the flask in an ice-water bath. Place a solution of 
32.5 g (0.25 mol) of octan-2-ol in 100 ml of ether in the flask and 125 ml 
(0.083 mol) of chromic acid solution (1) in the dropping funnel. Add the chro- 
mic acid solution dropwise during 15 minutes to the vigorously stirred ether 
solution of the ketone, keeping the temperature between 25 and 30 °C by 
cooling as necessary. Continue stirring at room temperature for a further 2 
hours and then transfer the reaction mixture to a separating funnel. Separate 
the ether layer and extract the dark green aqueous layer with four 60 ml por- 
tions of ether. Combine the ether extracts and wash with 40 ml of saturated 
sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and then with 40 ml of saturated 
sodium chloride solution; finally dry the ether extract over anhydrous sodium 
sulphate. Filter, remove the ether on a rotary evaporator and distil the resi- 
due at atmospheric pressure. Collect the octan-2-one (2) at 170-172 °C. The 
yield is 26 g (81%). The purity may be checked by g.l.c. using a 1.5-m, 10 per 
cent Silicone oil column at 110°C and with a nitrogen flow rate of 40 ml/ 
minute. The ketone has a retention time of 3.1 minutes. 

Notes. (1) The chromic acid solution may be prepared as follows. Dissolve lOOg 
(0.33 mol) of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 300 ml of water and slowly add 134g

CAUTION: This experiment should be carried out in a fume cupboard. 

Equip a 250-ml three-necked round-bottomed flask with a thermometer, a 
reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride guard-tube and (in the cen- 
tral neck) a 100-ml pressure-equalising dropping funnel fitted with an inlet 
adapter to allow flushing with a stream of dry nitrogen. The apparatus 
should be thoroughly dried in an oven and assembled under a stream of dry 
nitrogen. Adjust the nitrogen flow to a slight trickle, which should be main- 
tained throughout the reaction, and in the flask place a magnetic follower 
bar, 30ml of dry ether, 4.8g (0.050mol) of 1-methylcyclohexene (Expt 5.12) 
and 0.5 g (0.0225 mol, 20% excess) of lithium borohydride (1). In the dropping 
funnel place 5 ml of dry ether and 0.95 ml (0.075 mol, 20% excess) of purified 
boron trifluoride-etherate (Section 4.2.8, p. 421). Add the boron trifluoride- 
etherate solution to the stirred mixture dropwise during 15 minutes, keeping 
the temperature at 25-30 °C by cooling in a water bath. Stir for 2 hours at 
room temperature and then destroy excess hydride by adding carefully 5 ml

the chromic acid solution portionwise to the reaction mixture during 15 
minutes while maintaining the temperature at 25-30 °C by cooling in an ice- 
water bath. Heat the dark mixture under reflux for 2 hours, cool and separate 
the upper ether layer. Extract the aqueous acid layer with two 15 ml portions 
of ether, combine the organic extracts, wash once with 5 ml of saturated 
sodium chloride solution and dry over magnesium sulphate. Filter, remove 
the ether from the filtrate by flash distillation and carefully distil the residual 
straw-coloured liquid. Collect the 2-methylcyclohexanone having b.p. 160- 
164 °C. The yield is about 3.5 g (63%). The purity may be checked by g.l.c. on 
a 1.5-m column of 10 per cent Silicone oil on Chromosorb W held at 128 °C, 
with a nitrogen flow rate of 40 ml/minute; t R is about 1.7 minutes. 

Note. (1) Reaction of lithium borohydride with water may be rapid and violent; do 
not expose to high humidity and avoid contact with eyes, skin and clothing (contact 
with cellulosic material may cause combustion). It should be handled with the same 
caution as is afforded to lithium aluminium hydride (Section 4.2.49, p. 445).

sodium-dried benzene (CAUTION) in a dry, 1 -litre, two-necked round- 
bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and dropping funnel both pro- 
tected with calcium chloride tubes. Add a few carborundum chips and heat to 
boiling in an oil bath at 75-85 °C. Add from the dropping funnel, in one por- 
tion, a solution of 16 g (0.065 ml) of aluminium t-butoxide (Section 4.2.2, 
p. 414) in 100 ml of anhydrous benzene. The reaction mixture becomes cloudy 
and develops a yellow colour in about 10 to 15 minutes. Continue gentle boil- 
ing at a bath temperature of 75-85 °C for 8 hours. Treat the cold mixture with 
40 ml of water and then with 100 ml of 10 per cent sulphuric acid. Shake 
vigorously and transfer to a 1 -litre separating funnel. Dilute the mixture with 
300 ml of water, shake for 5 minutes (filter, if necessary), then run off the 
yellow aqueous layer into a second separating funnel and extract the latter 
with 25 ml of benzene. Wash the combined benzene extracts thoroughly with 
water, dry with magnesium sulphate and remove the solvent on a rotary 
evaporator under reduced pressure. The yellow oily residue solidifies when it 
is cooled in an ice-salt bath and scratched with a glass rod; keep a small por- 
tion for seeding in the subsequent crystallisation. Dissolve the solid in a warm 
mixture of 14 ml of acetone and 20 ml of methanol, allow the solution to cool 
very slowly and seed, if necessary. When the bulk of the solid has crystallised, 
keep the mixture at °C for 24 hours, filter with suction, wash with 20 ml of 
ice-cold methanol and dry in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of almost 
colourless cholest-4-en-3-one, m.p. 79-80 °C, is 17 g (85%).

5.8.2 THE HYDRATION OF ALKYNES 

The direct hydration of a terminal alkyne, with dilute sulphuric acid in the pres- 
ence of a mercury salt, yields initially an enol which rearranges to the more 
stable ketone. The regioselectivity of the reaction is consistent with that pre- 
dicted on the basis of mechanistic theory.

The conversion of undec-10-ynoic aid to 10-oxoundecanoic acid (Expt 5.91) is

With non-terminal alkynes the preparative applications are more limited 
since a mixture of ketones is usually obtained, the proportions being dependent

trated sulphuric acid and 1.4 g of mercury(n) acetate. Dilute the dark 
coloured solution with 300 ml of water, filter and extract the solution with 
dichloromethane using a continuous extraction apparatus (Fig. 2.95) (1). 
Wash the dichloromethane extract carefully with distilled water until the 
washings are neutral, dry the extract and evaporate on a rotary evaporator. 
Recrystallise the solid residue from light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) using a 
little decolourising charcoal. The yield of keto-acid, m.p. 56-57 °C, is 1.65 g 
(50%). 

Note. (1) Batchwise extraction leads to the formation of stable emulsions which fre- 
quently take several days to break. When filling the continuous extraction apparatus, 
care should be taken to avoid forming an emulsion. 

5.8.3 THE THERMAL DECARBOXYLATION OF ACIDS OVER A METAL OXIDE CATALYST 

A long-established method of formation of symmetrical ketones (albeit in rather 
low yield) involves the pyrolysis of certain salts (usually calcium or barium) of 
carboxylic acids.

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.1 



The unsymmetrical carbonyl compound will clearly be accompanied by both 
possible symmetrical products, but the yield can be improved by the use of an 
excess of one of the carboxylate salts. 

A more satisfactory process for the preparation of either symmetrical or 
unsymmetrical ketones involves the passage of the vapour of the acid or mixture 
of acids over heated manganese(n) oxide or thorium oxide deposited upon 
pumice. The yields of unsymmetrical ketones are satisfactory (c. 50%) and the 
technique is particularly well suited for laboratory preparations on a reasonably 
large scale. Several examples are included in Expts 5.92 and 5.93.

Preparation of manganese(n) carbonate-pumice catalyst. Dissolve 70 g 
(0.35 mol) of manganese(n) chloride tetrahydrate in 100 ml of water and add 
a solution of 38 g (0.35 mol) of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 120 ml of 
water with mechanical stirring. Filter the precipitated manganese(n) carbon- 
ate and wash well with distilled water. Transfer the solid to a large evaporat- 
ing basin and add sufficient water to form a thick paste. Add sufficient pumice 
(4-8 mesh) with stirring so that most of the paste has been transferred to the 
pumice and heat cautiously (avoid local overheating) on an electric hotplate 
until the pumice lumps no longer cling together. If too much water is added 
to form the paste of manganese(n) carbonate initially, it will not adhere to the 
pumice satisfactorily. 

Diethyl ketone. Pack the catalyst into the Pyrex glass combustion tube of the 
pyrolysis apparatus illustrated in Fig. 2.65(c) and assemble the remaining 
components. Displace the air in the apparatus with nitrogen, and while main- 
taining a continued gentle gas flow, heat the pumice for 8 hours at 360-400 °C 
in order to convert the manganese(n) carbonate into manganese(n) oxide. If 
necessary the catalyst may be allowed to cool in a stream of nitrogen if the 
preparation needs to be interrupted at this point. Place 740 g (746 ml, 10 mol) 
of redistilled propanoic acid, b.p. 139-141 °C, in the dropping funnel, and 
with the furnace at about 350 °C, add the acid to the catalyst dropwise (about 
30 drops per minute); the stream of nitrogen is stopped when addition of acid 
is commenced. The apparatus requires little attention and the addition of 
acid occupies 48-72 hours. The distillate consists of two layers. Separate the 
lower aqueous layer, salt out the ketone with solid potassium carbonate and 
add it to the main ketonic layer. Treat the combined ketone fractions with 
small quantities of anhydrous potassium carbonate (1) until effervescence 
ceases (this both removes the excess of acid and dries the ketone), filter and 
distil through a short fractionating column. Collect the diethyl ketone at 101— 
103 °C. The yield is 252 g (29%). An improved yield may be obtained by re- 
circulating the distillate over the catalyst, but in practice this is rarely worth 
while. It must be remembered that on each occasion that the catalyst is 
allowed to cool a slow stream of nitrogen must be passed through the appar- 
atus to prevent the oxidation of the manganese(n) oxide catalyst. Assign the 
p.m.r. absorptions which occur at S 1.00 (t, 3H) and 2.38 (q, 2H). 

Note. (1) An alternative method of working up the distillate, which has its advantages 
when dealing with volatile ketones or when it is suspected that conversion into the

ketone is incomplete, is to treat the combined fractions of ketones with sodium 
hydroxide pellets until the mixture is alkaline. Should solids separate, these may be 
dissolved by the addition of a little water. The ketone is then separated, dried over 
anhydrous potassium carbonate and fractionated. 

Cognate preparations. Heptan-4-one (dipropyl ketone). Use 880 g (920 ml, 
lOmol) of butanoic acid, b.p. 162-164 °C. The yield of ketone, b.p. 142- 
143 °C, is 285 g* (46%). 

Pentan-2-one {methyl propyl ketone). Use 360 g (6 mol) of glacial acetic acid 
and 176g (184 ml, 2 mol) of butanoic acid. The yield of methyl propyl ketone, 
b.p. 102-104 °C, is 75 g (43%); 75 g of acetone, b.p. 56-57 °C,t are also 
obtained. Assign the l3 C-n.m.r. absorptions which occur at S 13.7, 17.5, 29.6, 
45.6 and 208.3. 

Hexan-3-one {ethyl propyl ketone). Use 296 g (298 ml, 4 mol) of propanoic 
acid and 352 g (368 ml, 4 mol) of butanoic acid. The yield is 214 g (53%) of 
ethyl propyl ketone, b.p. 122-124 °C; the by-products are 98 g of diethyl 
ketone, b.p. 100-102 °C, and 66 g of dipropyl ketone, b.p. 144-146 °C. 

Undecan-6-one {dipentyl ketone). Use 400 g (428 ml, 3.45 mol) of hexanoic 
acid, b.p. 204-206 °C. The yield of ketone, b.p. 222-226 °C, is 225 g (76%).

Preparation of thorium carbonate-pumice catalyst. Dissolve 294 g (0.5 mol) of 
thorium nitrate hexahydrate in the minimum of water (c. 450 ml) and add 
slowly a solution of 106 g (1 mol) of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 400 ml of 
water with stirring. Allow the thorium carbonate to settle, decant as much as 
possible of the mother-liquor and wash the sediment once by decantation 
with 500 ml of water. Make the resulting moist solid into a thick paste with 
distilled water and stir in pumice (4-8 mesh) until most of the suspension 
appears to be absorbed. Dry the impregnated pumice in quantities of 200 g by 
heating in a large evaporating dish upon an electric hotplate and stirring con- 
stantly with a glass rod. Stop the heating when the pumice particles no longer 
cling together. Sieve the resulting pumice, 250 g of a white powder (consisting 
largely of thorium carbonate but containing some oxide) are recovered and 
can be used for impregnating more pumice. The total weight of pumice cata- 
lyst thus prepared is about 1400g; the exact weight will depend upon the 
grade of pumice used. 

Benzyl methyl ketone. Fill the Pyrex combustion tube with catalyst and pro- 
ceed as in Expt 5.92 but use a temperature of 400-450 °C for the conversion of 
thorium carbonate into the corresponding oxide; 6-12 hours are usually 

* All the yields given refer to one circulation of the acid (or acids) over the catalyst, but can be im- 
proved by recirculating the product, from which the water layer has been removed, over the catalyst. 
With the higher ketones, the second circulation may result in carbonisation of the catalyst, thus 
rendering it inefficient. 

t The symmetrical ketones, produced as by-products in the preparation of mixed ketones, are 
separated by distillation through an efficient fractionating column. If acetone is a by-product (as in 
the preparation of pentan-2-one, methyl propyl ketone), some is lost in the washing process.

required for complete conversion and a slow stream of nitrogen should be 
maintained through the combustion tube. Place a solution of 170g (1.25 mol) 
of pure phenylacetic acid (m.p. 77 °C) in 225 g (3.75 mol) of glacial acetic acid 
in the funnel, and adjust its rate of flow into the catalyst tube to 1 drop every 2 
or 3 seconds. Also pass a slow stream of nitrogen (1 bubble per second) 
through the apparatus in order to keep the gases in motion; the rate of flow 
may be estimated by passing the inert gas through a concentrated sulphuric 
acid wash-bottle or 'bubbler' before it enters the furnace. When all the acid 
mixture has passed through the catalyst tube, separate the lower aqueous 
layer of the product and treat the organic layer with 10-20 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution until the washings are alkaline to litmus and then twice 
with water. Extract the aqueous layer twice with 50 ml portions of ether, wash 
the extracts successively with sodium hydroxide solution (until alkaline) and 
water, and add the resulting ether solution to the main product. Dry with 
magnesium sulphate, remove the ether on a rotary evaporator and distil the 
residue under reduced pressure preferably through a fractionating column. 
Collect the benzyl methyl ketone at 102-102.5 °C/20mmHg; the yield is 85 g 
(51%). The residue in the flask is dibenzyl ketone; it may be purified by trans- 
ferring to a smaller flask and redistilling (b.p. 200 °C/21 mmHg; m.p. 34- 
35 °C). The i.r. absorption for the carbon yl group appears at 1700 cm" '. The 
p.m.r. (CDC1 3 , TMS), shows signals at 5 2.02 (s,3H, Me), 3.58 (s,2H,CH 2 ) 
and 7.20 (s, 5H, Ph). 

Cognate preparations. Benzyl ethyl ketone. Use 204 g (1.5 mol) of phenyl- 
acetic acid (m.p. 77 °C) and 333 g (335.5 ml, 4.5 mol) of propanoic acid (b.p. 
139-141 °C), but omit the extraction with ether when working up the distil- 
late. Distil the dried product from a 500-ml round-bottomed flask through an 
efficient fractionating column. Collect the diethyl ketone at 99.5-102.5 °C 
(160g), and when the temperature rises to 130°C (b.p. 103-130°C: 7g) 
transfer the residue to a 250-ml flask and distil fractionally under reduced 
pressure. The benzyl ethyl ketone passes over mainly at 1 18-123 °C/ 
22 mmHg (105 g, 47%); the residue of high boiling point (34 g) consists largely 
of dibenzyl ketone. Pure benzyl ethyl ketone may be obtained by redistilling 
the fraction, b.p. 118-123°C/22mmHg, and collecting the fraction of b.p. 
113-1 15 °C/1 7 mmHg. 

Benzyl propyl ketone. Use 204 g ( 1 .5 mol) of pure phenylacetic acid and 396 g 
(414ml, 4.5 mol) of butanoic acid (b.p. 161-164 °C). Upon working up as for 
benzyl ethyl ketone, 180g of dipropyl ketone, b.p. 140-145 °C (mainly 143- 
145 °C), 108 g (45%) of crude benzyl propyl ketone, b.p. 240-260 °C, and 49 g 
of crude dibenzyl ketone (residue in flask) are obtained. Redistil the fraction 
of b.p. 240-260 °C and collect the benzyl propyl ketone at 243-247 °C (the 
pure ketone boils at 244 °C). 

4-Phenylbutan-2-one {methyl 2-phenylethyl ketone). Use lOOg (0.66 mol) of 
hydrocinnamic acid (3-phenylpropanoic acid) (m.p. 49-50 °C) (Expts 5.132 
and 6.138) and 160g (2.66 mol) of glacial acetic acid. The yield of methyl 2- 
phenylethyl ketone, b.p. 230-235 °C, is 70g (71%) (the pure ketone boils at 

234 °C). 

l-Phenylpentan-3-one {ethyl 2-phenylethyl ketone). Use 100 g (0.66 mol) of 
pure hydrocinnamic acid and 200g (201.5ml, 2.7 mol) of pure propanoic 

615 



5.8 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



acid. Fractionation of the distillate yields 70 g of diethyl ketone (b.p. 100- 
102 °C), 72 g (67%) of ethyl 2-phenylethyl ketone (b.p. 245-249 °C; the pure 
ketone boils at 248 °C) and 18 g of crude l,5-diphenylpentan-3-one (high b.p. 
residue). 

l-Phenylhexan-3-one {propyl 2-phenylethyl ketone). Use 100 g (0.66 mol) of 
pure hydrocinnamic acid and 235 g (245.5 ml, 2.66 mol) of pure butanoic acid. 
Upon working up as for benzyl ethyl ketone the following yields are 
obtained; 98 g of dipropyl ketone, b.p. 140-144 °C; 65 g (55%) of propyl 2- 
phenylethyl ketone, b.p. 139-143 °C/1 7 mmHg; and 22g of crude 1,5- 
diphenylpentan-3-one (high b.p. residue). The required ketone, upon redistil- 
lation, boils almost completely at 138-139 °C/16 mmHg. 

5.8.4 THE INTERACTION OF ORGANOMETALLIC COMPOUNDS WITH CARBOXYLIC ACID 
CHLORIDES AND ^-DIMETHYLCARBOXAMIDES 

Ketones are the intermediates in the synthesis of tertiary alcohols by the reac- 
tion of alkyl esters with organomagnesium or organolithium reagents (Section 
5.4.2, p. 532). Since the ketonic carbonyl-carbon is more reactive than the ester 
carbonyl-carbon, the reaction cannot normally be stopped at the intermediate 
stage. This problem is solved by using the highly reactive acid chloride with the 
less reactive cadmium dialkyl, which reacts only sluggishly, or not at all, with the 
carbonyl group in a ketone. If a Grignard reagent must be used with an acid 
chloride, an inverse addition procedure is essential. 

Cadmium dialkyls may be prepared by the addition of anhydrous cadmium 
chloride to the corresponding Grignard reagent in boiling ethereal solution. It is 
generally advantageous to replace the ether solvent by benzene before the addi- 
tion of the acid halide; a higher reflux temperature is then possible, thus reducing 
the time required for the reaction. A procedure for the direct reaction of a highly 
reactive form of cadmium metal with alkyl and aryl halides may be more con- 
venient. 126 

2R 1 -MgBr + CdCl 2 &gt; R 2 Cd + MgBr 2 + MgCl 2 

R 2 Cd + 2ClCOCH 2 -R 2 &gt; 2R'-COCH 2 -R 2 + CdCl 2 

For most purposes the use of 1.0 mol of an alkyl or aryl bromide (for the pre- 
paration of the cadmium dialkyl or diaryl through the Grignard reagent) to 
0.8 mol of the acid halide is recommended. This results in nearly equivalent 
molar ratios of the cadmium dialkyl and the acid halide, since the overall yield of 
the former is usually about 80 per cent. The entire preparation can be carried 
out in one flask without the isolation of intermediates. Experimental details are 
given for the preparation of l-chlorohexan-2-one (Expt 5.94). 

Because of the toxicity of cadmium compounds two alternative methods for 
the preparation of ketones from carboxylic acid derivatives are worthy of atten- 
tion. The first involves the reaction of organocopper reagents [formed from 
copper(i) iodide and an alkyllithium] with a carboxylic acid chloride. I27a ' b

tional groups (iodo, cyano, acyl and carbalkoxy) is tolerated. The illustrative 
example (cognate preparation, Expt 5.94) is the formation of tetradecane-5,10- 
dione from 6-oxodecanoyl chloride; in this preparation the description of the 
balloon technique for the maintenance of an inert atmosphere is instructive. 




A second cognate preparation in Expt 5.94 describes a general procedure for 
the conversion of JV,JV-dimethylcarboxamides into ketones by reaction with 
primary alkyllithiums. 1270 As the reaction is not successful with secondary 
alkyllithiums, a branched chain ketone such as 4-methylheptan-3-one is pre- 
pared from ethyllithium and JV,JV,2-trimethylpentanamide, and not from 2- 
pentyllithium and JV,JV-dimethylpropanamide.

CAUTION: All operations in this preparation must be carried out in an effi- 
cient fume cupboard owing to the toxicity of benzene. 

Equip a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a sealed Hershberg stirrer (prefer- 
ably of tantalum wire) (see Fig. 2.49), a reflux condenser and a 250-ml drop- 
ping funnel (1). All apparatus must be thoroughly dry. Place 8.1 g (0.33 mol) 
of dry magnesium turnings in the flask, add 60 ml of anhydrous ether through 
the dropping funnel and charge the latter with a solution of 46 g (35.5 ml, 
0.33 mol) of butyl bromide in 1 10 ml of dry ether. Start the stirrer and prepare 
the Grignard reagent in the usual manner (compare Expt 5.39). When the 
formation of the Grignard reagent is complete, cool the flask in an ice bath 
with stirring, remove the dropping funnel and, when cold, add 32.7 g 
(0.178 mol) of anhydrous cadmium chloride (Section 4.2.72, p. 423) in por- 
tions from a small conical flask during 5-10 minutes. Replace the dropping 
funnel, remove the ice bath, stir for 5 minutes and then heat the mixture under 
reflux with stirring for 45 minutes; at this point a test for the presence of Grig- 
nard reagent is made (2); continue stirring and refluxing until the test is 
negative. Replace the reflux condenser by a bend adapter connected to a con- 
denser set for distillation, distil off the ether as stirring is continued; continue 
the distillation, with stirring, on a water bath until it becomes very slow and 
dark viscous residue remains. At this point add 120 ml of anhydrous benzene 
(CAUTION) from the dropping funnel, and continue the distillation until a 
further 35 ml of liquid has passed over. Then add 120 ml of dry benzene and 
replace the reflux condenser; reflux the mixture with vigorous stirring in 
order to break up the cake inside the flask. Remove the heating bath, cool the 
mixture to about 5°C in an ice bath and add a solution of 38 g (25.5 ml, 
0.33 mol) of chloroacetyl chloride (b.p. 105 °C) in 70 ml of anhydrous pure 

617 



5.8 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



benzene from the dropping funnel during 2-3 minutes. After completion of 
the addition, stir the reaction mixture and hold the temperature at 1 5-20 °C 
for 3 hours and then at 20-25 °C for a further 1.5 hours. Add excess of crushed 
ice (c. 200 g) and dilute sulphuric acid. Separate the benzene and aqueous 
layers; extract the aqueous phase with two 30 ml portions of benzene. Wash 
the combined benzene layers successively with 70 ml of water, 70 ml of satur- 
ated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, 70 ml of water and 35 ml of satur- 
ated sodium chloride solution. Filter the benzene solution through a little 
anhydrous sodium sulphate (this separates most of the suspended water), 
remove the benzene by flash distillation at atmospheric pressure and distil the 
residue under reduced pressure through a short fractionating column. Collect 
the l-chlorohexane-2-one at 71-72°C/15mmHg; the yield is 24 g (54%). 

Notes. (1) It is best to conduct the preparation in a nitrogen atmosphere; the appar- 
atus shown in Fig 2.60 may be used. 
(2) See Expt 5.8, Note (3). 

Cognate preparations. Tetradecane-5,10-dione {via lithium dialkylcuprates). 1213 
Into a dry 50-ml, two-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a rubber 
septum and a three-way stopcock bearing a wired-on balloon, is placed a 
magnetic stirrer bar and copper(i) iodide (571 mg, 3.00 mmol). The balloon is 
filled with nitrogen. The three-way stopcock is used to evacuate and then fill 
the flask with nitrogen. The purging procedure is repeated two more times, 
and the flask is gently flamed during the last evacuation. Anhydrous diethyl 
ether (8 ml) is added and the system is cooled to — 40 °C (1). n-Butyllithium 
in pentane (4.5 ml of a 1.32 m solution, 6.0 mmol) is injected. After about 5 
minutes at — 40 °C, the temperature is lowered to — 78 °C. A precooled 
ethereal solution (1 ml) of 6-oxodecanoyl chloride (213 mg, 1.04 mmol) (2) is 
injected. After 15 minutes at — 78 °C, absolute methanol (352 mg, 11.0 mmol) 
is injected and the reaction mixture is allowed to reach room temperature. It 
is poured with stirring into an equal volume of saturated aqueous ammonium 
chloride; ether extraction followed by rotary evaporation gives 193 mg (83%) 
of tetradecane-5,10-dione, m.p. 59-62 °C, with consistent i.r. and n.m.r. spec- 
troscopic properties. Recrystallisation from pentane gives white needles 
(162 mg, 70%), m.p. 65-66 °C. 

Notes. (1) A temperature of 0°C is used in the case of reactions involving methyllith- 
ium, i.e. for the preparation of alkyl methyl ketones. 

(2) This acid chloride is prepared from oxalyl chloride and 6-oxodecanoic acid. l27d 
The reaction procedure is applicable to a range of unsubstituted and substituted ali- 
phatic and aromatic acid chlorides. 

General procedure for the preparation of ketones from A,A-dimethylcarbox- 
amides and alkyllithiums. 1270 A suspension of lithium ribbon (1.6g-atom), cut 
into small pieces, in anhydrous ether (800 ml) is prepared in a flask fitted with 
a reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet tube, thermometer, a pressure-equalising 
addition funnel and a stirrer. The suspension is cooled to — 10 °C, and, while 
the system is being swept with nitrogen, a solution of the required alkyl bro- 
mide (0.83 mol) in ether (200 ml) is added over a period of 2 hours. The mix- 
ture is stirred for 1 hour longer at — 10 °C. Then the temperature is lowered 
to — 20 °C and a solution of the required JV,JV-dimethylcarboxamide in 
anhydrous ether (200 ml) is added dropwise over a period of 1.5 hours. The 



618 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.8 



temperature is then allowed to rise gradually to 25 °C over a period of 3 hours 
with continued stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere. At the end of this time, 
the solution is cooled to — 10 °C and cold, saturated ammonium chloride 
solution (500 ml) is slowly added. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes, the 
ether layer is separated, washed with 1 m hydrochloric acid, water and dried. 
Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure leaves a colourless liquid 
residue which is distilled through a 25-cm Vigreux column. 

5.8.5 THE HYDROLYSIS AND DECARBOXYLATION OF /'-KETO ESTERS AND THE 
HYDROLYSIS OF /&gt;' DIKETONES 

An alternative representation of the disconnection strategy shown on p. 606 for 
these methods of synthesis of ketones is formulated below. 

From this it could be envisaged that an electrophilic synthon from, for example, 
an alkyl halide could react at the anionic carbon site of the mesomeric species, 
generated from an alkyl methyl ketone with base. In practice such a procedure 
gives rise to many competing side reactions, e.g. self-condensation of the alkyl 
methyl ketone, uncontrolled di- or tri-alkylation, alkylation at the alternative op- 
position, etc. a-Alkylation can be achieved by the use of an activating group 
such as the carbethoxy group ( — C0 2 Et). This group ensures regiospecific pro- 
ton removal, usually with base under anhydrous conditions, and almost total 
conversion into the conjugate base. Following alkylation with an alkyl halide, 
the activating group is removed by the action of dilute alkali in the cold followed 
by acidification and boiling. An important extension is the further reaction of 
the alkylated /?-keto ester with base, followed by another alkylation step to give 
after appropriate hydrolysis the ketone, R'-CO-CHR 2 R 3 .

Ketones of great structural variety may therefore be prepared by careful selec- 
tion of the starting /?-keto ester (cf. Section 5.14.3, p. 736) and the alkyl halides. 
The standard procedure is illustrated for the preparation of hexan-2-one from 
ethyl acetoacetate (Expt 5.95), and it may be suitably adapted to the preparation 
of most alkyl (straight-chain and branched-chain) methyl ketones. 

A general convenient alkyl methyl ketone synthesis, which utilises the /?-keto 
ester system as an intermediate, involves the acylation of a malonate ester by 
way of the ethoxymagnesium derivative. Hydrolysis and decarboxylation to the 
ketone is accomplished by heating in acid solution; the synthesis of cyclohexyl 
methyl ketone is the illustrative example (Expt 5.96).

A related synthesis of alkyl methyl ketones involves the preparation and

one step by refluxing a mixture of pentane-2,4-dione and the alkyl halide in alco- 
holic potassium carbonate. This method is illustrated by the preparation of 5- 
methylhex-5-en-one (Expt 5.97).

Fit a 2-litre three-necked flask with an efficient double surface condenser and 
a separatory funnel; close the central neck with a stopper. The apparatus 
must be perfectly dry. Place 34.5 g (1.5 mol) of clean sodium (Section 4.2.65, 
p. 462) cut into small pieces in the flask and clamp the flask by the wide cen- 
tral neck. Measure out 1 litre of super-dry ethanol (Section 4.1.9, p. 401), and 
place about 500 ml in the separatory funnel; insert calcium chloride guard- 
tubes at the top of the condenser and the separatory funnel respectively. Place 
a large bowl beneath the flask and have a large wet towel in readiness to con- 
trol the vigour of the subsequent reaction. Run in about 200 ml of the abso- 
lute ethanol on to the sodium (1); a vigorous reaction takes place. If the 
ethanol refluxes violently in the condenser, cool the flask by wrapping it in 
the wet towel and also, if necessary, run a stream of cold water over it. As 
soon as the reaction moderates somewhat, introduce more alcohol to main- 
tain rapid, but controllable, refluxing. In this manner most of the sodium 
reacts rapidly and the time required to produce the solution of sodium 
ethoxide is considerably reduced. Finally add the remainder of the ethanol 
and reflux the mixture on a water bath until the sodium has reacted com- 
pletely. Remove the stopper in the central neck and introduce a sealed 
mechanical stirrer. Add 195 g (190 ml, 1.5 mol) of pure ethyl acetoacetate, stir 
the solution and heat to gentle boiling, then run in 205 g (1 51 ml, 1.66 mol) of 
propyl bromide over a period of about 60 minutes. Continue the refluxing 
and stirring until a sample of the solution is neutral to moist litmus paper 
(6-10 hours); the reaction is then complete. 

Cool the mixture and decant the solution from the sodium bromide; wash 
the salt with two 20 ml portions of absolute ethanol and add the washings to 
the main solution. Distil off the ethanol, which contains a slight excess of 
propyl bromide, through a short fractionating column from a water bath. The 
residue (A) of crude ethyl propylacetoacetate may be used directly in the pre- 
paration of hexan-2-one. If the fairly pure ester is required, distil the crude 
product under diminished pressure and collect the fraction boiling at 109- 
113°C/27mmHg (183 g, 71%) (B). 

To prepare hexan-2-one add the crude ester (/I) or the redistilled ethyl 
propylacetoacetate (B) to 1500 ml of a 5 per cent solution of sodium hydrox- 
ide contained in a 4-litre flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. Continue 
the stirring at room temperature for 4 hours; by this time the mono- 
substituted acetoacetic ester is completely hydrolysed and passes into solu-

tion. Transfer the mixture to a large separatory funnel, allow to stand and 
remove the small quantity of unsaponified material which separates as an 
upper oily layer. Place the aqueous solution of sodium propylacetoacetate in 
a 3-litre two-necked flask fitted with a small separatory funnel and a wide 
bent delivery tube connected to a condenser set for downward distillation. 
Add 150 ml of 50 per cent by weight sulphuric acid (d. 1.40) slowly through 
the separatory funnel with shaking; a vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide 
occurs. When the latter has subsided, heat the reaction mixture slowly to the 
boiling point and distil slowly until the total volume is reduced by about one- 
half; by this time all the hexan-2-one should have passed over. The distillate 
contains the ketone, ethanol and small quantities of acetic and valeric acids. 
Add small portions of solid sodium hydroxide to the distillate until it is alka- 
line and redistil the solution until 80-90 per cent has been collected; discard 
the residue. 

Separate the ketone layer from the water, and redistil the latter until about 
one-third of the material has passed over. Remove the ketone after salting out 
any dissolved ketone with potassium carbonate (2). Wash the combined 
ketone fractions four times with one-third the volume of 35-40 per cent cal- 
cium chloride solution in order to remove the alcohol. Dry over 15 g of 
anhydrous calcium chloride; it is best to shake in a separatory funnel with 1- 
2g of the anhydrous calcium chloride, remove the saturated solution of cal- 
cium chloride as formed, and then allow to stand over 10 g of calcium chlor- 
ide in a dry flask. Filter and distil. Collect the hexan-2-one at 126-128 °C. The 
yield is 71 g (67%). 

Notes. (1) The addition of the ethanol to the sodium, although attended by a very 
vigorous reaction which must be carefully controlled, is preferable to the reverse pro- 
cedure of adding the sodium in small pieces to the ethanol. The latter method is longer 
and has the further disadvantage that it necessitates frequent handling and exposure 
to the air of small pieces of sodium. 

(2) A more complete recovery of the ketone from the aqueous solution may be 
obtained by repeated distillation of the aqueous layer until no appreciable amount of 
ketone is found in the distillate. The procedure outlined is, however, quite satisfactory. 

Cognate preparation. Heptan-2-one. Use 34.5 g (1.5 mol) of sodium, 1 litre of 
super-dry absolute ethanol, 195 g (1.5 mol) of redistilled ethyl acetoacetate 
and 225 g (177 ml, 1.63 mol) of dry butyl bromide (Expt 5.54). This yields 
280 g of crude or 200 g (72%) of pure ethyl butylacetoacetate, b.p. 1 1 2-1 1 6 °C/ 
16mmHg. Upon hydrolysis 105g (80%) of heptan-2-one, b.p. 149-151 °C, are 
isolated.

immediately, to proceed for about 5 minutes and then add carefully 1 50 ml of

bath and allow the reaction mixture to reflux gently while a solution of 70 g 
(0.44 mol) of diethyl malonate in 50 ml of dry ether is added with stirring. On 
completion of the addition, heat the mixture under reflux for about 3 hours or 
until all the magnesium has reacted. Then add with vigorous stirring a solu- 
tion of 58 g (0.4 mol) of cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride (Expt 5.138) in 50 ml of 
dry ether. Heat the reaction mixture under reflux for 2 hours and then cool 
and acidify with 50 ml of dilute sulphuric acid. Separate the ether layer and 
extract the residual aqueous solution with two 50 ml portions of ether. Wash 
the combined ether extracts with water and evaporate the solvent on a rotary 
evaporator. To the residue add a solution of 120 ml of glacial acetic acid, 
1 5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and 80 ml of water and heat under reflux 
for 5 hours. Cool the reaction mixture, basify by the careful addition of 100 ml 
of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and extract the solution with four 
50 ml portions of ether. Dry the combined ether extracts over sodium sul- 
phate and remove the ether on a rotary evaporator. Distil the crude product 
at atmospheric pressure through a short fractionating column. The yield of 
cyclohexyl methyl ketone of b.p. 178-1 80 °C is 35 g (70%).

5.8.6 THE ACID-CATALYSED REARRANGEMENT OF 1.2-DIOLS 

The conversion of pinacol (Expt 5.35) to t-butyl methyl ketone (pinacolone, 
Expt 5.98) under acid conditions exemplifies a general reaction of 1,2-diols (the 
pinacol-pinacolone rearrangement). The mechanism, formulated below, involves 
loss of water from the protonated 1,2-diol accompanied by a 1,2-nucleophilic 
shift of a methyl group.

In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask carrying a dropping funnel and a connec- 
tion to a condenser set for distillation, place 50 g of pinacol hydrate (Expt 
5.35) and 130 ml of 3 m sulphuric acid. Distil the mixture until the upper layer 
of the distillate no longer increases in volume (15-20 minutes). Separate the 
pinacolone layer from the water and return the latter to the reaction flask. 
Then add 12 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid to the water, followed by a 
second 50 g portion of pinacol hydrate. Repeat the distillation. Repeat the 
process twice more until 200 g of pinacol hydrate have been used. 

Dry the combined pinacolone fractions over magnesium sulphate and dis- 
til. Collect the pinacolone at 103-107 °C. The yield is 62 g (70%). 

5.8.7 THE OXIDATIVE HYDROLYSIS OF NITRONATE SALTS FROM SECONDARY 
NITROALKANES 

Oxidation with potassium permanganate of the nitronate salts to yield carbonyl 
compounds has been discussed in Section 5.7.7, p. 599; the method is very suit- 
able for the preparation of ketones from secondary nitroalkanes and the experi- 
mental details may be readily adapted from Expt 5.84. 

5.8.8. SOME METHODS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE CARBONYL GROUP 

A range of methods has been developed for the protection of the carbonyl group 
in multifunctional aliphatic and alicyclic aldehydes and ketones. This has been 
necessary because in many multistage syntheses, modification of other function- 
alities (e.g. oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, nucleophilic and electrophilic addi- 
tions and displacements, etc.) requires a differing range of experimental 
conditions, and that protective group must be selected which is stable in the 
presence of the reaction medium. A further feature that should be noted is that 

623 



5.8 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



owing to differing reactivity of a carbonyl group in aliphatic (and alicyclic) alde- 
hydes and ketones, and in their a, ^-unsaturated and aromatic analogues, select- 
ive protection in, for example, a dicarbonyl compound may be possible and 
desirable. 

The most widely used protective groups for aliphatic and alicyclic aldehydes 
and ketones are: (a) cyclic acetals and (b) cyclic dithioacetals and hemithio- 
acetals. The use of semicarbazones, oximes and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones (for 
preparation see Section 9.6.13, p. 1257) is less common but has found application 
in certain instances where the more vigorous methods required for deprotection 
are not detrimental. 

CYCLIC ACETALS 

The reaction of the carbonyl group with ethane- 1,2-diol or propane- 1,3-diol in 
the presence of a suitable catalyst gives a 1,3-dioxolane [(9); R 1 = R 2 = H] or a 
1,3-dioxane [(10); R 1 = R 2 = H] respectively (cf. Section 5.4.6, p. 553, and 
Section 5.10.3, p. 652). Aldehydes give 2-alkyl derivatives [(9) and (10), R 1 = 
alkyl, R 2 = H] and ketones give 2,2-dialkyl derivatives [R 1 and R 2 = alkyl].

The catalysts for derivative formation include toluene-p-sulphonic acid (with 
azeotropic removal of water, 128 or the use of a water scavenger such as triethyl 
orthoformate 129 ), boron trifluoride-etherate, 130 or hydrogen chloride. 131 For 
carbonyl compounds possessing acid-labile functional groups, pyridinium 
toluene-p-sulphonate 132 (PPTS, p. 552), or passage of the mixture of the diol 
and carbonyl compound down a column of Amberlyst-15 may be more suit- 
able. 133 The procedure given below 128 " has been widely used, and is illustrated 
by the protection of the carbonyl group in ethyl acetoacetate.

Procedure for 1,3-dioxolane formation with ethyl acetoacetate by azeotropic 
removal of water. 128 " Ethyl acetoacetate (30 g, 0.23 mol), ethane- 1,2-diol (16g, 
0.248 mol), a crystal of toluene-p-sulphonic acid and benzene (50 ml) 
(CAUTION) were placed in a round-bottomed flask fitted with a Dean and 
Stark water separator (Fig. 2.31(a)) and a reflux condenser. The reaction mix- 
ture was heated until no more water collected. The product was fractionally dis- 
tilled under reduced pressure to give the cyclic acetal (35 g, 87%), b.p. 99.5- 
101°C/17-18mmHg. 

The 1,3-dioxolane and 1,3-dioxane systems are stable to an extremely wide 
range of reaction procedures provided that an acidic medium is avoided. Depro- 
tection is effected under a wide variety of mild acid conditions such as, for 
example, aqueous tartaric acid, 134 perchloric acid, 135 or moist silica gel either 
alone or in the presence of oxalic or sulphuric acids. 136 The mild oxidative 
cleavage reaction with triphenylmethyl tetrafluoroborate in dichloromethane is 

624 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.1 



sometimes useful. 137 An illustrative procedure involving conversion of the 1,3- 
dioxane system into a dimethyl acetal (with methanolic hydrogen chloride) fol- 
lowed by hydrolysis with oxalic acid is described in Expt 5.9. 

CYCLIC DITHIOACETALS AND HEMITHIOACETALS 

The reaction of aldehydes or ketones with ethane- 1,2-dithiol or propane- 1,3- 
dithiol to form 1 ,3-dithiolanes or 1 ,3-dithianes is an important reaction, as these 
compounds under suitable conditions are acyl anion equivalents (see Section 
5.9, p. 626). These cyclic dithioacetals have been less used as protective groups, 
though when required are formed in high yield in the presence of boron 
trifluoride-etherate. ' 38 

1 ,3-Oxathiolanes (11) are formed from aldehydes and ketones by reaction 
with 2-mercaptoethanol (HS-CH 2 -CH 2 OH) in the presence of, for example, zinc 
chloride-sodium acetate in dioxane solution at room temperature, 139 or boron 
trifluoride-etherate. 140 They are more stable to an acidic medium than the 1,3- 
dithianes, and therefore may be the protective group of choice in certain 
instances.

General procedure for the preparation of oxathiolanes. 140 To a stirred refluxing 
solution of cycloheptanone (56.1 g, 0.5 mol) and 2-mercaptoethanol (29.1 g,

boron trifluoride-etherate (71 g, 0.5 mol). After an additional hour of being 
heated under reflux, the solution was allowed to cool, washed with 0.1 m sodium 
hydrogen carbonate solution (2 x 100 ml) and once with saturated sodium 
chloride solution (100 ml), and dried over magnesium sulphate. After removal of 
the solvent under vacuum on a rotary evaporator, the residue was distilled 
under vacuum to yield a small forerun which was followed by 2-oxa-5- 
thiaspiro[4.6]undecane (79.2 g, 92%), b.p. 77-78 °C/1.2mmHg, n£ 5 1.5165. 

Deprotection of 1,3-oxathiolanes may be effected in a buffered medium in the 
presence of either mercury(n) chloride or with Raney nickel, 141 or very conveni- 
ently with Chloramine-T. 142 In this latter deprotection reaction, 1,4- 
oxathiaspiro[4.4]nonane (12) affords cyclopentanone in 91 per cent yield when 
treated for 2 minutes with Chloramine-T in 85 per cent methanol-water at 
25 °C.

These carbonyl compounds are important starting materials for the synthesis of 
alicyclic and heterocyclic ring systems (see Chapters 7, and 8 respectively). Their 
methods of preparation may be categorised by the use of a retrosynthetic 
analysis which includes both functional group interconversion and disconnec- 
tion strategies. Table 5.2 is an illustrative summary of the synthons that are 
generated by disconnection of the various carbon-carbon bonds which connect 
the two carbonyl groups in the case of 1,2-, 1,3- and 1 ,4-dike tones. Table 5.3 
gives an abbreviated selection of reagent equivalents of these synthons. Thus a 
method of preparation of a 1,2-diketone, for example, could be the acylation of a 
1,3-dithiane anion [(1) with (2)]; similarly that of a 1,4-diketone by the Michael 
reaction of a nitronate anion with an a, ^-unsaturated ketone [(2) with (5)].

t The carbonyl group requires protection prior to Grignard reagent formation. 



Clearly there are a number of possible combinations, particularly when possible 
strategies for the preparation of unsymmetrical and substituted diketones [e.g. 
R^CO-CHj-CO-R 2 and R^CO-CHCR^-CO-R 3 ] are considered. A few of these 
are exemplified in the preparative methods which are discussed below. 

5.9.1 1.2-DICARBONYL COMPOUNDS 

The three preparative methods which are illustrated in this section are (a) the 
oxidation, or (b) the nitrosation, of the a-methylene group in a symmetrical 
ketone or an aryl alkyl ketone (Expts 5.99 and 5.100), and (c) the oxidation of 
alkynes under PTC conditions (Expt 5.101).

of phenylglyoxal from acetophenone (Expt 5.99). The mechanism probably in- 
volves the formation of a selenite ester of the enol form of the carbonyl com- 
pound.

With alkyl methyl ketones (R-CH 2 - COMe) the reaction is complicated by the 
presence of two alternative sites of oxidation; in practice the methyl group 
appears to be oxidised in preference to the methylene group for reasons which 
have not been adequately clarified, but in any case the yields are usually poor. 
Unsubstituted, or symmetrically substituted cyclic ketones possessing of course 
an a-methylene group, are similarly converted into 1,2-diketones (e.g. the forma- 
tion of cyclohexane-l,2-dione from cyclohexanone, Expt 5.99, cognate prepara- 
tion); unsymmetrically substituted cyclic ketones would normally give rise to 
regioisomers. 

A further interesting case is provided by the synthesis of ninhydrin (Expt 5.99, 
cognate preparation) from indane-l,3-dione (Expt 7.9) in which the methylene 
group is activated by two adjacent carbonyl groups. Ninhydrin is the stable 
monohydrate of the triketone, indane-l,2,3-trione, and is a well-known colori- 
metric reagent for amino acids (Section 2.31). 

Alkyl methyl ketones undergo nitrosation at the reactive methylene group 
when treated with nitrous acid or an alkyl nitrite [Method (fc)]. The presence of 
hydrogen on the a-carbon permits tautomeric rearrangement to the oxime of a 
1,2-dicarbonyl compound. Acidic hydrolysis of the oxime, which is best carried 
out in the presence of a hydroxylamine acceptor such as laevulinic acid, 143 
affords a further useful route to the 1,2-dicarbonyl system. 

N=0 N-OH O 

In the example included here (Expt 5.100) ethyl methyl ketone is nitrosated to 
butane-2,3-dione monoxime, which is then reacted with hydroxylamine to give 
the dioxime, dimethylglyoxime, the well-known reagent for nickel. 

A further general route to the 1,2-dicarbonyl system involves the oxidation of 
a-ketols (acyloins) (cf. the preparation of benzil from benzoin, Expt 6.143). The 
acyloins may be prepared from carboxylate esters by a radical coupling reaction 
involving the use of finely divided sodium metal in anhydrous ether, benzene, or 
toluene. ' 44

A modification involves the addition to the reaction mixture of chlorotrimethyl- 
silane which gives the bis-(trimethylsilyloxy)alkene which is hydrolysed to yield 
the acyloin. 145 A preparative example, which also illustrates an intramolecular 
acyloin reaction to form an alicyclic ring system, is given in Expt 7.10.

Finally, [Method (c)], treatment of an internal alkyne with potassium per- 
manganate under PTC conditions leads to a good yield of a 1,2-diketone. I46 
The reaction probably proceeds via hydroxylation of the triple bond, tautomeric 
rearrangement to the a-ketol, and oxidation to the diketone. The reaction is 
illustrated by the conversion of 1-phenylpent-l-yne to l-phenylpentane-1,2- 
dione (Expt 5.101).

Terminal alkynes under these conditions undergo oxidative cleavage to the car-

CAUTION: Selenium and its compounds are toxic {Section 2.3); carry out this 
and the following preparations in an efficient fume cupboard. 

Fit a 500-ml three-necked flask with a sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser 
and a thermometer. Place 300 ml of dioxane (1), 55.5 g (0.5 mol) of pure 
selenium dioxide (Section A.2.64, p. 460) and 10 ml of water in the flask, heat 
the mixture to 50-55 °C and stir until the solid has dissolved. Remove the 
thermometer momentarily and add 60 g (0.5 mol) of acetophenone in one lot; 
replace the thermometer. Reflux the mixture, with stirring, for 4 hours; after 
about 2 hours the solution becomes clear and little further precipitation of 
selenium is observable. Decant the hot solution from the precipitated sele- 
nium through a fluted filter paper, and remove the dioxane and water by dis- 
tillation through a short column. Distil the residual phenylglyoxal under 
reduced pressure and collect the fraction boiling at 95-97 °C/25 mmHg. The 
yield of pure phenylglyoxal (a yellow liquid) is 48 g (72%); this sets to a stiff 
gel on standing, probably as a result of polymerisation, but may be recovered 
without appreciable loss by distillation. The aldehyde is best preserved in the 
form of the hydrate, which is prepared by dissolving the yellow liquid in 3.5-4 
volumes of hot water and allowing to crystallise. Phenylglyoxal hydrate (m.p. 
91 °C) also crystallises from chloroform, ethanol or ether-light petroleum 
(b.p. 60-80 °C); upon distillation under diminished pressure, the free aldehyde 
is obtained. 

Note. (1) Rectified spirit can also be used as solvent. The dioxane can, however, be 
recovered and used in a subsequent run (cf. Section 4.1.20, p. 407). 

Cognate preparations. Cyclohexane-l,2-dione. Equip a 1 -litre, three-necked 
flask with a reflux condenser, thermometer and dropping funnel. Place 250 g 
(2.55 mol) of pure cyclohexanone in the flask, heat to 70-80 °C and add a 
solution of 280 g (2.52 mol) of pure selenium dioxide in 1500 ml of rectified 
spirit from the dropping funnel over a period of 2 hours, maintaining the tem- 
perature at 70-80 °C. Reflux the reaction mixture for a further 2 hours. Distil 
off as much of the alcohol as possible and decant the liquid residue from the 
elemental selenium. Wash the latter several times with ether, and combine the 

629 



5.9 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ether extracts with the decanted liquid. Remove the ether by distillation and 
distil the residue under reduced pressure (c. 25 mmHg): about 200 g of an oil, 
consisting of cyclohexane-l,2-dione, cyclohexane and water, is obtained. Dis- 
solve the oil in 1 litre of ether, and extract thrice with ice-cold 10 per cent 
potassium hydroxide solution; the total amount of potassium hydroxide 
solution should be equivalent to 1.5 times that necessary to react with the oil 
assumed to be the pure dione in the monoenol form (about 1.51). Shake the 
alkaline extract once with ether to remove cyclohexanone, acidify with ice- 
cold hydrochloric acid and then saturate with salt. Extract the hydrochloric 
acid solution with ether, dry the ethereal extract with magnesium sulphate, 
remove the ether by distillation at normal pressure and distil the residue 
under reduced pressure. Collect the cyclohexane- 1,2-dione (a pale green 
liquid) at 96-97 °C/25 mmHg; the compound decomposes slightly on keep- 
ing. The yield is 55-56 g (19%). 

It is important that the synthesis should be carried out as quickly as pos- 
sible, particularly the washing with alkali at °C, since the latter tends to con- 
vert the product into 1-hydroxycyclopentanecarboxylic acid.

In a 500-ml three-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and mechanical 
stirrer, place 1 1 g (0. 1 mol) of pure selenium dioxide dissolved in 240 ml of 
dioxane and 5 ml of water. Heat the stirred solution to 60-70 °C, remove the 
source of heat, add 15 g (0.1 mol) of crude indane-1, 3-dione (Expt 7.10) and 
reflux the resulting mixture for 6 hours. A solid separates during this period. 
Filter the mixture, transfer the filtrate to a distilling flask and distil off about 
180 ml of dioxane; then add 100 ml of water, boil the solution to coagulate the 
red tarry precipitate and remove it by filtration. Concentrate the filtrate to 
about 50 ml and filter. Boil the filtrate with 0.2-0.3 g of decolourising carbon, 
filter again, concentrate to 20-25 ml and keep at room temperature. Collect 
the crystals of crude ninhydrin by suction filtration, and recrystallise from hot 
water with the addition of a little decolourising carbon, if necessary (1). The 
yield of colourless ninhydrin is 6g (34%); the crystals turn red between 125 
and 130°C and melt at 242-243 °C. 

Note. (1) Recrystallisation from water with the use of decolourising carbon should 
yield almost colourless crystals; selenium-containing contaminants may, however, 
give rise to discoloration. In this case a further recrystallisation with the addition of 
decolourising carbon and a little tin(n) chloride should be carried out.

In a 500-ml three-necked flask, supported on a water bath in a fume cup- 
board and provided with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser and a ther- 
mometer, place 72 g (90 ml, 1 mol) of dried and redistilled ethyl methyl ketone 
(Section 4.1.22, p. 408). Introduce a follower bar and stir magnetically. Add 
3 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and warm the liquid to 40 °C. Then 
add 103 g (115 ml, 1 mol) of butyl nitrite (b.p. 76-79 °C) or 1 17 g (134 ml, 
1 mol) of isopentyl nitrite (b.p. 96-99 °C) (Section 4.2./, p. 413) slowly, main- 
taining the temperature at 40-50 °C; the mixture must be stirred vigorously. 
Heat is generated in the reaction so that cooling may now be required. Con- 
tinue the stirring, without cooling, for 30 minutes after all the nitrite has been 
added. The reaction mixture now consists of a solution of butane-2,3-dione 
monoxime in butan-1-ol or 3-methylbutan-l-ol. To remove any unused 
ketone, treat the mixture with a cold solution of 45 g of sodium hydroxide in 
100 ml of water and stir for 20-30 minutes. Transfer the reaction mixture to a 
separatory funnel and extract the reddish-brown solution twice with 50 ml 
portions of ether: the alcohol may be recovered, if desired, by fractionation of 
the ethereal extracts. Keep the aqueous layer; it contains the sodium salt of 
butane-2,3-dione monoxime (1). Prepare a solution of 70 g (lmol) of 
hydroxylamine hydrochloride or of 82 g (1 mol) of hydroxylamine sulphate in 
about three times its weight of water, and add sodium hydroxide solution 
until the solution is neutral to litmus. Place the aqueous solution of the 
sodium salt of the monoxime in a 1-litre round-bottomed flask and add the 
hydroxylamine solution with stirring. Heat the mixture on a water bath for 
about 45 minutes. Filter off the precipitated dioxime (2) while the solution is 
still hot, wash it with hot water and drain well. Recrystallise the crude prod- 
uct from about 10 times its weight of rectified spirit. The yield of pure di- 
methylglyoxime (a white, crystalline solid, m.p. 240 °C) is 55 g (47%). 

Notes. (1) If it is desired to isolate the monoxime, cool a portion (say one-fifth part) of 
the aqueous solution of the sodium salt in an ice-salt bath and carefully neutralise by 
adding concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 20 ml) with vigorous stirring, keeping 
the temperature below 15°C. During the addition, the resulting slurry becomes diffi- 
cult to stir efficiently; filter off the solid product at this stage and continue to neutralise 
the filtrate to obtain the remainder of the crude monoxime. The pale brown solid thus 
obtained contains some sodium chloride; crystallisation from water gives almost 
colourless crystals, m.p. 73-74 °C. 

(2) If the product is coloured, dissolve it in 2 m sodium hydroxide solution on a water 
bath. Filter the hot almost saturated solution, and to the hot filtrate add a concen- 
trated solution of ammonium chloride in excess of the amount required to precipitate 
all the dimethylglyoxime, i.e. employ an amount greater than the equivalent of the 
sodium hydroxide used. Filter at once with suction, and wash with boiling water. 
Recrystallise the white product from rectified spirit.

vacuum to give a small forerun of starting material (0.14g) followed by 1- 
phenylpentane-l,2-dione. The yield is 1.98 g (81%), b.p. 108-1 10 °C/

5.9.2 1,3 DICARBONYL COMPOUNDS 

The disconnection strategies shown in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 suggest the acylation 
of a ketone, in either the a-carbanion (7) or enol (8) [or specific enol equivalent 
(9)] forms, as a route to a 1,3-diketone.

The acylating reagent may be an acid chloride or an acid anhydride. Symmet- 
rical ketones ( — CP^R 1 = R 2 ) yield only a single regioisomer. Thus acetone or 
cyclohexanone may be acylated with acetic anhydride in the presence of boron 
trifluoride-etherate to pentane-2,4-dione and 2-acetylcyclohexanone respect- 
ively (Expt 5.102). Both diketones are present in the reaction mixture as boron 
difluoride complexes [(10) and (11) respectively], from which they may be 
released by treatment with sodium acetate. Pentane-2,4-dione is appreciably 
water soluble and is isolated by means of its characteristic copper complex (12).

With unsymmetrical ketones the boron trifluoride catalysed reaction gives a 
mixture of regioisomers, although acylation appears to occur chiefly at the more 
highly substituted of the two alternative a-carbons.

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.9 



Acylation of ketones with esters requires the presence of a strong base under 
anhydrous conditions. Ketones where only one unique mesomeric carbanion is 
formed (e.g. symmetrical ketones or alkyl aryl ketones) yield a single regio- 
isomer. The reaction is illustrated by the formation of benzoylacetone from 
acetophenone and ethyl acetate (Expt 5.103), and may be outlined mechanistic- 
ally as follows:

Fit a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a gas inlet tube and a gas outlet leading to 
a gas absorption device (Fig. 2.61) charged with aqueous alkali to trap excess 
boron trifluoride, and stopper the third neck. Place 58 g (73 ml, 1 mol) of 
pure, anhydrous acetone (Section 4. 1 .21, p. 407) and 255 g (236 ml, 2.5 mol) of 
acetic anhydride in the flask and cool in a freezing mixture of ice and salt. 
Connect the gas inlet tube through an empty wash-bottle to a cylinder of 
commercial boron trifluoride (CAUTION: see Section 4.2.8, p. 421), and 
bubble the gas through the reaction mixture at such a rate that 250 g is 
absorbed in about 5 hours (2 bubbles per second). Pour the reaction mixture 
into a solution of 400 g of crystallised sodium acetate in 800 ml of water con- 
tained in a 2.5-litre round-bottomed flask. Steam distil the mixture (Fig. 
2.102), and collect the distillate in the following portions; 500 ml, 250 ml and 
250 ml. In the meantime prepare a solution of 120g of pure crystallised 
copper(n) acetate in 1500 ml of water at about 85 °C; if the solution is not 
clear, filter from any basic acetate. Precipitate the copper complex of acetyl- 
acetone by adding 700 ml of the hot copper(n) acetate solution to the first 
portion of the steam distillate, 350 ml to the second, 250 ml to the third and 
200 ml to the fourth portion. Allow to stand for 3 hours, or better overnight, 
in the ice chest. Filter off the salt at the pump, wash once with water and suck 
as dry as possible. Transfer the copper complex to a separatory funnel, add 
400 ml of 20 per cent by weight sulphuric acid and 400 ml of ether, and shake. 
Remove the ether layer. Extract the aqueous layer with two 150 ml portions 
of ether. Dry the combined extracts with 125 g of anhydrous sodium sulphate 
(or the equivalent quantity of magnesium sulphate), and distil off the ether. 
Distil the residue through a short fractionating column and collect the acetyl- 
acetone at 134-136°C. The yield is 80 g (80%).

Cognate preparations. 2-Acetylcyclohexanone. Place a mixture of 24.5 g 
(0.25 mol) of cyclohexanone (regenerated from the bisulphite compound) and 
51 g (47.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of acetic anhydride in a 500-ml three-necked flask, 
fitted with an efficient sealed stirrer, a gas inlet tube reaching to within 1-2 cm 
of the surface of the liquid, and in the third neck a thermometer immersed in 
the liquid, combined with a gas outlet tube leading to a trap (1). Immerse the 
flask in a bath of Cardice-acetone, stir the mixture vigorously and pass in the 
boron trifluoride as fast as possible (10-20 minutes) until the mixture, kept at 
0-10 °C, is saturated (copious evolution of white fumes when the outlet tube 
is disconnected from the trap). Replace the Cardice-acetone bath by an ice 
bath and pass the gas in at a slower rate to ensure maximum absorption. Stir 
for 3.5 hours while allowing the ice bath to attain room temperature slowly. 
Pour the reaction mixture into a solution of 136g of hydrated sodium acetate 
in 250 ml of water, reflux for 60 minutes (or until the boron fluoride com- 
plexes are hydrolysed), cool in ice and extract with three 50 ml portions of 
light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C (2), wash the combined extracts free of acid 
with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, dry over anhydrous calcium sul- 
phate, remove the solvent by flash distillation and distil the residue under 
reduced pressure. Collect the 2-acetylcyclohexanone at 95-97 °C/10mmHg. 
The yield is 27 g (77%). 

Notes. (1) Alternatively the reaction may be effected by adding the ketone and the 
acetic anhydride to lOOg (0.75 mol) of a 1:1 acetic acid-boron trifluoride complex 
(Section 4.2.5, p. 421). 

(2) Light petroleum is preferable to ether because it removes smaller amounts of acetic 
acid from the aqueous phase.

Sodium ethoxide. Prepare a suspension of 1 1.5 g (0.5 mol) of granulated 
sodium (Section 4.2.68, p. 462) in 75 ml of dry xylene, transfer it to a 1-litre 
three-necked flask, and decant the xylene. Wash the sodium by decantation 
with two 20 ml portions of dry ether and cover with 200 ml of dry ether. Set 
the flask on a water bath and fit it with a sealed stirrer unit, and with a reflux 
condenser and a dropping funnel, each protected by a calcium chloride 
guard-tube. Start the stirrer and run in 23 g (29 ml, 0.5 mol) of absolute 
ethanol from the dropping funnel during 1-2 hours with gentle refluxing, and 
continue to reflux the mixture with stirring until nearly all of the sodium has 
reacted (up to 6 hours; a little residual sodium does no harm). Stop the stirrer, 
set the condenser for downward distillation and distil off the ether as com- 
pletely as possible. The residual sodium ethoxide should be white and finely 
divided. All moisture must be excluded during the preparation. 

Benzoylacetone. Return the condenser (protected by the calcium chloride 
guard-tube) to the reflux position, surround the flask with ice and introduce 
200 ml (2 mol) of pure, dry ethyl acetate (Section 4.1.24, p. 409). Start the 
stirrer and add 60 g (58 ml, 0.5 mol) of acetophenone from the dropping 
funnel; the reaction commences with the separation of the sodium salt of

ice box overnight. Filter the solid at the pump with the aid of the addition of a 
little dry ether. Dissolve the air-dried solid in cold water, and acidify the solu- 
tion with acetic acid. Filter off the crude benzoylacetone, and dry in the air. 
Purify by distillation under reduced pressure; collect the benzoylacetone at 
128-130 °C/10mmHg. It solidifies on cooling to a colourless crystalline solid, 
m.p. 61 °C. The yield is 50 g (62%). Record the p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 )

of symmetrical 1,4-diketones from 1,3- (or /?-)keto esters (Expt 5.104), and (b) a

(Expt 5.105). The synthesis of symmetrical 1,4-diketones from the sodio derivat-

The resulting diacylsuccinate ester is subjected to hydrolysis and decarboxyla- 
tion by heating with aqueous potassium carbonate (cf. Section 5.14.3, p. 738). 
The reaction is illustrated by the preparation of hexane-2,5-dione (Expt 5.104). 
The synthesis of unsymmetrical 1,4-diketones results from the conjugate 
addition of the nitronate anion (as the acyl anion equivalent) to an a, fi- 
unsaturated ketone [Method (fo)]. l47a The intermediate nitroketone is converted 
into the diketone by reduction with titanium(m) chloride at pH 1, or by ozono- 
lysis of the nitronate anion 147b (cf. Section 5.7.7, p. 599).

Reduction of nitroketones with titanium(m) chloride at pH 1. The foregoing

chloric acid solution) and stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 24 
hours. The reaction mixture is then poured into ether and the phases separ- 
ated. The aqueous phase is extracted several times with ether; the organic 
extracts are combined, washed with 5 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate 
and with brine, and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, concen- 
trated and distilled. The yield of heptane-2,5-dione is 66 per cent; p.m.r. spec- 
trum (CC1 4 , TMS) S 1.00 (t, 3H), 2.10 (s, 3H), 2.60 (s, 4H) and 3.41 (q, 2H). 

Note. (1) A 20 per cent titanium(m) chloride solution in aqueous hydrochloric acid is 
available commercially. Solid titanium(m) chloride reagent is a flammable solid and 
should be handled only under an inert atmosphere, and if used in this reaction should 
be taken from a fresh bottle. 

5.10 CARBOHYDRATES 

The simplest carbohydrates are the monosaccharides which under specified con- 
ditions are structurally characterised as polyhydroxy aldehydes or polyhydroxy 
ketones; these are termed aldoses and ketoses respectively. Aldoses and ketoses 
are sub-classified, according to the number of carbons present in each molecule, 
into aldotetroses, aldopentoses, aldohexoses, etc., or ketotetroses, ketopentoses, 
etc. 

The monosaccharides are the fundamental units for more complex carbo- 
hydrates. Thus disaccharides are compounds which yield two monosaccharide 
molecules upon dilute acid hydrolysis; trisaccharides given three monosacchar- 
ides upon hydrolysis; tetrasaccharides give four monosaccharide molecules, etc. 
The upper limit in this group (the oligosaccharides) is reached in the case of a 
polymer having ten monosaccharide units. Mono- and oligosaccharides are 
characterised by having an invariable molecular weight and high water solubil- 
ity; they are usually sweet to taste and are frequently known as sugars. The non- 
sugar group of carbohydrates are polymers (polysaccharides) having more 
numerous monosaccharide units and the molecular weights of individual mole- 
cules in a given sample will not necessarily be of the same magnitude; acid 
hydrolysis yields the appropriate number of monosaccharide units. 

The wide availability of various polysaccharides provides an important 
source of some of the monosaccharides. Such monosaccharides are now used in 
organic reactions as low-cost starting materials in the synthesis of a range of 
simpler optically pure compounds (e.g. Expt 5.77). These synthetic strategies 
have been made possible from earlier work on the development of numerous 
selective protection methods, on the application of new selective reagents for 
functional group modification within the monosaccharide molecule, and on the 
realisation of the role of conformation in the interpretation of a reaction course. 
The preparative examples in this section are illustrative of these developments.

The structural relationships of the aldoses and ketoses are exemplified in 
Tables 5.4 and 5.5 respectively. The structures are formulated as Fischer projec- 
tions to illustrate the convention d- (or L-) which is used to designate the con- 
figuration at the chiral site furthest from the carbonyl function. When the 
hydroxyl group at this site lies on the right side of the Fischer projection formula 
the molecule belongs to the D-series of monosaccharides and is related to d- 
glyceraldehyde. The L-series are mirror images of these structures. The tables 
also illustrate the epimeric relationships between the various structures. Thus 
erythrose and threose are C-2-epimers (i.e. of opposite configuration at C-2), as 
are the pairs ribose/arabinose; xylose/lyxose; allose/altrose; glucose/mannose; 
gulose/idose; and galactose/talose. Glucose and allose are C-3 epimers; glucose 
and galactose are C-4 epimers, etc. 

Fischer projections are however, unsatisfactory when considering the phys- 
ical properties and chemical reactivity of monosaccharides for which definitive 
spatial formulations are necessary. These are given below for D-glyceraldehyde, 
D-erythrose and D-threose, for which the (/?,S)-configuration may be readily 
assigned at the appropriate chiral carbons.

mixture of five forms. The cyclic structures are those which arise from hemi- 
acetal formation involving the carbonyl function of C-l of the open-chain form 
(ia/b) with either (i) the hydroxyl group on C-5 (in 3a) to give two pyranose ring 
structures (1), a, D-glucopyranose, and (2), /?-D-glucopyranose, or (ii) the 
hydroxyl group on C-4 (in 3b) to give two furanose structures (4), a-D-gluco- 
furanose, and (5) /?-D-glucofuranose. The open-chain structure has been drawn 
to emphasise the spatial relationships of the carbon-skeletal arrangement and 
the dispositions of the hydroxyl groups for hemi-acetal formation. The five- 
membered (furanose) ring structure is at right angles to the plane of the paper. 
The pyranose structure adopts the characteristic chair conformation of six- 
membered rings. 

Structures (1) and (2) differ from one another only in the configuration at the 
anomeric carbon atom (C-l), the hydroxyl group being axial (a) in (1) and equa- 
torial (/?) in (2). In the case of structures (3) and (4) the configuration at the 
anomeric carbon is that in which the hydroxyl group lies either below (a) [in 
(4)], or above (/?) [in (5)] the general plane of the ring. In solution the equilib- 
rium ratio of the four cyclic and the acyclic structures is dependent upon the 
nature of the solvent; in aqueous solution at room temperature the percentage 
composition is (1), 36 per cent; (2), 64 per cent; (3), 0.0026 per cent; (4) + (5), &lt; 1 
per cent. The composition reflects the relative thermodynamic stabilities of the 
relevant molecules under these conditions. The change in optical rotation which 
is observed when crystalline a-D-glucopyranose is dissolved in a solvent, and 
which results from the attainment of this equilibrium is termed mutarotation. 

X-ray crystallographic studies have shown that crystalline D-glucose as com- 
monly isolated exists in the a-D-glucopyranose form. Furthermore the stable 
chair conformation (1), in which the hydroxyl groups on C-2, C-3 and C-4, and 
the hydroxymethyl group on C-5 are equatorial, is preferred to the alternative 
chair conformation (6) in which these groups occupy axial positions.

There has been a considerable amount of discussion over recent years on the 
nomenclature to be used to describe the various conformations which these ring

saccharides exist in the pyranose structure. Each in solution, as with D-glucose, 
exists as an equilibrium mixture of open chain and of a- and /?-anomers of the 
cyclic forms. The cyclic five- and six-membered structures formulated below are 
an illustrative selection of monosaccharides.

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.10 



The hydroxyl groups at both the anomeric and non-anomeric carbon atoms 
may be readily acylated. For example, treatment of D-glucose with acetic 
anhydride in the presence of zinc chloride gives a reasonable yield of the penta- 
acetate, 1, 2,3,4, 6-penta-O-acetyl-oe-D-glucopyranose (8) (Expt 5.106). On the 
other hand the /?-anomer (7) predominates when D-glucose is treated with acetic 
anhydride in the presence of sodium acetate (Expt 5.107). Interestingly the 
/?-anomer may be converted into the a-anomer by heating with an acetic 
anhydride/zinc chloride mixture. These reactions are reasonably interpreted on 
the basis that the /?-anomer is the kinetically controlled product, being initially 
formed from the more rapid acetylation of the equatorial hydroxyl group at C-l 
of /?-D-glucopyranose. In the presence of the Lewis acid catalyst, zinc chloride, 
the /?-penta-acetate (7) is thought to be readily converted into the mesomerically 
stabilised carbocation (12) by loss of the C-1-acetoxy group, which would then 
recombine to yield the thermodynamically more stable a-anomer (8). 




Sodium acetate would not be expected to promote the formation of the species 
(12) and hence the /?-anomer would accumulate if this catalyst were used. 

D-Glucose may be benzoylated with benzoyl chloride in pyridine/chloroform 
solution (Expt 5.108). Here temperature control is essential to prevent the 
formation of an anomeric mixture. 

The acetate (or benzoate) groups attached to the anomeric site may be read- 
ily replaced by a bromine atom to yield the synthetically useful acyglycosyl 
halides. Thus the formation of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-a-D-glucopyranosyl bro- 
mide (9) from D-glucose involves the formation of the mixed penta-acetates (7) 
and (8) followed by treatment of the reaction mixture with hydrogen bromide 
generated in situ from red phosphorus, bromine and water (Expt 5.109). Altern- 
atively a solution of hydrogen bromide in glacial acetic acid is added to a solu- 
tion of the acetylated or benzoylated monosaccharide (e.g. Expt 5.110, the 
preparation of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzoyl-oe-D-glucopyranosyl bromide). In either 
case the thermodynamically more stable anomer is formed. In the case of glu- 
cose (and of the other aldohexoses together with xylose and lyxose) this is the oe- 
anomer, while in the case of arabinose and ribose the /?-anomer predominates. 

The halogen in the acylglycosyl halide is reactive and may be readily dis- 
placed, for example, by an alkoxy group on reaction with an alcohol under 
anhydrous conditions in the presence of a silver or mercury(n) salt. In this case 
the products are glycosides which are the mixed cyclic acetals related to the 
cyclic hemiacetal forms of the monosaccharides. In the case of the D-glucose 
derivative shown below (and of other 1,2-cis acylglycosyl halides) the replace- 

643 



5.10 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ment involves inversion of configuration at the anomeric site and the a-glucosyl 
halide (9) yields a /?-glucoside (10) (e.g. the formation of methyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O- 
acetyl-/?-D-glucopyranoside, Expt 5.111). 

The presence of the protecting acyl groups in the acylglycosyl halide ensures 
that the pyranose ring structure is retained. After glycoside formation, removal 
of these protecting groups (either acetyl or benzoyl) is readily effected by base 
(e.g. Zemplen's method which uses methanol containing a small amount of 
sodium methoxide) to give the alkali-stable glycoside (e.g. methyl /?-D-gluco- 
pyranoside (11), (Expt 5.112).

OH OMe 

a-D-galactose (13) methyl a-D-galactopyranostde ( 14) 

The above, indirect, procedure for glycoside synthesis is the Koenigs-Knorr 
method. Glycosidation may be effected from monosaccharides directly by treat- 
ment with an alcohol in the presence of a mineral acid catalyst. For example, 
when a-D-galactose (13) is heated in methanolic solution containing 2 per cent of 
hydrogen chloride the thermodymanically more stable methyl a-D-galacto- 
pyranoside (14) (Expt 5.113) is formed preferentially, and may be isolated from 
the reaction product by crystallisation as the monohydrate. The less abundant 
/?-anomer may be recovered from the mother-liquors. 

The commercially available methyl a-D-glucopyranoside may be obtained 
similarly. If however the glycosidation reaction of D-glucose is conducted at 
room temperature with a lower proportion of mineral acid, then the predomin- 
ant products are the methyl a(and /?)-D-glucofuranosides. It is considered that 
the furanosides are the products arising from kinetic control and the pyra- 
nosides from thermodynamic control. Clearly the composition of reaction mix- 
tures arising from glycosidation of other monosaccharides will be dependent 
upon the nature of the monosaccharide and the proportions may be rationalised 
by the application of conformational analysis. 150

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.10 



Add slowly 2.5 g (0.014 mol) of powdered a-glucose, shaking the mixture 
gently during the addition to control the vigorous reaction which ensues. 
Finally heat the flask for 1 hour on a boiling water bath (2). Pour the contents 
of the flask into 125 ml of ice-water and stir vigorously to assist the hydrolysis 
of unreacted acetic anhydride. After about 30 minutes the oil which first separ- 
ates will gradually solidify. Filter, wash well with cold water and recrystallise 
several times from industrial spirit until the m.p. is constant. The pure prod- 
uct melts at 110-111 °C; the yield is 3.5 g (63%). 

Method B. To a mixture of 16.25g (15ml, 0.16mol) of acetic anhydride and 
25 ml of glacial acetic acid in a conical flask add 5 g (0.028 mol) of powdered 
glucose. Add dropwise (Pasteur pipette) and with shaking 1 ml of perchloric 
acid-acetic anhydride catalyst (3), at such a rate that the temperature of the 
mixture does not exceed 35 °C. Leave at room temperature for 30 minutes and 
then pour the liquid into a mixture of ice and water. Filter off the crystalline 
solid which separates on vigorous stirring and wash it thoroughly with cold 
water. Recrystallise from industrial spirit until the m.p. is constant; the pure 
product has m.p. 110-111 °C, [a]f&gt; 8 + 101.6° (cO.28 in CHC1 3 ). The yield is 
8g(72%). 

Notes. (1) Zinc chloride is extremely deliquescent and it must therefore be introduced 
into the flask as rapidly as possible. Place a small stick of zinc chloride in a glass 
mortar, powder rapidly, and weigh out the required amount. 

(2) Although the time of heating may be reduced to 30 minutes by heating in an air 
bath the product is somewhat discoloured and requires at least one recrystallisation 
involving the use of decolourising charcoal. 

(3) The perchloric acid-acetic anhydride catalyst may be prepared by adding 1 .0 g of 
60 per cent perchloric acid to 2.3 g of acetic anhydride maintained at °C.

from time to time. Continue heating for a further 2 hours after a clear solution 
has been obtained and then pour the reaction mixture on to 250 ml of crushed

solve the solid. Add 5 g of pure /?-D-glucose penta-acetate, continue heating 
for 30 minutes, pour the mixture on to ice and purify the solid which separ- 
ates as described above. The effectiveness of the conversion may be moni- 
tored by t.l.c. on silica gel plates using cyclohexane/acetone (7:3) and locating 
the two closely running spots by immersing the developed and dried plate in a 
tank of iodine vapour. 

Note. (1) It is dangerous to scale up this experiment without modifying the prepara- 
tive procedure. If 50 g of glucose is to be acetylated, a 2-litre round-bottomed flask 
should be fitted with two wide-bore Liebig condensers in series, and a large vessel 
filled with ice-water should be readily available to plunge the reaction flask into, 
should the vigorous reaction which ensues on heating need controlling. With a scale 
using 100 g of glucose a procedure involving the addition of a-D-glucose to a pre- 
heated sodium acetate-acetic anhydric mixture at such a rate as to keep the mixture 
under reflux but without the reaction getting out of control has been described. 151

In a 1 -litre flange flask fitted with a multiple socket head carrying a mechan-

dichloromethane. Cool the flask well in an ice-salt bath and add from the 
dropping funnel, with stirring, a previously prepared and cooled solution of 
127 g (105 ml, 0.9 mol) of benzoyl chloride in 105 ml of dry dichloromethane. 
Remove the dropping funnel and add 50 g (0.28 mol) of dry powdered a-D- 
glucose portionwise to the vigorously stirred benzoylating reagent at a rate 
which maintains the temperature of the reaction below 10 °C (1). Allow the 
pink-coloured solution to stand at °C for 24 hours, dilute with 400 ml of 
dichloromethane and transfer the solution to a 2-litre separatory funnel. 
Wash the solution successively with several 300 ml portions of dilute aqueous 
sulphuric acid (2 m), water, saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate 
and water. Dry over anhydrous sodium sulphate and remove the dichloro- 
methane on a rotary evaporator to give a yellow solid which is ground up 
with industrial spirit, filtered and washed well with spirit. Recrystallise the 
solid from acetone-water to give the pure product, m.p. 184-186 °C, [a]o° +

Note. (1) When the experiment is performed without effective cooling, i.e. if the tem- 
perature rises to 40-50 °C, a mixture of anomers is obtained which cannot be separ- 
ated by simple recrystallisation. Frequently in large-scale preparations it is advisable 
to replace the ice-salt bath with one of acetone-Cardice to ensure good temperature 
control.

Fit a 1 -litre three-necked flask located in the fume cupboard with a mechan-

mometer to read the temperature of the reaction mixture. Immerse the flask 
in an ice-salt bath supported on a laboratory jack so that it may be easily 
removed if the reaction conditions so demand. Place 432 g (400 ml, 4.24 mol) 
of acetic anhydride in the flask, cool to 4 °C and add dropwise and with stir- 
ring 2.4 ml of 60 per cent perchloric acid. Remove the cooling bath and allow 
the reaction mixture to warm to room temperature; then add lOOg (0.56 mol) 
of dry powdered a-D-glucose in portions with stirring so that the temperature 
of the reaction mixture is maintained at between 30 and 40 °C. Cool to about 
20°C and add 31 g (1 mol) of red phosphorus followed by 181 g (58ml, 
2.26 mol) of bromine (CAUTION) dropwise at a rate that the temperature 
does not exceed 20 °C. Then add 36 ml of water over a period of about half an 
hour, the stirring and cooling being continued and the temperature being 
maintained below 20 °C. Allow the reaction mixture to stand for 2 hours at 
room temperature, transfer to a fume cupboard and dilute with 300 ml of 
dichloromethane, and filter through a large 60° glass funnel having a glass 
wool plug inserted not too tightly into the outlet (1). Finally rinse the reac- 
tion flask and funnel with small portions of dichloromethane, transfer the fil- 
trate and washings to a 3-litre separatory funnel and wash it rapidly by 
shaking vigorously with two 800 ml portions of iced water (2). Run the lower 
dichloromethane layer from the second washing into 500 ml of a stirred satur- 
ated solution of aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate to which has also been 
added some crushed ice. When the vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide has 
subsided transfer the mixture to a separatory funnel, run the dichlorometh- 
ane layer into a large flask containing 10 g of powdered activated silica gel 
and filter after about 10 minutes (the bulk of the solution may be decanted 
from the silica gel and the remainder filtered under reduced pressure using a 
sintered glass funnel). Remove the solvent under reduced pressure using a 
rotary evaporator on a water bath maintained at 60 °C. Towards the conclu- 
sion of this operation the syrupy mass crystallises as a thick layer around the 
inside of the flask. At this stage remove the flask from the evaporator, break 
the crystalline cake away from the sides of the flask and remove the remaining 
solvent under reduced pressure without heating further. Transfer portions of 
the solid to a mortar and grind with a 2:1 mixture of light petroleum (b.p. 40- 
60 °C) and dry ether. Filter the combined slurry and wash the filter cake first 
with a light petroleum-ether solvent mixture and then with 50 ml of pre- 
viously chilled (0°C) dry ether. The crude product is obtained in a yield of 
210 g (92%), and when recrystallised from ether-light petroleum (b.p. 40- 
60 °C) has m.p. 88-89 °C, [a]£ + 197.5° (c2 in CHC1 3 ). The glucosyl halide 
should be stored in a desiccator over sodium hydroxide pellets; whenever 
possible it should be used without delay.

5.1 D PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Notes. (1) If care is used most of the solution may be decanted from the solid deposit 
so that the glass wool does not become blocked with material and hence slow down 
the filtration process. This filtration is best conducted in a fume cupboard. 
(2) All the isolation operations must be conducted with the minimum of delay and 
under conditions which reduce the contact of the solutions of unstable glucosyl halide 
with moisture. Solutions to be used for washing the organic layer should have been 
previously prepared and contain sufficient ice to ensure that the temperature of the 
liquid is approximately 4 °C. To obtain good yields and to ensure that vessels do not 
become unduly 'sticky' as the result of residual carbohydrate deposits, the separatory 
funnels, receiver vessels and aqueous extracts before being discarded should be rinsed 
with dichloromethane at each stage and these washings combined with the main 
organic solution.

(5.8 ml, 0.226 mol) of bromine and 3.6 ml of water. The yellow syrup which is 
obtained after the appropriate isolation procedure gives 21 g of crude crystal-

prepare initially a smaller volume of a more concentrated solution and dilute it to the 
appropriate concentration with dry methanol. The aliquot portions (say 5 ml) should 
be diluted with distilled water (20 ml) before titration.

cation of neutralisation.

Reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with two molar proportions of a monohydric 
alcohol or with one molar proportion of a 1,2- or 1,3-diol in the presence of an 
acid catalyst yields an acetal (23) or cyclic acetal (24) or (25) respectively (see 
methods of protection, Section 5.4.6, p. 553, and Section 5.8.8, p. 624).

The formation of acetals of the type (24) and (25) is an important reaction in the 
monosaccharide series. In general, ketones react with vicinal diol groups to give 
the five-membered cyclic products, and aldehydes react with 1,3-diols to give the 
six-membered cyclic products (see Section 5.10.4), although exceptions can be 
found with suitable, partially protected, monosaccharide derivatives. An 
example of the reaction of a monosaccharide with a ketone is the formation of 
l,2:5,6-di-0-cyclohexylidene-a-D-glucofuranose (17) from D-glucose (15) and 
cyclohexanone in the presence of sulphuric acid (Expt 5.1 14). The formation of a 
furanose derivative in this case is promoted by the two favourable vicinal diol 
groups which are present in a-D-glucofuranose (4) (note the ds-orientation of 
the hydroxyl groups at C-l and C-2), whereas there is only one vicinal ds-diol 
grouping in a-D-glucopyranose. Furthermore fusion of the five-membered acetal 
ring to the six-membered monosaccharide ring in (1) would be expected to in- 
troduce considerable ring strain. Reaction of D-glucose with acetone in the pres- 
ence of zinc chloride and phosphoric acid gives the corresponding 
diisopropylidene derivative (16). 

This reaction offers a convenient route to glucofuranose derivatives, particu- 
larly because the 5,6-acetal group may be selectively cleaved by hydrolysis to 
give the 1,2-mono acetal derivative (20) (Expt 5.115). The reaction conditions 
need to be carefully controlled to avoid extensive hydrolysis to the parent sugar. 
This is particularly important with the partial hydrolysis of 3-0-benzyl-l,2:5,6- 
di-O-cyclohexylidene-a-D-glucofuranose (cognate preparation in Expt 5.115), 
since the product (21) is then contaminated with 3-O-benzyl-D-glucose. Purifica- 
tion of the hydrolysis product, 3-0-benzyl-l,2-0-cyclohexylidene-oe-D- 
glucofuranose (21), may be effected by column chromatography or by conver- 
sion of it into the more readily purified crystalline 5,6-dibenzoate derivative; the 
acyl groups may be then removed by the Zemplen method. The conversion of 
l,2:5,6-di-0-cyclohexylidene-a-D-glucofuranose (17) into its 3-O-benzyl derivat- 
ive (19) has been included (Expt 5.116) to illustrate the protection of hydroxyl 
groups in monosaccharides by conversion into ethers. The benzylation is 
effected by heating the diacetal with benzyl chloride in the presence of sodium 
hydroxide under PTC conditions. The formation of a benzyl ether is useful in 
synthetic interconversions with monosaccharides since it is easily and selectively 
cleaved by catalytic hydrogenolysis. Other means for the protection of hydroxyl 
groups include their conversion into methyl ethers (Expt 5.121), trimethylsilyl 

652 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.10 



ethers (see Section 5.4.6, p. 552), triphenylmethyl ethers and allyl ethers (see Sec- 
tion 5.4.6, p. 551). 

The preparation of 1,2-O-cyclohexylidene-oe-D-xylofuranose (22) (Expt 5.117) 
from 1,2-O-cyclohexylidene-oe-D-glucofuranose illustrates the use of sodium 
metaperiodate for the cleavage of carbon-carbon bonds in a-diols (see also 
Section 4.2.55, p. 454). In this case C-6 is lost as formaldehyde and C-5 is con- 
verted into an aldehyde group. This aldehydic product is isolated as a dimer, 
which is then reduced in methanol solution with sodium borohydride to the 
xylofuranose derivative (22). 

The oxidation of the C-3-hydroxyl group in l,2:5,6-di-0-isopropylidene-a-D- 
glucofuranose (16), with pyridinium chlorochromate, to a keto group (18) is a 
further example of the usefulness of recent oxidising agents for effecting func- 
tional group modification under mild conditions. 1 52 This keto-sugar derivative, 
and similar analogues, have become of importance for the development of syn- 
thetic routes to branched-chain monosaccharides (by reaction with organo- 
metallic reagents) and to rare monosaccharides by reduction with suitable 
reagents.

Fit a 3-litre flange flask with a multiple socket head carrying a mechanical 
stirrer capable of effecting vigorous agitation, a calcium chloride guard-tube, 
a 100-ml dropping funnel and a stoppered opening wide enough to allow for 
the addition of solid. Immerse the flask in a large plastic or metal container 
filled with an intimate mixture of ice and salt. Add 1000 g (1050 ml, lOmol) of 
redistilled cyclohexanone to the flask and cool to °C. Charge the separatory 
funnel with 62.5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and run the acid slowly 
into the vigorously stirred cyclohexanone; the final solution should be a light 
straw colour. Add slowly and portionwise with continued vigorous stirring 
450 g (2.5 mol) of finely powdered dried a-D-glucose (1). Remove the cooling 
bath and allow the reaction mixture to reach ambient temperature with con- 
tinual stirring; over a period of 8 hours the reaction mixture becomes pro- 
gressively more viscous and finally sets into a solid off-white crystalline mass. 
Some caution should be exercised to prevent the stirrer motor from being 
overstrained. Allow the reaction mixture to stand at room temperature over- 
night, break up the crystalline mass, add 750 ml of heptane and a solution of 
124 g of sodium carbonate in 375 ml of water, and heat on a boiling water 
bath with vigorous stirring. Decant as much of the upper heptane layer as 
possible from undissolved solid. Add a further 750 ml portion of heptane to 
the residue and heat under reflux until the remainder of the solid dissolves; 
decant the clear heptane layer and cool the combined heptane extracts in the 
refrigerator. Filter off the crystalline material, m.p. 121-124 °C, and recrystal-

Use from heptane (2) using decolourising charcoal to clear the hot solution of

glucofuranose has m.p. 131-132 °C, [a]£° -2.2° (cl.8 in EtOH); the yield is 
380 g (47%). 

Notes. (1) If adequate cooling and stirring is not employed the final solution is dark 
yellow; furthermore the addition of glucose leads to an unacceptable local rise in tem- 
perature, and the final appearance of the reaction mixture is a dark red intractable oily 
mass. The powdered glucose should be dried in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus 
pentoxide, not in an oven which apparently causes changes on the surface of the glu- 
cose particles which render them unreactive. 
(2) Another solvent for recrystallisation is methylcyclohexane (0.17g/ml). 

Cognate preparations. l,2:4,5-Di-0-cyclohexylidene-D-fructopyranose. Add 

200 g (1.1 1 mol) of finely powdered dry D-fructose with vigorous stirring to 
41 9 g (440 ml, 4.49 mol) of ice-cooled cyclohexanone containing 30 ml of con- 
centrated sulphuric acid; the reaction mixture becomes solid within 30 
minutes. Leave the mixture overnight at room temperature, dissolve the 
product in 500 ml of chloroform and wash the solution with dilute aqueous 
sodium hydroxide, dilute hydrochloric acid and water and finally dry and 
evaporate. Solidify the residue by m.p. 145-156 °C, [oe]£° - 133.5° (c 1 in

l,2:5,6-Di-0-isopropylidene-u-D-glucofuranose. A suspension of 150g 
(0.83 mol) of dry D-glucose, 120 g (0.83 mol) of anhydrous zinc chloride and 
7.5 g of phosphoric acid (88% v/v) in 1 litre of dry acetone is stirred at 
ambient temperature for 30 hours. Unchanged glucose is removed by filtra- 
tion, and inorganic salts are precipitated by the addition of a solution of 85 g 
of sodium hydroxide in 85 ml of water. The resulting suspension is filtered, the 
residue washed with acetone and the acetone evaporated. The mass which 
remains is dissolved in 200 ml of water and extracted with five 100-ml por- 
tions of dichloromethane. The organic phase is dried and evaporated on a 
rotary evaporator. Recrystallisation from light petroleum (b.p. 80-100 °C) 
gives 70g of product, m.p. 109-1 10°C, [a]£° -18.5° (c5 in H 2 0). 

l,2:5,6-Di-0-isopropylidene-D-mannitol. To a solution of 60 g of zinc chlor- 
ide in 300 ml of acetone is added 10 g of finely powdered D-mannitol. The 
mixture is stirred vigorously at 20 °C until solution is complete (2-3 hours) 
and then allowed to stand for 16 hours. The reaction mixture is then poured 
into a solution of 70 g of potassium carbonate in 70 ml of water which is 
covered with 300 ml of ether. The mixture is stirred for half-an-hour when the 
organic layer is filtered from the agglomerated pellets of zinc carbonate. The 
latter is washed with 100 ml of 1:1 acetone-ether solution, and the combined 
filtrates evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The dry residue is suc- 
cessively extracted with five 250-ml portions of boiling light petroleum (b.p. 
60-80 °C) and the combined filtrates slowly cooled to give the product, 7.9 g 
(55%), having m.p. 119°C.

purposes. However t.l.c. analysis on silica gel plates (solvent system; benzene- 
methanol 9:1) (CAUTION) reveals one major and two minor components. 
Purification may be effected by either of the two methods described below. 

Chromatographic purification of 3-O-benzyl-l ,2-O-cyclohexylidene-a-D-gluco-

with benzene and collect suitable-sized fractions; evaporate the solvent from

required product. Evaporate the methanol and distil the residual syrup using 
a molecular still; about 50 per cent recovery of the purified product may be 
expected. 

Purification of 3-0-benzyl-l,2-0-cyclohexylidene-a-D-glucofuranose by 
benzoylation. Dissolve 5 g of the crude product in 10 ml of pure dry pyridine 
and add 5 g of benzoyl chloride. Leave the reaction mixture overnight at 
room temperature, pour it on to ice and stir thoroughly. Extract the oil which 
separates into 50 ml of dichloromethane and wash the dichloromethane solu- 
tion successively with 30 ml of ice-cold dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid 
(2 m), 30 ml of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 2 x 30 ml 
of water. Dry over sodium sulphate and evaporate the dichloromethane. The 
viscous oil crystallises on trituration with methanol and is recrystallised from 
methanol to give the pure derivative 5,6-di-0-benzoyl-3-0-benzyl- 1,2-0- 
cyclohexylidene-oe-D-glucofuranose, m.p. 104-106 °C, [a]o° — 26.4° (c 1 in

Distil the resulting colourless oil in a molecular still to obtain chromato-

combined extracts over magnesium sulphate and remove the solvent by evap- 
oration under reduced pressure to give a viscous oil which crystallises on tri-

Note. (l)The progress of the oxidation may be followed by iodimetry. In this method

This sequence serves to exemplify the formation and aspects of reactivity of 
toluene-p-sulphonate esters in monosaccharide systems, and further to illustrate 
the selective protection afforded to hydroxyl groups by the formation of cyclic 
acetals by reaction with carbonyl compounds. Thus reaction of methyl oe-D- 
glucopyranoside (26) with benzaldehyde in the presence of zinc chloride gives 
the 4,6-acetal (27) (Expt 5.118), wherein two fused six-membered rings of the 
frans-decalin type are present. As a cognate preparation the reaction of benz- 
aldehyde with methyl a-D-galactopyranoside results in a similar conversion to a 
4,6-acetal, but in this case the product is the conformationally flexible system of 
the cis-decalin type, the most likely conformation being that shown below.

Since the 4,6-acetal grouping and the glycosidic grouping (27) are stable under 
basic conditions, though unstable in the presence of acid, the remaining two 
hydroxyl groups may be suitably protected by reactions that are base catalysed. 
Thus (27) may be converted into the 2,3-di-O-toluene-p-sulphonyl derivative 
(28) by reaction with toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride in the presence of pyridine 
(Expt 5.119); this reaction is analogous to the formation of sulphonate esters of 
alcohols or phenols. 

R-CH 2 OH + ClS0 2 -C 6 H 4 -Me &gt; R-CH 2 -OS0 2 -C 6 H 4 -Me 

The value of the sulphonate esters in carbohydrate chemistry lies in their ability 
to undergo cleavage by reaction with nucleophiles in one of two possible ways, 
(i) cleavage of the S — O bond with regeneration of the hydroxyl group as a 
result ofS N 2 attack at the sulphur atom, and (ii) cleavage of the C — O bond as a 
result of S N 2 attack at the carbon atom.

Both these processes are illustrated by the reaction of the 2,3-di-O-toluene-p- 
sulphonyl derivative with sodium methoxide in methanol (Expt 5.120). Here the 
sulphonyloxy group at position 2 undergoes cleavage (i) to yield the anion (31); 
this anionic site then participates in reaction at position 3 whereby cleavage of 
the sulphonyloxy group takes place by pathway (ii) with the formation of an 
oxirane ring system. This neighbouring group effect must proceed via the 
unfavourable boat conformation (32) in order that the stereoelectronic require- 
ments for the reaction of the participating groups be met (i.e. ant i-periplanar).

This reaction has led to an inversion of configuration at C-3 to yield the allose 
derivative (29). Ring opening of the oxirane system by treatment with alkali in 
aqueous media results in regeneration of a 2,3-vicinal diol but having the 
hydroxyl groups in the diaxial orientation, as a result of inversion of configu- 
ration at C-2 (Expt 5.120). Finally the isolation of methyl-a-D-altropyranoside

with dimethyl sulphate in the presence of sodium hydroxide. Selective removal

Notes. (1) Methyl oe-D-glucopyranoside is available commercially and it is not usually

(2) An alternative isolation procedure is to extract the clear solution by shaking it with 
three successive 100 ml portions of light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C), which removes the 
unreacted benzaldehyde more effectively, and then to stir the viscous residue with ice- 
water until solidification occurs.

pressure-equalising funnel protected with a calcium chloride guard-tube 
place a solution of 11.7g (0.0195 mol) of methyl 4,6-0-benzylidene-2,3-di-0- 
toluene-p-sulphonyl-oe-D-glucopyranoside (Expt 5.119) in 150 ml of dichloro-

taining 60 ml (0.6 mol) of 40 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. 
Place 14.1 g (0.05 mol) of methyl 4,6-0-benzylidene-oe-D-glucopyranoside and 
150 ml of acetone in the flask, run in 15 ml of sodium hydroxide solution, 
commence fairly rapid stirring and raise the temperature of the water bath to

The presence of two or more carboxyl groups in a carbon chain gives rise to 
dicarboxylic, tricarboxylic, etc., acids; many of these acids are designated by 
universally recognised and accepted trivial names (see Table 10.20). Unsatur- 
ated acids are considered in Section 5.18.3, p. 804; other functionally substituted 
acids (e.g. hydroxy acids, amino acids, etc.) are considered in Section 5.14. 

The synthesis of aliphatic carboxylic acids is exemplified by the following 
typical procedures. 

1. Oxidative methods (Expts 5.122 to 5.126). 

2. The hydrolysis of alkyl cyanides (Expts 5.127 and 5.128).

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The characteristic profile of the i.r. spectral region (2500-3300 cm -1 ) corres- 
ponding to a broad absorption from the intermolecular bonding of the carboxyl 
group is easily recognised in aliphatic carboxylic acids (hexanoic acid, Fig. 3.31). 
The frequency of absorption arising from the carbonyl group occurs in the 
region 1725- 1700 cm -1 (p. 299). The p.m.r. spectrum of an aliphatic carboxylic 
acid will show a low field signal from the acidic proton, provided that the sample 
is dissolved in a solvent which does not undergo a deuterium exchange reaction. 
The structure of the alkyl group may be assessed from the spin-spin splitting 



666 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.11 



patterns as illustrated in Fig. 3.57. The interpretation of the m.s. of mono- 
carboxylic acids is discussed on p. 379. The u.v -visible spectra of saturated acids 
is not usually structurally informative. Further descriptive spectroscopic 
analyses are included in some of the following preparative examples. 

5.11.1 OXIDATIVE METHODS 

Saturated primary alcohols are readily oxidised to aldehydes, which in turn are 
further oxidised to monocarboxylic acids having the same number of carbon 
atoms. 

R-CH 2 OH &gt; R-CHO &gt; R-C0 2 H 

The reaction is frequently effected using alkaline potassium permanganate solu- 
tion (e.g. Expt 5.122). Aqueous sodium dichromate/sulphuric acid mixtures may 
be used, but yields are not always satisfactory because of the attendant produc- 
tion of appreciable amount of esters (cf. the preparation of aldehydes, Section 
5.7.1, p. 587). 

Secondary alcohols on oxidation give ketones which may be cleaved under 
vigorous oxidative conditions to a mixture of carboxylic acids.

Clearly such a method is of limited preparative value, but an important excep- 
tion is the oxidation of cyclic secondary alcohols which on oxidation with nitric 
acid give good yields of dicarboxylic acids by way of the intermediate cyclic 
ketone, e.g. adipic acid from cyclohexanone, Expt 5.123. 

The oxidation of a methyl ketone to a carboxylic acid can be effected by the 
use of the haloform reaction. This involves treatment of the methyl ketone with 
an alkaline hypohalite reagent. A trihalomethyl ketone is initially formed which 
then undergoes hydrolysis under the basic conditions used.

In the examples given the preparative value depends upon the ready availability 
of the required methyl ketone; thus pinacolone (Expt 5.98), cyclopropyl methyl 
ketone (Expt 7.1) and mesityl oxide (Expt 5.213) are converted into 2,2-dimeth- 
ylpropanoic acid, cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and 3,3-dimethylacrylic acid re- 
spectively (Expts 5.124 and 5.125). 

667 



5.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



A carboxylic acid group is formed when a carbon-carbon multiple bond is 
oxidatively cleaved. The main value of this is as a degradative process in struc- 
tural elucidation, as for example in the ozonolysis of alkenes followed by oxidat- 
ive decomposition of the ozonide (Section 2.17.4). Oxidation of a symmetrical 
alkene or alkyne gives rise to a single carboxylic acid product which could, how- 
ever, probably be more conveniently synthesised by other routes. Unsymmetri- 
cal non-terminal alkenes or alkynes are rarely used as substrates since a mixture 
of acidic products would be produced. The method has, however, found applica- 
tion using terminal alkynes since the terminal carbon is lost as carbon dioxide 
when, for example, the oxidation is carried out with potassium permanganate. 
In the illustrative example the acetylenic carbinol, l-ethynyl-3,3,5-trimethyl- 
cyclohexanol (Expt 5.41) gives a good yield of the corresponding hydroxy car- 
boxylic acid on oxidation in aqueous acetone (Expt 5.126). Oxidation of 
appropriate alkynes (and alkenes) to carboxylic acids can also be carried out 
efficiently using potassium permanganate under PTC conditions. ' 54

acetic acid passes over with about 200 ml of water. When all the trimethyl- 
acetic acid (the upper layer; 35-40 ml) has distilled, a liquid heavier than 
water (possibly brominated pinacolone) begins to pass over, Stop the distilla- 
tion at this point, separate the trimethylacetic acid from the aqueous layer,

lise from hot water (1 g of acid in 10 ml of water) (3), cool the solution in ice

(2) A continuous ether extractor (Fig. 2.92) gives more satisfactory results. 

(3) Do not boil the aqueous solution for a long time as the acid is markedly steam- 
volatile.

5.11.2 HYDROLYSIS OF ALKYL CYANIDES 

Since alkyl cyanides are readily available from the interaction of alkyl halides 
with sodium or potassium cyanide in aqueous alcoholic solution (Expts 5.157 
and 5.158), their hydrolysis to carboxylic acids is a valuable synthetic method. 
Aqueous alkaline or acidic conditions may be used. The reaction proceeds via 
the intermediate formation of an amide. Experimental conditions may be 
selected to interrupt the hydrolysis at the amide stage (Expt 6.167).

As well as the illustrative synthesis of a simple carboxylic acid (pentanoic 
acid, Expt 5.127), examples are given of the synthesis of some dicarboxylic acids,

(Expt 5.128). 

The nitrile group in the readily available a-hydroxynitriles (the cyano- 
hydrins) may also be similarly hydrolytically converted into a carboxyl group to 
afford a convenient synthesis of a-hydroxy acids (Expt 5.168).

flask, attach a double surface condenser and boil under reflux until the nitrile 
layer disappears (5-10 hours). Add through the condenser 100 ml of water, 
then slowly, and with external cooling, 125 ml of 50 per cent (by volume) sul- 
phuric acid. Separate the upper layer of valeric acid (it may be necessary to 
filter first from any solid present), and dry it with anhydrous calcium sul- 
phate. Distil and collect the valeric acid at 183-185 °C (mainly 184°C). The 
yield is 82 g (67%). A further 5g of acid may be obtained by extracting the 
strongly acidified aqueous layer with ether, combining the ethereal extracts 
with the low and high boiling point fractions of the previous distillation, 
removing the ether on a water bath and distilling the residue.

In a 2-litre round-bottomed flask, equipped with a double surface condenser,

sulphuric acid (by weight). Reflux the mixture for 10 hours and allow to cool. 
Saturate the solution with ammonium sulphate and extract with four 150 ml 
portions of ether; dry the ethereal extracts with anhydrous sodium sulphate. 
Distil off the ether on a water bath; the residual glutaric acid (69 g, 82%) crys- 
tallises on cooling and has m.p. 97-97.5 °C. Upon recrystallisation from 
chloroform, or benzene, the m.p. is 97.5-98 °C. 

Cognate preparations. Suberic acid (octanedioic acid). Heat a mixture of 
octanedinitrile (Expt 5.157) with 15 times its weight of 50 per cent sulphuric 
acid by weight under reflux for 10 hours. The acid crystallises out on cooling. 
Filter off the suberic acid upon a sintered glass funnel, and recrystallise it 
from acetone: m.p. 141-142 °C. The yield is 90 per cent of the theoretical. 

Pimelic acid (heptanedioic acid). Heat a mixture of 18 g (0.148 mol) of hep- 
tanedinitrile (Expt 5. 1 57) and 250 g of 50 per cent sulphuric acid by weight in 
a 750-ml round-bottomed flask under reflux for 9 hours. Most of the pimelic 
acid separates from the cold reaction mixture. Filter off the crystalline acid 
upon a sintered glass funnel. Saturate the filtrate with ammonium sulphate 
and extract it with three 50 ml portions of ether. Dissolve the residue on the 
filter (which is slightly discoloured, but is fairly pure pimelic acid) in the com- 
bined ethereal extracts, dry with anhydrous sodium sulphate and remove the 
ether by distillation. Recrystallise the residual solid acid from benzene con- 
taining 5 per cent of ether. The yield of pure pimelic acid, m.p. 105-106 °C, is 
22 g (93%). 

Phenylacetic acid. Into a 500-ml round-bottomed flask, provided with a 
reflux condenser, place 100 ml of water, 100 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid 
and 100 ml of glacial acetic acid: add 100 g (98 ml, 0.85 mol) of benzyl cyanide. 
Heat under reflux for 45-60 minutes; hydrolysis is then complete. Pour the 
mixture into 2-3 volumes of water with stirring. Filter the crude acid at the 
pump. Melt the crude material under water, and wash it two or three times 
with small volumes of hot water; the acid solidifies on cooling. Test a small 
portion for the presence of phenylacetamide (m.p. 155°C) by dissolving in 
sodium carbonate solution. If a clear solution results, phenylacetamide is 
absent; if the solution is not clear, shake the whole of the crude product with 
excess of sodium carbonate solution, filter and precipitate the phenylacetic 
acid from the clear filtrate by the addition of dilute sulphuric acid. Filter off 
the phenylacetic acid and recrystallise it from hot water or, better, light petro- 
leum (b.p. 40-60 °C). The yield of pure acid, 77 °C, is 50 g (43%). Small quan- 
tities of acid may be recovered from the mother-liquors by extraction with 
ether, but this is rarely worth while. Alternatively the acid may be purified by 
distillation under reduced pressure, b.p. 140-1 50 °C/20mmHg. The p.m.r. 
spectrum should be recorded and compared with that shown in Fig. 3.47. The 
1 3 C-n.m.r. spectrum is shown in Fig. 3.55.

adding 150 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid cautiously to 140 ml of water. 
Place 50g (0.31 mol) of p-nitrobenzyl cyanide (Expt 5.21) in a 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask, pour in about two-thirds of the sulphuric acid and shake well 
until all the solid is moistened with the acid. Wash down any nitrile adhering 
to the walls of the flask into the liquid with the remainder of the acid. Attach a 
reflux condenser to the flask and boil under reflux for 15 minutes. Dilute the 
rather dark reaction mixture with an equal volume of cold water and cool to 
°C. Filter with suction, and wash several times with ice-water. Dissolve the 
solid in 800 ml of boiling water (add decolourising carbon, if necessary) and 
filter rapidly through a hot-water funnel supporting a fluted filter paper. If 
any solid remains on the filter, dissolve it in the minimum volume of boiling 
water and filter into the main filtrate. Collect the pale yellow needles of 
p-nitrophenylacetic acid which separate on cooling, and dry at 100 °C. The 
yield of acid, m.p. 15 1-1 52 °C, is 53 g (95%). 

Vinylacetic acid (but-3-enoic acid). Place 1 34 g (161 ml, 2 mol) of allyl cyanide 
(Expt 5.157) and 200 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 1 -litre round- 
bottomed flask attached to a reflux condenser. Warm the mixture cautiously 
with a small flame and shake from time to time. After 7-10 minutes, a vigor- 
ous reaction sets in and the mixture refluxes; remove the flame and cool the 
flask, if necessary, in cold water. Ammonium chloride crystallises out. When 
the reaction subsides, reflux the mixture for 15 minutes. Then add 200 ml of 
water, cool and separate the upper layer of acid. Extract the aqueous layer 
with three 100 ml portions of ether. Combine the acid and the ether extracts, 
and remove the ether under atmospheric pressure in a 250-ml flask fitted with 
a Claisen still-head and a short fractionating column: continue the heating on 
a water bath until the temperature of the vapour reaches 70 °C. Allow the 
apparatus to cool and distil under diminished pressure; collect the fraction (a) 
distilling up to 71°C/14mmHg and (b) at 72-74 °C/14mmHg (chiefly at 
72.5°C/14mmHg). A dark residue (about 10 ml) and some white solid 
(?crotonic acid) remains in the flask. Fraction (b) weighs 100 g (58%) and is 
analytically pure vinylacetic acid. Fraction (a) weighs about 50 g and separ- 
ates into two layers: remove the water layer, dry the organic phase with 
anhydrous sodium sulphate and distil under reduced pressure; a further 1 5 g 
(8.7%) of reasonably pure acid, b.p. 69-70°C/12mmHg, is obtained. 

5.11.3 CARBOXYLATION OF GRIGNARD REAGENTS

XMg- / RO^C=0 &gt; R-CO-OMgX -^-&gt; R-C0 2 H 

The reaction is best carried out by pouring the ethereal solution of the Grignard 
reagent directly on to an excess of coarsely powdered solid carbon dioxide. The 
alternative procedure of passing dry carbon dioxide gas into the Grignard 
reagent solution may give rise to the formation of ketonic by-products by 
further reaction of the Grignard reagent with the carboxylate salt. (cf. Expt 
7.13).

Fit a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a mechanical stirrer, a double surface 
condenser and a separatory funnel and provide both the condenser and 
funnel with calcium chloride guard-tubes. Prepare an ethereal solution of 
but-2-ylmagnesium chloride from 12.5g (0.51 mol) of dry magnesium turn- 
ings, 46 g (52.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of dry 2-chlorobutane (1) and 400 ml of 
anhydrous ether by the procedure described in Expt 5.39, cognate prepara- 
tion. When the spontaneous reaction has subsided reflux the reaction mixture 
for a further 1 hour. Cool the flask in a mixture of ice and salt to — 12°C and 
add a further 100 ml of anhydrous ether. Weigh out (rough balance) 125g of 
Cardice (2) on a piece of stiff paper: wrap the Cardice in a stout cloth, and, by 
means of a pestle, break it into small lumps. Empty the Cardice into a dry 
1500-ml beaker and at once pour in the Grignard reagent in a slow steady 
stream; any unreacted magnesium will adhere to the sides of the flask. A 
vigorous reaction occurs. Stir the mass well, and allow it to stand untilall the 
Cardice has evaporated. Then add slowly a mixture of 300 g of crushed ice 
and 75 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Stir until the gelatinous com- 
pound is decomposed and there is a clean separation into two layers. Pour 
the mixture into a separatory funnel; rinse the beaker with 50 ml of ether and 
transfer this to the funnel. Separate the upper layer and extract the aqueous 
layer with three 40 ml portions of ether. Cool the combined ether extracts by 
the addition of ice, and add cautiously 100 ml of 25 per cent sodium hydrox- 
ide solution; run off and keep the aqueous layer and repeat the extraction 
with a further 50 ml of alkali solution of the same strength. The organic acid is 
thus converted into the sodium salt and passes into the aqueous layer; test the 
extracts with phenolphthalein to make certain that all the acid has been 
removed. Distil the alkaline extract until its volume is reduced by about 10 
per cent; this removes ether and other volatile impurities. Allow to cool, and 
cautiously acidify with concentrated hydrochloric acid; it is advisable to stir 
the mixture during the acidification process. Separate the upper layer of acid. 
Distil the water layer from a 1 -litre flask until no more oily drops pass over; 
saturate the distillate with salt, remove the acid layer and combine it with the 
main product. Dry the combined acid fractions with anhydrous calcium sul- 
phate, and distil. Collect the 2-methylbutanoic acid at 173-174 °C. The yield 
is 40 g (79%).

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.11 



Notes. (1) 2-Chlorobutane is employed in preference to the bromide because it is 
cheaper and the yield of acid is slightly higher. 

(2) Cardice should be handled with gloves or with a dry towel; if Cardice is held for a 
long time in the hand it may cause frost bite. The crushed Cardice should be used im- 
mediately otherwise it may absorb water which would react with some of the 
Grignard reagent. 

5.11.4 THE ARNDT EISTERT METHOD 

The Arndt-Eistert reaction is a comparatively simple method for converting an 
acid into its next higher homologue, or to a derivative of the homologous acid, 
such as an amide or an ester. The reaction is applicable to aliphatic, aromatic, 
alicyclic and heterocyclic acids, and the yield is generally good. 

The overall reaction is the insertion of a methylene group between the alkyl 
and carboxyl groups, and involves a rearrangement in the sequence of mechanis- 
tic steps. The reaction takes place in three stages: 

1. Formation of the carboxylic acid chloride, e.g. with thionyl chloride or with 
phosphorus .pentachloride. 

R P ^ R //° 
X OH N C1 

2. Formation of a diazoketone (4) by the gradual addition of the acid chloride to 
an excess of an ethereal solution of diazomethane. This reaction may be 
represented mechanistically as follows:

CH 2 -N=N - Me-N2 X CH-N=N 

g e 

(4) 




Cl e + Me-N 2 &gt; MeCl + N 2 1 

If the reaction is carried out with the acid chloride in excess, e.g. by adding the 
diazomethane solution slowly to the acid chloride, some halomethyl ketone is 
produced: 

R-CO-CH-N 2 + HC1 ► R-CO-CH 2 Cl + N 2 1 

3. Rearrangement of the diazoketone, with loss of nitrogen, in the presence of 
suitable reagents and a catalyst (colloidal silver-silver oxide, or silver nitrate 
in the presence of ammonia solution). An acid is formed in the presence of 
water, an amide results when ammonia or an amine is used, and an ester is 
produced in the presence of an alcohol.

a simple derivative thereof, is known as the Wolff rearrangement. Loss of nitro- 
gen from the diazoketone (4) is accompanied by a nucleophilic 1,2-shift of the 
alkyl group to yield a keten (5), which reacts with the solvent to give the car- 
boxylic acid or the appropriate derivative.

In order to prepare an acid, a dioxane solution of the diazoketone is added 
slowly to a suspension of silver oxide in a dilute solution of sodium thiosulphate. 
If the conversion to the acid yields unsatisfactory results, it is usually advisable 
to prepare the amide or ester, which are generally obtained in good yields; 
hydrolysis of the derivative gives the free acid. 

The conversion of a diazoketone to an acid amide may be accomplished by 
treating a warm solution in dioxane with 10-28 per cent aqueous ammonia solu- 
tion containing a small amount of silver nitrate solution, after which the mixture 
is heated to 60-70 °C for some time. Precautions should be taken (by use of a 
safety glass shield) when heating mixtures containing ammoniacal silver nitrate. 

Esters of the homologous acids are prepared by adding silver oxide in por- 
tions rather than in one lot to a hot solution or suspension of the diazoketone in 
an anhydrous alcohol (methanol, ethanol or propan-1-ol): methanol is generally 
used and the silver oxide is reduced to metallic silver, which usually deposits as a 
mirror on the sides of the flask. The production of the ester may frequently be 
carried out in a homogeneous medium by treating a solution of the diazoketone 
in the alcohol with a solution of silver benzoate in triethylamine. 

The reaction is illustrated here by the overall conversion of the dicarboxylic 
acid, sebacic acid, into dodecanedioic acid by a bis-homologation process (Expt 
5.130). 

A further illustrative use of a diazoketone, in this case as a source of a car- 
bene, is given in the preparation of azulene (Expt 6.16).

SebacoyI chloride. Convert 20 g (0. 1 mol) of sebacic acid (Expt 5. 1 3 1 ) into the 
corresponding acid chloride by heating it on a water bath in a flask fitted with 
a reflux condenser (protected with a calcium chloride tube) with 20 ml of 
thionyl chloride; the apparatus should be assembled in a fume cupboard. 
Purify the product by distillation under reduced pressure (use appropriate 
traps to protect the pump from the fumes of hydrogen chloride and sulphur 
dioxide). Collect the sebacoyl chloride as a fraction of b.p. 140-143 °C/ 
2mmHg; the yield is 18 g (77%).

tion containing about 6.8 g of diazomethane, i.e. two portions of the ethereal 
solution prepared as described in Section 4.2.25, p. 432, Method 3, 
CAUTION (1). Allow the mixture to stand overnight and remove any excess 
reagent together with some of the ether by distillation from a warm-water 
bath. To ensure that no undue hazard results from the possible presence ofun- 
decomposed excess diazomethane use a distillation assembly as described for the 
distillation of diazomethane-ethereal solutions {Section 4.2.25, p. 432, Method 
1). When the distillate is colourless, change the receivers, and complete the re- 
moval of solvent by distillation under reduced pressure (water pump). After 
recrystallisation from benzene the resulting 1,8-bis-diazoacetyloctane has 
m.p. 91 °C; the yield is 6.4 g (83%). 

Dodecanedioic acid. Add, with stirring, a solution of 5 g (0.02 mol) of the bis- 
diazoketone in 100 ml of warm dioxane to a suspension of 6.0 g of freshly pre- 
cipitated silver oxide (2) in 250 ml of water containing 8 g of sodium thio- 
sulphate maintained at 75 °C. A brisk evolution of nitrogen occurs; after 1.5 
hours at 75 °C, filter the liquid from the black silver residue. Acidify the 
almost colourless filtrate with nitric acid and extract the gelatinous precipitate 
with ether. Evaporate the dried ethereal extract: the residue of crude dodeca- 
nedioic acid weighs 3.3 g (72%), and has m.p. 116-1 17 °C. Recrystallisation 
from 20 per cent aqueous acetic acid raises the m.p. to 127-1 28 °C. 

Alternatively, treat 3.9 g (0.01 56 mol) of the bis-diazoketone in 50 ml of 
warm dioxane with 15 ml of 20 per cent aqueous ammonia and 3 ml of a 10 
per cent aqueous silver nitrate solution under reflux in a 250- or 500-ml flask 
on a water bath. Nitrogen is evolved for a few minutes, followed by a violent 
reaction and the production of a dark brown opaque mixture. Continue heat- 
ing for 30 minutes on the water bath and filter hot; the diamide of dodecane- 
dioic acid is deposited on cooling. Filter the product and air dry; the yield is 
3.1 g (87%), m.p. 182-1 84 °C, raised to 184-185 °C after recrystallisation from 
20 per cent aqueous acetic acid. Hydrolyse the diamide by refluxing for 2-5 
hours with a four molar excess of 3m potassium hydroxide solution. Acidify 
and recrystallise the precipitated acid from 20 per cent acetic acid. The yield 
of dodecanedioic acid, m.p. 127-128 °C, is almost quantitative. 

Notes. (1) Precautions in the use of diazomethane are fully described in Section 4.2.25, 

p. 430, and should be carefully noted; the operations should be carried out in a fume 

cupboard. 

(2) Prepare the silver oxide by adding dilute sodium hydroxide solution gradually to a 

stirred 10 per cent aqueous silver nitrate solution - until precipitation is just complete. 

Wash the product thoroughly with distilled water. 

5.11.5 ELECTROLYTIC (ANODIC) COUPLING 

The generation of radicals from carboxylate ions at the anode (Section 2.17.6, 
p. 1 1 5), and their coupling to form new carbon-carbon bonds is illustrated by 
the synthesis of hexacosane (Expt 5.1 1). The method has been usefully applied to 
the preparation of esters of long-chain carboxylic acids, from which of course 
the free acids may be prepared by hydrolysis. 

Simple anodic coupling by electrolysis in anhydrous methanolic solution 
(containing a little sodium methoxide) of methyl hydrogen adipate (Expt 5.147) 
gives dimethyl sebacate; methyl hydrogen sebacate (Expt 5.147) in turn yields 
dimethyl octadecanedioate (Expt 5.131, cognate preparations).

Electrolysis of a mixture of two carboxylic acids, R'-COjH and R 2 -C0 2 H, 
leads in addition to the products of normal coupling (R 1 — R 1 and R 2 — R 2 ) to 
the cross-coupled product (R 1 — R 2 ). Similarly if a mixture of a saturated car- 
boxylic acid and a half-ester of an a, co-dicarboxylic acid is electrolysed, there are 
three main products, viz. a hydrocarbon (6), a mono-ester (7) and a di-ester (8). 
Normally the three products are readily separable by distillation. Furthermore, 
by increasing the molar proportion of the monocarboxylic acid, the yield of (7) 
is improved at the expense of (8).

The unsaturated ester (9) is also often present in small quantity and arises from 
the loss of a proton from the intermediate carbocation (11), which is produced

200 ml of absolute methanol to which 0.13 g of sodium has been added. Elec- 
trolyse at 2.0 amps (Section 2.17.6), while maintaining the temperature 
between 30 and 40 °C, until the pH is about 8.0 (c. 6 hours). Neutralise the 
contents of the electrolysis cell with a little acetic acid and distil off the metha- 
nol on a water bath. Dissolve the residue in 200 ml of ether, wash with three 
50 ml portions of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, once with 
water, dry with magnesium sulphate, and distil through an efficient fraction- 
ating column (Sections 2.26 and 2.27). Collect the decane at 60°C/10mmHg 
(3.0 g), the methyl myristate at 158-160 °C/10mmHg (12.5 g, 52%) and 
dimethyl octadecanedioate at 215-230 °C/7mmHg (1.5 g). 

Reflux a mixture of 7.3 g of methyl myristate with a solution of 4.8 g of 
sodium hydroxide in 200 ml of 90 per cent methanol for 2 hours, distil off the 
methanol on a water bath, dissolve the residue in 400 ml of hot water, add 
15 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the solution at 50 °C in order to 
precipitate the organic acid, and cool. Collect the acid by suction filtration, 
wash it with a little water and dry in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of myris- 
tic acid (tetradecanoic acid), m.p. 57-58 °C, is 5.9 g (87%). 

Method B. Dissolve 55.2g (0.32 mol) of pure decanoic acid, m.p. 31-32 °C, 
and 25.6 g (0. 1 6 mol) of methyl hydrogen adipate in 200 ml of absolute metha- 
nol to which 0.25 g of sodium has been added. Electrolyse at 2.0 amps at 25- 
35 °C until the pH of the electrolyte is 8.2 (c. 9 hours). Neutralise the contents 
of the electrolytic cell with acetic acid, distil off the methanol on a water bath, 
dissolve the residue in about 200 ml of ether, wash with three 50 ml portions 
of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and remove the ether on a 
water bath. Treat the residue with a solution of 8.0 g of sodium hydroxide in 
200 ml of 80 per cent methanol, reflux for 2 hours and distil off the methanol 
on a water bath. Add about 600 ml of water to the residue to dissolve the mix- 
ture of sodium salts: extract the hydrocarbon with four 50 ml portions of 
ether, and dry the combined ethereal extracts with magnesium sulphate. After 
removal of the ether, 23.1 g of almost pure octadecane, m.p. 23-24 °C, 
remains. Acidify the aqueous solution with concentrated hydrochloric acid 
(c. 25 ml), cool to °C, filter off the mixture of acids, wash well with cold water 
and dry in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of the mixture of sebacic and myr- 
istic acids, m.p. 52-67 °C, is 26 g. Separate the mixture by extraction with six 
50 ml portions of almost boiling light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C. The residue 
(5.2 g), m.p. 132°C, is sebacic acid. Evaporation of the solvent gives 20 g 
(55%) of myristic acid, m.p. 52-53 °C; the m.p. is raised slightly upon recrys- 
tallisation from methanol. 

Cognate preparations. Sebacic acid (decanedioic acid). Dissolve 40 g 
(0.25 mol) of methyl hydrogen adipate in 100 ml of absolute methanol to 
which 0.1 g of sodium has been added. Pass a current of about 2.0 amps until 
the pH of the solution is about 8 (c. 5 hours); test with narrow-range indicator 
paper. Transfer the contents of the electrolysis cell to a 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask, render neutral with a little acetic acid and distil off the 
methanol on a water bath. Dissolve the residue in 150 ml of ether, wash with 
three 50 ml portions of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, then 
with water, dry over magnesium sulphate and distil under reduced pressure. 
Collect the dimethyl sebacate at 155°C/8mmHg; it melts at 26 °C and the 
yield is 14.6-16.0 g (51-56%).

5.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Reflux 14.6g (0.064 mol) of the ester with a solution of 10 g of sodium 
hydroxide in 125 ml of 80 per cent methanol for 2 hours on a water bath. Add 
200 ml of water to dissolve the solid which separates, extract with two 30 ml 
portions of ether and warm the aqueous solution on a water bath to remove 
dissolved ether. Acidify the ice-cold aqueous solution to litmus by the addi- 
tion of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Collect the precipitated acid by suc- 
tion filtration, wash it with a little cold water and dry at 100 °C. The yield of 
sebacic acid, m.p. 133 °C, is 11.5g (89%). 

Octadecanedioic acid. Dissolve 31.5 g (0.145 mol) of methyl hydrogen 
sebacate in 140 ml of absolute methanol to which 0.4 g of sodium has been 
added. Electrolyse at 2.0 amps until the pH of the electrolyte is 7.8-8.0 (3.5-4 
hours). Work up as described for sebacic acid. Upon distillation, an unsatur- 
ated ester passes over at lll-113°C/20mmHg (4.6 g), followed by dimethyl 
octadecanedioate at 212-219°C/4mmHg (mainly at 214-215 °C/4mmHg), 
m.p. 56°C(16.5g, 66%). 

Reflux 6.8 g of the dimethyl ester with a solution of 3.2 g of sodium hydrox- 
ide in 1 50 ml of 80 per cent methanol for 2 hours on a water bath. When cold, 
filter off the solid and wash it with a little cold methanol. Dissolve the solid in 
350 ml of warm water, add concentrated hydrochloric acid to the solution at 
60 °C until acidic to litmus, filter off the precipitated acid, wash with a little 
water and dry at 100 °C. The resulting octadecanedioic acid, m.p. 122 °C, 
weighs 5.3 g (84%). Recrystallisation from absolute methanol raises the m.p. 
to 124.5 °C. 

5.11.6 METHODS UTILISING DIETHYL MALONATE 

The retrosynthetic summary emphasises that diethyl malonate may be regarded 
as an acetic acid equivalent, and may be used when a disconnection gives rise to 
the synthons e CH 2 -C0 2 H or 2e CH-C0 2 H. The use of diethyl malonate in the 
preparation of carboxylic acids is illustrated in the sections below. 

HYDROLYSIS OF ALKYLMALONIC ESTERS 

When treated with one equivalent of sodium ethoxide, diethyl malonate is con- 
verted into the mono-sodio derivative, as a result of removal by base of one of 
the a-methylene protons to yield a mesomeric anion (12). This nucleophilic 
anion undergoes an Sjy2 reaction with an alkyl halide to give a C-substituted 
malonic ester. A second, different, alkyl group can be similarly introduced on to 
the a-carbon atom, or alternatively two identical alkyl groups may be intro- 
duced in a one-step operation by using appropriate proportions of reactants.

Alkaline hydrolysis of an alkylmalonic ester followed by careful acidification 
at 0°C gives the alkylmalonic acid (e.g. Expt 5.133). The alkylmalonic acids

undergo smooth decarboxylation on heating under acidic conditions, thus pro- 
viding a convenient synthesis of mono- or disubstituted acetic acids (Expt 
5.132).

THE USE OF MICHAEL ADDITIONS OF MALONATE IONS 

Typically the addition of the mesomeric anion (12) to the a, ^-unsaturated ester, 
diethyl fumarate, proceeds in a 1,4-manner (the Michael reaction or Michael 
addition).

The resulting tetraethyl ester on hydrolysis and decarboxylation yields propane- 
1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid. 155 In this example the malonate anion is generated by 
using one molar proportion of sodium ethoxide; this is Michael's original 
method. However, these conditions sometimes lead to competing side reactions 
and the formation of abnormal reaction products. Better yields of the required 
product are often obtained with small amounts of sodium ethoxide (the so- 
called catalytic method) or in the presence of a secondary amine (e.g. diethyl- 
amine, see below). 

Frequently the basic conditions used cause the initial Michael adduct to 
undergo intramolecular transformations, as for example in the synthesis of 
dimedone (Expt 7.11). This involves a Michael reaction between mesityl oxide 
and diethyl malonate followed by an internal Claisen ester condensation. 

The a, ^-unsaturated component for a Michael reaction may be formed in situ 
by an initial Knoevenagel reaction. An example is provided by the formation of 
tetraethyl pro pane- 1,1,3,3-tetracarboxylate (14) from formaldehyde and diethyl 
malonate in the presence of diethylamine. Diethyl methylenemalonate (13) is 
first formed by the simple Knoevenagel reaction and this is followed by the 
Michael addition process.

Acid hydrolysis of (14) is accompanied by decarboxylation to give glutaric acid

5.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The synthesis of 2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid (Expt 5.135) provides a further 
variant of the synthetic utility of the Knoevenagel-Michael reaction sequence. 
Ketones (e.g. acetone) do not readily undergo Knoevenagel reactions with 
malonic esters, but will condense readily in the presence of secondary amines 
with the more reactive ethyl cyanoacetate to give an a, ^-unsaturated cyanoester 
(e.g. 15). When treated with ethanolic potassium cyanide the cyanoester (15) 
undergoes addition of cyanide ion in the Michael manner to give a dicyanoester 
(16) which on hydrolysis and decarboxylation affords 2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid.

The synthesis of a-alkylglutaric acids (e.g. 2-propylglutaric acid, Expt 5.136), 
is conveniently achieved by allowing an alkylmalonic ester to react with the a, /?- 
unsaturated nitrile, acrylonitrile, in the Michael manner and then subjecting the 
product to vigorous acidic hydrolysis.

Diethyl butylmalonate. Prepare a solution of sodium ethoxide from 34.5 g 
(1.5 mol) of clean sodium and 1 litre of super-dry ethanol (Section 4.1.9, 
p. 401) (1) in a 2-litre three-necked flask following the experimental con- 
ditions given for ethyl propylacetoacetate (Expt 5.95). When the sodium eth- 
oxide solution, which is vigorously stirred, has cooled to about 50 °C, add 
247.5 g (234.5 ml, 1.55 mol) of redistilled diethyl malonate slowly through the 
separatory funnel; to the resulting clear solution introduce gradually (60-90 
minutes) 205.5 g (161.5 ml, 1.5 mol) of redistilled butyl bromide (Expt 5.54). 
Reaction occurs almost immediately and much heat is evolved; if the reaction 
becomes violent, cool the flask by directing a stream of cold water over it. 
Reflux the reaction mixture on a water bath until it is neutral to moist litmus 
(about 2 hours). Remove as much of the ethanol as possible by distillation 
under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) on a water bath. Cool the con- 
tents of the flask to about 20 °C, add 600 ml of water and shake well. Separate 
the upper layer of crude ester, dry it with anhydrous sodium sulphate and dis- 
til under reduced pressure. A low boiling point fraction passes over first, fol- 
lowed by diethyl butylmalonate at 130-135 °C/20mmHg. The yield is 285 g 
(88%). The distillation may also be conducted under normal pressure; the b.p. 
of the ester is 235-240 °C.

Hexanoic acid. Into a 2-litre three-necked flask, fitted with a separatory 
funnel, a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser, place a hot solution of 
200 g of potassium hydroxide in 200 ml of water. Stir the solution and add 
slowly 200 g (0.925 mol) of diethyl butylmalonate. A vigorous reaction occurs 
and the solution refluxes. When all the ester has been added, boil the solution 
gently for 2-3 hours, i.e. until hydrolysis is complete: a test portion should 
dissolve completely in water. Dilute with 200 ml of water and distil off 200 ml 
of liquid in order to ensure the complete removal of the alcohol formed in the 
hydrolysis (2). To the cold residue in the flask add a cold solution of 320 g 
(174 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in 450 ml of water: add the acid slowly 
with stirring in order to prevent excessive foaming. The solution becomes hot. 
Reflux the mixture for 3-4 hours and allow to cool. Separate the upper layer 
of the organic acid and extract the aqueous portion with four 1 50 ml portions 
of ether (3). Combine the acid layer with the ether extracts, wash it with 25 ml 
of water and dry with anhydrous sodium sulphate. Distil off the ether (rotary 
evaporator), transfer the residue to a flask fitted with a short fractionating 
column (the latter should be well lagged and, preferably, electrically heated) 
and distil the product from an air bath. Collect the hexanoic acid at 200- 
206 °C. The yield is 80 g (75%). Record the i.r. spectrum and compare it with 
that shown in Fig. 3.31. 

If desired, the distillation may be conducted under reduced pressure. The 
boiling points under various pressures are 99°C/10mmHg and 111°C/ 
20 mmHg; a 3 °C fraction should be collected. 

Notes. (1) With commercial absolute ethanol, the yield is reduced to about 225 g. 

(2) It is essential to remove the alcohol completely, otherwise some ethyl hexanoate, 
b.p. 168°C, is formed which will contaminate the final product. 

(3) Better results are obtained if a continuous extraction apparatus (e.g. Fig. 2.92) is 
employed. 

Cognate preparations. Diethyl propylmalonate. Use 34.5 g (1.5 mol) of 
sodium and 345 g (440 ml) of super-dry ethanol, 240 g (227.5 ml, 1.5 mol) of 
diethyl malonate and 185 g (136.5 ml, 1.5 mol) of propyl bromide (Expt 5.54). 
The yield of diethyl propylmalonate, b.p. 21 8-225 °C, mainly 219.5-221.5 °C, 
is 220g (72.5%). 

Pentanoic acid {valeric acid). Convert the diethyl propylmalonate into 
valeric acid, b.p. 183-185 °C, following the procedure described for hexanoic 
acid. The yield is 75 per cent of theory. 

3-Phenylpropanoic acid (hydrocinnamic acid). Use 1 1.5 g (0.5 mol) of sodium 
and 250 ml of dry ethanol, 80 g (75 ml, 0.49 mol) of diethyl malonate and 64 g 
(58 ml, 0.51 mol) of redistilled benzyl chloride (Expt 6.27). Follow the alkyla- 
tion procedure described above and isolate the crude diethyl benzylmalonate. 
Hydrolyse the latter with a solution of 75 g of potassium hydroxide in 75 ml 
of water and isolate the resulting crude 3-phenylpropanoic acid as described 
previously, using 1 80 ml of 5 m sulphuric acid in the acidification stage. Purify 
the product by distillation under reduced pressure, collecting the fraction of 
b.p. 164-172 °C/25 mmHg which solidifies at room temperature. Recrystallise 
from light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C (or from water containing a little hydro- 
chloric acid), to obtain 20 g (27%) of 3-phenylpropanoic acid of m.p. 47- 
48 °C.

5.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Nonanoic acid (pelargonic acid). Equip a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a 
reflux condenser, a sealed stirrer unit and a thermometer. Place 23 g (1 mol) 
of sodium, cut in small pieces, in the flask, and add 500 ml of anhydrous 
butan-1-ol (1) in two or three portions: follow the experimental details given 
in Expt 5.95 for the preparation of a solution of sodium ethoxide. When the 
sodium has reacted completely, allow the solution to cool to 70-80 °C and 
add 160 g (152 ml, 1 mol) of redistilled diethyl malonate rapidly and with stir- 
ring. Heat the solution to 80-90 °C, replace the thermometer with a dropping 
funnel and add 182.5 g (160ml, 1.02 mol) of 1-bromoheptane (Expt 5.55) 
slowly at first until precipitation of sodium bromide commences, and sub- 
sequently at such a rate that the butanol refluxes gently. Reflux the mixture 
until it is neutral to moist litmus (about 1 hour). 

Transfer the entire reaction mixture, including the precipitated sodium 
bromide and the small volume of water used to rinse the reaction flask, to a 3- 
litre flask. Add a solution of 140 g of potassium hydroxide in an equal quant- 
ity of water slowly and with shaking. Attach a reflux condenser to the flask, 
introduce a few fragments of porous porcelain and heat the mixture cau- 
tiously, with occasional shaking, until refluxing commences. Heat to gentle 
refluxing until hydrolysis is complete (about 5 hours, i.e. until a test portion is 
completely miscible with excess of water). Immediately equip the flask for 
steam distillation and steam distil the mixture until no more butanol passes 
over. Treat the residue cautiously with 270 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid while shaking gently, and reflux the mixture for 1 hour; if sodium chlor- 
ide separates as a solid cake, take care during the heating that the flask does 
not crack. When cold, transfer the mixture to a separatory funnel and remove 
the oil to a 750-ml round-bottomed flask. Heat it under an air-cooled reflux 
condenser in an oil bath at 180°C until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases 
(about 2 hours). Decant the oil into a Claisen flask with fractionating side- 
arm (the latter should be well lagged) and distil under reduced pressure. 
Collect the pelargonic acid at 1 40-1 42 °C/1 2 mmHg. The yield is 1 1 5 g (73%). 

Note. (1) This is conveniently prepared by drying commercial butan-1-ol with 
anhydrous potassium carbonate or anhydrous calcium sulphate, distilling through a 
column and collecting the fraction, b.p. 117-118 °C.

(Expt 5.132) slowly and with shaking. Attach a double surface reflux con- 
denser and reflux the mixture for 3 hours; hydrolysis is then complete, i.e. a 
test portion dissolves completely in excess of water. Distil off as much ethanol 
as possible on a water bath, and dissolve the residue in a comparatively small 
volume of water. Cool the solution in a large beaker surrounded by ice; add 
dilute sulphuric acid slowly from a suitably supported dropping funnel, whilst

on a water bath. Spread the syrupy residue in thin layers upon large clock 
glasses (1); after 2-3 days, filter off the crystals at the pump, using light petro- 
leum, b.p. 40-60 °C, to facilitate the transfer from the clock glasses to the sin- 
tered glass filter funnel. Spread the crystals on a porous tile to remove traces 
of oily impurities; the crude propylmalonic acid has m.p. 95-96 °C. Spread 
the filtrate and washings on large clock glasses as before and filter off the solid 
which crystallises after 1 day. Repeat the process until no further crystals are 
obtained. Recrystallise all the crystals from hot toluene. The yield of pure 
propylmalonic acid, m.p. 96 °C, is HOg (69%). 

Note. (1) An alternative procedure is to leave the syrupy residue in a vacuum desic- 
cator over anhydrous calcium chloride and silica gel, and to filter off the successive 
crops of crystals as they separate. These are washed with light petroleum, b.p. 40- 
60 °C, spread on a porous tile and recrystallised.

layer with anhydrous sodium sulphate and distil under reduced pressure. 
Collect the tetracarboxylate ester at 200-215 °C/20mmHg. The yield is 250 g

of ethyl cyanoacetate and 0.5 g of piperidine. Allow to stand for 60 hours and 
heat on a water bath for 2 hours. Treat the cold reaction mixture with 100 ml

water, saturate the solution with ammonium sulphate and extract with four 
75 ml portions of ether. Dry the combined ethereal extracts with anhydrous 
sodium sulphate, and distil off the ether. Recrystallise the residual acid from 
excess concentrated hydrochloric acid, and dry in the air. The yield of pure 
2,2-dimethylsuccinic acid, m.p. 141-142 °C, is 12 g (63%). The p.m.r. spectrum 
is recorded in trifluoracetic acid and reveals signals at 5 1.48 (s, 6H, Me 2 ) and 
2.92 (s, 2H, CH 2 ); the hydroxyl proton is not observed. 

Note. (1) Higher (including cycloaliphatic) ketones may be condensed with ethyl 
cyanoacetate under the following conditions. Mix 0.50 mol of ethyl cyanoacetate, 
0.55-0.70 mol of the ketone, 0.02 mol of piperidine and 50ml of dry benzene 
(CAUTION) and heat under reflux for 12-24 hours in an apparatus incorporating an 
automatic water separator (Fig. 2.31(a)). Piperidine may be replaced by a catalyst 
composed of 7.7 g (0.1 mol) of ammonium acetate and 24 g (0.4 mol) of glacial acetic 
acid. Wash the cold reaction mixture with three 25-ml portions of 10 per cent sodium 
chloride solution, and remove the benzene on a water bath under reduced pressure. 
Transfer the residue to a 1 -litre bottle containing a solution of 65 g of sodium metabi- 
sulphite in 250ml of water and shake mechanically for 2-6 hours. Dilute the turbid 
solution, which contains the sodium metabisulphite addition compound, with 400 ml 
of water, and extract the ethyl cyanoacetate with three 50 ml portions of benzene. Cool 
the bisulphite solution in ice, and add dropwise, with mechanical stirring, an ice-cold 
solution of 28 g of sodium hydroxide in 110 ml of water, Extract the regenerated 
unsaturated ester at once with four 25 ml portions of benzene, wash the extracts with 
50 ml of 1 per cent hydrochloric acid and dry with anhydrous sodium sulphate. Filter 
and distil through a fractionating column under reduced pressure; the benzene may be 
conveniently removed by distilling at atmospheric pressure until the temperature rises 
to 90°C. Diethyl ketone yields ethyl 2-cyano-3,3-diethylacrylate, b.p. 123-125 °C/ 
12mmHg or 96-97 °C/3 mmHg; dipropyl ketone gives ethyl 2-cyano-3,3-dipropyl- 
acrylate, b.p. 136-137 °C/11 mmHg or 1 16-1 17 °C/4 mmHg. The yield is 60-70 per 
cent.

and of 30 per cent methanolic potassium hydroxide (4.0 g) in t-butyl alcohol

for a further 3 hours. Neutralise the solution with 2 M-hydrochloric acid, 
dilute with water and extract with ether. Dry the ethereal extract with 
anhydrous sodium sulphate and distil off the ether: the residue [diethyl 
(2-cyanoethyl)-propylmalonate; 1 1 g] solidifies on cooling in ice, and melts at 
31-32 °C after recrystallisation from ice-cold ethanol. Boil the cyanoethyl 
ester (10 g) under reflux with 40 ml of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid solution 
for 8 hours, and evaporate the solution almost to dryness under reduced pres- 
sure. Add sufficient water to dissolve the ammonium bromide, extract several 
times with ether, dry the ethereal extract and distil off the solvent. The resid- 
ual oil (4.5 g, 66%) soon solidifies: upon recrystallisation from water, pure 
2-propylglutaric acid, m.p. 70 °C, is obtained. 



5.11.7 THE SYNTHESIS OF OPTICALLY ACTIVE CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 

Before 1967 the preparation of 2-alkyl-and 2,2-dialkyl-acetic acids was achieved 
by the classical and important malonic ester route (Section 5.11.6 above). An 

e 2e 

alternative reagent equivalent of the synthon R-CH-C0 2 H (or CH-C0 2 H) was 

proposed in the early 1970s. 156 Here a carboxylic acid in the form of a trialkyl 
orthoester, was first converted into a 2-alkyl-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline with 
2-amino-2,2-dimethylpropan-l-ol. Reaction of this oxazoline with butyllithium 
at —78 °C gave a lithio derivative which on treatment with an alkyl halide led, 
after hydrolysis, to a 2,2-dialkylacetic acid.

The most important development of this useful procedure has been the incorp- 
oration of an optically active amino alcohol, to provide a chiral adjuvant (or 
auxilliary), in the resulting oxazoline. The amino alcohol employed was (1S.2S)-

( + )-2-amino-l-phenylpropane-l,3-diol, a relatively inexpensive optically pure 
compound. 157 When reacted with a triethyl orthoalkanoate (or an iminoether 
hydrochloride of the corresponding carboxylic acid) an oxazoline was formed in 
good yield which was subsequently methylated to the 4-methoxymethyl com- 
pound.

In the subsequent reaction with lithium diisopropylamide the role of the meth- 
oxy group was seen to be crucial. Of the two lithio derivatives [(17) and (18)], 
which were probably in equilibrium with each other, the derivative (18) was con- 
sidered to be the more stable owing to the unfavourable cisoid interaction in 
(17). In the subsequent addition of the alkyl halide to the lithio derivatives, co- 
ordination of the non-bonded electrons of the halogen on to the lithium cation 
of (19) was seen as the next mechanistic step. Realignment of the alkyl group 
then facilitated an Sjy2 substitution reaction from the underside of the chelated 
complex (19). An upperside attack was considered to be unfavourable on steric 
and electronic grounds. Finally, hydrolysis gave rise to an optically active car- 
boxylic acid in high optical purity, it having been established that no racemisa- 
tion occurs during this hydrolytic step. In the example given in Expt 5.137, the 
orthoester used is triethyl orthopropanoate (R ' = Me) and the alkyl halide is 
butyl iodide (R 2 = Bu); the product is (S)-( + )-2-methylhexanoic acid.

160 g (0.91 mol) of triethyl orthopropanoate in 550 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane 
is heated under reflux for 7 hours. The solvent is removed leaving an oil 
(159g) which crystallises on standing. This is treated with 70 ml of ether and 
cooled in a dry-ipe-acetone bath and the partially purified product collected 
by filtration. The crystalline material is dissolved in ether (c. 600 ml), treated 
with charcoal, filtered, concentrated to about 300 ml and cooled to — 78 °C. 
The recrystallised material is filtered and washed with a small amount (15- 
20 ml) of precooled (-78 °C) ether. The yield of product is 106.9 g (69%), m.p. 
68-69°C, [a]ii 9 -135.1° (c 10.4 in CHC1 3 ).

dry benzene (CAUTION)] at a rate to maintain a mild evolution of hydro- 
gen. When addition is complete the mixture is heated at 50-60 °C for 1.5 
hours and cooled to ambient temperature; a solution of methyl iodide (16.2g, 
114 mmol, CAUTION) in tetrahydrofuran (10 ml) is added dropwise. The 
reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hours and slowly poured into 300 ml of ice- 
water, and then extracted with two 200-ml portions of ether. The combined 
ether extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated to 
give an oil which is distilled in vacuo to furnish the product in 87 per cent 
yield, b.p. 91-93 °C/0.25mmHg.

(15.4g, 70 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (160 ml) under nitrogen is cooled to 
— 78 °C in a dry-ice-acetone bath. To this is added a solution of 70 mmol of 
lithium diisopropylamide (from 9.8 ml of diisopropylamine and 33 ml of 2.2 m 
butyllithium in 75 ml of tetrahydrofuran) over a 20-minute period. The result- 
ing solution is stirred for 40 minutes at — 78 °C, and then the cooling bath is 
changed to methanol-liquid nitrogen and the reaction mixture allowed to 
cool to — 98 °C for 30 minutes (3). A solution of butyl iodide (14.7 g, 80 mmol) 
in tetrahydrofuran (20 ml) is added over 1 5-20 minutes at — 98 °C and the 
resulting almost colourless solution is stirred at this temperature for 2 hours, 
then slowly allowed to reach room temperature. The reaction mixture is 
poured into 300 ml of saturated brine and extracted with two 150 ml portions 
of ether, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated to give 17.7 g

(s,3H), 2.87-2.33 (m, 1H), and 2.00-0.67 (m, 12H). 

The crude oxazoline (17.2 g) is dissolved in 250 ml of 2 m sulphuric acid 
and heated to reflux for 3.5 hours, at which time the solution becomes homo- 
geneous. When the heating of the solution is initiated a crystalline solid 
appears which slowly dissolves as the reflux progresses. After the heating is 
discontinued, the solution is cooled to room temperature and extracted with 
two 75-ml portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 
three 100-ml portions of 5 per cent aqueous potassium carbonate solution 
and the aqueous extracts neutralised to pH 1 with 12 m hydrochloric acid. 
The resulting turbid mixture is extracted with three 75-ml portions of ether 
and the extract dried over magnesium sulphate. Concentration of the ether 
solution leaves an oil which is distilled (bulb to bulb) to give 5.80 g (66%) of

Notes. (1) This amino alcohol may be recrystallised by dissolving 1 part in 1 part of 
methanol and adding 2 parts of ethyl acetate and cooling. The pure material has m.p. 
112-1 13 °C, [a]ii 9 26.6° (c 10.0 in MeOH). 

(2) The apparatus set-up for this, and the following reaction, should take into account 
the moisture sensitivity of the reagents and the reaction intermediates. The reagents 
should be added by syringe through a rubber septum, the reaction media should be 
held under an atmosphere of nitrogen via a suitable nitrogen bubbler device, and the 
solutions should be stirred magnetically (cf. Section 2.17.8, p. 120). 

(3) Continued use of the cooling bath held at —78 °C leads to only a small diminution 
of optical purity in the final product.

5.11.8 SOME METHODS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE CARBOXYL GROUP 

The carboxyl group of aliphatic and alicyclic carboxylic acids may be protected 
by conversion into a variety of organic esters; silylation affords a valuable 
alternative. 

The wide range of standard procedures that are available for the formation of 
carboxylic esters of primary and secondary alcohols in the presence of suitable 
acid catalysts is discussed in detail in Section 5.12.3, p. 695. Also included is the 
mild method for methyl ester formation from the carboxylic acid and diazo- 
methane, and a method appropriate for sterically hindered esters involving the 
acid, a secondary or tertiary alkyl halide, and the non-nucleophilic base DBU 
(Expt 5.151). An example of the formation of a t-butyl ester is noted in Expt 
6.165. 

For some purposes protection of the carboxyl group by conversion into 
p-phenylphenacyl, p-bromophenacyl, and p-nitrobenzyl esters is useful. General 
procedures for their formation are described in Section 9.6.15, p. 1261. 

Methyl, ethyl (and to a lesser extent t-butyl) esters are perhaps the most com- 
monly used, and are stable to a wide range of oxidising conditions providing 
that a moderate pH environment is applicable. Careful selection of hydride 

690 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.12 



reducing agents is required to ensure chemoselectivity (see Section 4.2.49, p. 445) 
in the reduction of other functional groups (e.g. an aldehyde or ketone in the 
presence of a methyl or ethyl ester group). These esters react with lithium and 
magnesium organometallic reagents, but are stable to zinc and copper organo- 
metallics; this group is tolerant of Wittig-type reactants. 

Deprotection is effected in the case of methyl or ethyl esters by hydrolysis, 
usually under basic conditions (Section 9.6.17, p. 1266). t-Butyl esters are de- 
protected by mild acidic conditions, for example, formic acid at room temperat- 
ure, 159 toluene-p-sulphonic acid in benzene solution, or hydrogen bromide in 
acetic acid at 10 °C. 160 

The most appropriate silylating reagent for the formation of silyl esters is 
t-butyldimethylchlorosilane. A preparative example is given in Section 4.2.66, 
p. 461. Silyl esters are stable in non-aqueous media.

Formal replacement of the hydroxyl moiety of the carboxyl group with a 
halogen (X), an acyloxy group (R-COO — ), an alkoxy group (RO — ), or an 
amino group (NH 2 ) leads to: 

the acid (or acyl) halides [e.g. butanoyl chloride (1) CH 3 -CH 2 -CH 2 -COCl]; 
the acid anhydrides [e.g. acetic anhydride (2) (CH 3 -CO) 2 0]; 
the esters [e.g. ethyl 2-methylpropanoate (3) CH 3 -CH(CH 3 )-C0 2 Et];

A retrosynthetic analysis applied to each of these carboxylic acid derivatives 
suggests a fission of the carbon-heteroatom bond (C — O, C — X, C — N), i.e. dis- 
connection processes. Such logic can be useful in the recognition of the reagents 
that could be used in the synthesis of these functional types, when these are 
present in more complex molecules, as illustrated below.

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

All these derivatives show strong i.r. absorption arising from the stretching 
vibration of the carbonyl group. They may be distinguished from each other by 
inspection of the appropriate region for absorption arising from the carbon- 
bound halogen, acyloxy, alkyloxy, or amino (or imino) groups (p. 296). The 
p.m.r. spectrum as with the carboxylic acids (p. 666), allows an assessment of the 
skeletal structure of the alkyl groups to be made (p. 341). The interpretation of 
the m.s. of these derivatives is discussed on p. 380. Descriptive analyses of the 
spectra of specific compounds are given in the preparative sections below. 

5.12.1 ACYLHALIDES 

Acyl halides are invaluable acylating reagents and their preparation is therefore 
of great importance. The conversion of an aliphatic carboxylic acid into the cor- 
responding acyl chloride is usually achieved by heating the acid with thionyl 
chloride. 

O O 

R^OH + S ° C1 &gt; — * R A C1 + HC1 + S °&gt; 

This reagent is particularly convenient as the by-products of the reaction do not 
contaminate the product, and excess thionyl chloride is usually separable by 
fractional distillation. If the boiling point of the acyl chloride is too near to that 
of thionyl chloride the excess of the latter can be destroyed by the addition of 
pure formic acid. 

H-C0 2 H + SOCl 2 &gt; CO + S0 2 + 2HC1 

Phosphorus trichloride and phosphorus pentachloride are also suitable 
reagents for acid chloride formation, but their use is largely restricted to 
aromatic carboxylic acids. (Section 6.14.1, p. 1073).

Fit a 100-ml two-necked flask with a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser 
connected at the top to a gas absorption trap (Fig. 2.61). Place 36 g (21.5 ml, 
0.3 mol) of redistilled thionyl chloride in the flask and 22 g (23 ml, 0.25 mol) of 
butyric acid in the separatory funnel. Heat the flask gently on a water bath, 
and add the butyric acid during the course of 30-40 minutes (1). When all the 
acid has been introduced, heat on a water bath for 30 minutes. Rearrange the 
apparatus and distil: collect the crude acid chloride boiling between 70 and 
110°C. Finally, redistil from a flask provided with a short fractionating col- 
umn and collect the butyryl chloride at 100-101 °C. The yield is 23 g (86%). 

Note. (1) Wrap a piece of absorbent cotton wool around the stem of the reflux con- 
denser above the joint of the reaction flask to prevent condensed moisture seeping 
into the flask. 

Cognate preparations. Hexanoyl chloride. Place 58 g (62 ml, 0.5 mol) of hexa-

time to ensure mixing. Reflux for 30 minutes and isolate the hexanoyl chlor- 
ide by distillation, b.p. 150-155 °C. The yield is 56 g (83%). 

Valeryl chloride (pentanoyl chloride). Use 51 g (0.5 mol) of valeric acid and 
72 g (0.6 mol) of redistilled thionyl chloride. Proceed as for hexanoyl chloride; 
the yield of valeryl chloride is 42g (70%), b.p. 124-127 °C. 

Isobutyryl chloride (2-methylpropanoyl chloride). Use 140 g (1.6 mol) of iso- 
butyric acid and 236 g (2 mol) of redistilled thionyl chloride. Proceed as for 
hexanoyl chloride; the yield is 121 g (71%), b.p. 90-93 °C, after distillation 
through a Vigreux column (36 cm). 

Isovaleryl chloride (3-methylbutanoyl chloride). Use 34 g (0.4 mol) of iso- 
valeric acid and 47 g (0.5 mol) of thionyl chloride. Proceed as for hexanoyl 
chloride; the yield of isovaleryl chloride is 36 g (76%), b.p. 114-115°C, after 
distillation through a Vigreux column. 

Cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride. Use 91 g (0.7 mol) of cyclohexanecarboxylic 
acid and 166g (1.4 mol) of thionyl chloride. Proceed as for hexanoyl chloride 
but heat under reflux for 2 hours. The yield of cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride 
is 100 g (78%), b.p. 76-78°C/12mmHg, after distillation through a Vigreux 
column. 

5.12.2 ACID ANHYDRIDES 

Symmetrical (but not unsymmetrical) anhydrides are useful acylating reagents 
as milder alternatives to acyl halides. The most convenient procedure for their 
preparation involves the interaction in benzene solution of the acyl halide with 
the corresponding carboxylic acid in the presence of pyridine, which removes 
the hydrogen chloride liberated as the insoluble pyridinium chloride.

Without pyridine, anhydride formation would be incomplete, as a result of an

the temperature of the bath to 220 °C over a period of 1 hour and maintain it 
at this temperature for 3 hours from the time distillation commences: this 
time is necessary to ensure that the conversion of the mixed anhydride to hex- 
anoic anhydride and acetic acid is complete and that the acetic acid is com- 
pletely removed. Discontinue the distillation, allow to cool somewhat and 
distil the residue in the flask under reduced pressure (3-10 mmHg). Discard 
the small fraction (20 g) of low boiling point and collect the hexanoic 
anhydride at 118-121 °C/6mmHg(or 109-1 12 °C/3 mmHg). The yield is 90 g 
(84%). Record the i.r. spectrum and compare it with that of acetic anhydride 
(Fig. 3.34). 

Notes. (1) Excess of keten over the calculated quantity does not increase the yield; it 
leads to more acetic anhydride being collected in the low boiling point fraction. 
(2) The best results are obtained with a fractionating column surrounded by an elec- 
trically heated jacket but this is not essential for hexanoic anhydride. For the prepara- 
tion of propanoic or butanoic anhydride, a highly efficient fractionating column must 
be used in order to obtain satisfactory results.

In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask, provided with a reflux condenser pro- 
tected by a calcium chloride drying tube, place 59 g (0.5 mol) of succinic acid 
and 102 g (94.5 ml, 1 mol) of redistilled acetic anhydride. Reflux the mixture 
gently on a water bath with occasional shaking until a clear solution is 
obtained (c. 1 hour), and then for a further hour to ensure the completeness of 
the reaction. Remove the complete assembly from the water bath, allow it to 
cool (observe the formation of crystals) and finally cool in ice. Collect the 
succinic anhydride on a Buchner funnel or a sintered glass funnel, wash it

Equilibrium is only attained after refluxing for several days. If, however, about 3 
per cent (of the weight of the alcohol) of either concentrated sulphuric acid or of 
dry hydrogen chloride is added to the mixture, the same point of equilibrium can 

695 



5.12 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



be reached after a few hours. When equimolecular quantities of the acid and 
alcohol are employed, only about two-thirds of the theoretically possible yield of 
ester is obtained. According to the law of mass action, the equilibrium may be 
displaced in favour of the ester by the use of an excess of one of the components. 
It is frequently convenient to use an excess of the acid, but if the acid is expensive 
a large excess of the alcohol is generally employed. This method of esterification, 
in general, gives good yields with primary alcohols and fairly good yields with 
secondary alcohols. The method is unsatisfactory for use with tertiary alcohols 
owing to competing alkene formation from an acid catalysed dehydration. 

Esterification with alicyclic alcohols proceeds best when the alcohol is satur- 
ated with hydrogen chloride and treated with an excess of the carboxylic acid 
(the Fischer-Speier method); a very impure ester results if sulphuric acid is used 
as the catalyst. 

Examples of the use of these methods for the preparation of simple esters are 
collected in Expt 5.142. 

Esters of formic acid (Expt 5.143) are most simply prepared from the alcohol 
and an excess of formic acid, which, being a comparatively strong acid, does not 
require the use of added mineral acid to catalyse the esterification reaction. 
Sulphuric acid in any case should not be added since it causes the decomposition 
of formic acid to carbon monoxide. 

The acid-catalysed esterification reaction usually proceeds via an acyl- 
oxygen fission process. This involves the cleavage of the bond between the 
original carbonyl-carbon atom and an oxygen of an hydroxyl group in the inter- 
mediate (6) arising from nucleophilic attack by an alcohol molecule on the pro- 
tonated carboxylic acid group (5).

Several modifications of the simple direct esterification procedure described 
above have been developed. For example, it is sometimes convenient to prepare 
an ester by heating the organic acid, the alcohol and sulphuric acid in a solvent 
such as toluene. This method is illustrated by the preparation of diethyl adipate 
for which the procedure is particularly well suited (Expt 5.144). 

The process of acid-catalysed esterification in the presence of benzene, or, 
better, of toluene, is greatly facilitated if the water produced in the reaction is 
removed by distillation in a Dean and Stark water separation unit. This allows 
the separation and removal of water from the azeotrope, the organic phase being 
returned continuously to the reaction flask. Examples are provided in Expt 
5.145. These include examples of the synthesis of esters where either the alcohol 

696 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.12 



or the carboxylic acid component is 'acid-sensitive'. The mineral acid catalyst is 
replaced by a cation exchange resin (e.g. Zero lit 225/H®), enabling good yields 
of the required esters to be obtained. 

A recent procedure for the preparation of methyl esters involves refluxing the 
carboxylic acid with methanol and 2,2-dimethoxypropane in the presence of 
toluene-p-sulphonic acid as the catalyst (Expt 5.146). The water produced in the 
esterification process is effectively removed by acid-catalysed reaction with the 
ketal to give acetone and methanol.

PREPARATION OF ACID ESTERS OF DICARBOXYLIC ACIDS 

The acid-catalysed reaction of a dicarboxylic acid with an excess of alcohol 
yields the diester. However, the process may be adapted to prepare acid esters of 
dicarboxylic acids by using molar proportions of the diacid and alcohol (e.g. 
methyl hydrogen adipate, Expt 5.147). Alternatively the acid ester may be pre- 
pared by subjecting the diester to controlled partial hydrolysis with one molar 
proportion of potassium hydroxide.

The acid esters of 1,2-dicarboxylic acids are conveniently prepared by heating 
the corresponding cyclic anhydride with one molar proportion of the alcohol 
(see the preparation of alkyl hydrogen phthalates from phthalic anhydride and 
their use in the resolution of racemic alcohols, Section 5.19). 

Acid esters are useful synthetic intermediates. For example, their use in the 
synthesis of long-chain dicarboxylic esters by electrolytic (anodic) synthesis has 
already been noted (Expt 5.131). Furthermore the reaction of the acid ester with 
thionyl chloride in the usual way will convert the carboxylic acid grouping to an 
acyl chloride group thus yielding the synthetically useful ester-acyl chloride; the 
products are usually purified by distillation under reduced pressure.

One of the uses of these ester-acyl chlorides is for the synthesis of co-hydroxy 
esters which involves the selective reduction of the acyl chloride grouping with 
sodium borohydride 161 ; the alkoxycarbonyl group is unaffected by this metal 
hydride reducing agent (cf. Section 5.4. 1 , p. 519).

5.12 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



THE USE OF ACYL CHLORIDES AND ACID ANHYDRIDES 

Acyl chlorides react readily with primary and secondary alcohols to give esters 
in very good yields. With tertiary alcohols the presence of base (e.g. dimethyl- 
aniline) is essential to prevent acid-catalysed side reactions, such as dehydration 
or formation of the alkyl chloride.

Acylation may also be carried out with acid anhydrides in the presence of a suit-

a basic catalyst such as pyridine, may be used.

Examples of the use of these methods are given in Expts 5.148 and 5.149. The use 
of an acyl chloride or acid anhydride is the method of choice for the synthesis of 
phenyl esters (e.g. phenyl cinnamate; see also Section 9.6.6), which cannot be 
prepared by the direct esterification methods described above. 

The synthesis of ethyl 2-bromopropanoate (Expt 5.150) illustrates the pre- 
paration of an acyl chloride and its ready bromination in the a-position in the 
presence of red phosphorus. The resulting bromoacyl chloride is converted into 
the a-bromoester on reaction with an alcohol.

THE USE OF ALKYL HALIDES AND CARBOXYLIC ACIDS UNDER 
BASIC CONDITIONS 

The disconnection underlying this procedure is an alkyl-oxygen fission and not 
the acyl-oxygen fission as in the reactions discussed above. The non-nucleophilic 
base used in this reaction is l,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) which 
converts the carboxylic acid into its carboxylate ion but does not interact in a 
competing substitution reaction with the alkyl halide. The ester-forming reac- 
tion may therefore be regarded as an S^2 reaction between the carboxylate ion 
and the alkyl halide. 162

The reaction [illustrated by the formation of 1-methylheptyl acetate (Expt 
5.151)] proceeds in high yield and is particularly useful in those cases where a 
direct esterification of an acid with an alcohol is precluded on the grounds of 
undesirable side reactions (e.g. dehydration of the alcohol to an alkene).

THE ALCOHOL YSIS OF NITRILES 

An ester is formed when a nitrile is heated with an alcohol in the presence of con- 
centrated sulphuric acid, thus providing a two-step synthesis of an ester from an 
alkyl halide. Examples are to be found in Expt 5.152. The reaction proceeds by 
way of an intermediate imino-ester (7) which is not usually isolated, but may be 
if so required. 163

cautiously 1 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid (use a small measuring 
cylinder or a calibrated dropper pipette). Attach a reflux condenser and reflux 
the mixture for 3-6 hours (1). Pour the mixture into about 250 ml of water in 
a separatory funnel, remove the upper layer of crude ester and wash it again 
with about 100 ml of water, followed by about 25 ml of saturated sodium 
hydrogen carbonate solution and 50 ml of water. Dry the crude ester with 5- 
6g of anhydrous sodium sulphate. Filter through a small funnel containing a 
fluted filter paper and distil on a wire gauze or from an air bath. Collect the 
pure butyl acetate at 124-125 °C. The yield is 40 g (69%). The i.r. and mass 
spectra are shown in Figs. 3.33 and 3.85 respectively. The p.m.r spectrum 
(CC1 4 , TMS) show absorptions at S 0.93 (distorted t, 3H, Me-CH 2 ), 1.09-1.72 
(m, 4H, -CH 2 -CH 2 ), 1.95 (s, 3H, Me-CO) and 3.99 (t, 2H, CH 2 -0). 

Note. (1) A slightly better yield of ester can be obtained by increasing the quantity of 
acetic acid to 90-1 20 g and refluxing for 12-18 hours. 

Cognate preparations: sulphuric acid catalyst. Ethyl butanoate. Use a mixture 
of 88 g (92 ml, 1 mol) of butanoic acid, 23 g (29 ml, 0.5 mol) of ethanol and 9 g

water, wash several times with water, followed by saturated sodium hydrogen 
carbonate solution until all the acid is removed, and finally with water. Dry 
with anhydrous sodium sulphate, and distil. The ethyl butanoate passes over 
at 1 19.5-120.5 °C. Yield: 40g (69%). An improved yield can be obtained by 
distilling the reaction mixture through an efficient fractionating column until 
the temperature rises to 125 °C, and purifying the crude ester as detailed 
above under methyl acetate.

Diethyl sebacate. Reflux a mixture of 101 g (0.5 mol) of sebacic acid, 196 g 
(248 ml, 4.25 mol) of absolute ethanol and 20 ml of concentrated sulphuric 
acid for 12 hours. Distil off about half of the alcohol on a water bath, dilute 
the residue with 500-750 ml of water, remove the upper layer of crude ester 
and extract the aqueous layer with ether. Wash the combined ethereal extract 
and crude ester with water, then with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate 
solution until effervescence ceases, and finally with water. Dry with magne- 
sium sulphate or anhydrous sodium sulphate, remove the ether on a water 
bath and distil the residue under reduced pressure (b.p. 155-157 °C/6 mmHg). 
Yield: HOg (85%). 

Methyl crotonate. Use 43 g (0.5 mol) redistilled crotonic acid (b.p. 180— 
182°C, m.p. 72-73 °C), 75g (95ml, 2.33mol) of absolute methanol, 3ml of 
concentrated sulphuric acid and reflux for 12 hours. Isolate as for butyl 
acetate; the yield is 34 g (68%), b.p. 1 18-120 °C. Record the p.m.r. spectrum 
and by careful measurement of J values assign the absorptions. 

Benzyl acetate. Mix 31 g (29.5 ml, 0.287 mol) of benzyl alcohol (Expt 6.133) 
and 45 g (43 ml, 0.75 mol) of glacial acetic acid in a 500-ml round-bottomed 
flask; introduce 1 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and a few fragments of 
'porous pot'. Attach a reflux condenser to the flask and boil the mixture 
gently for 9 hours. Pour the reaction mixture into about 200 ml of water con- 
tained in a separatory funnel, add 10 ml of carbon tetrachloride (to eliminate 
emulsion formation owing to the slight difference in density of the ester and 
water, compare methyl benzoate, Expt 6.163) and shake. Separate the lower 
layer (solution of benzyl acetate in carbon tetrachloride) and discard the 
upper aqueous layer. Return the lower layer to the funnel, and wash it succes- 
sively with water, concentrated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (until 
effervescence ceases) and water. Dry over 5 g of magnesium sulphate, and dis- 
til from an air bath. Collect the benzyl acetate (a colourless liquid) at 213— 
215 °C. The yield is 16 g (37%). 

Cognate preparations: hydrochloric acid catalyst. Cyclohexyl acetate. Pass 
dry hydrogen chloride (Section 4.2.38, p. 438) into 75 g (0.75 mol) of pure 
cyclohexanol until 1.5 g are absorbed, mix with 135 g (2.25 mol) of glacial 
acetic acid in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask, attach a reflux condenser and 
reflux for 14 hours. Pour into excess of water, wash the upper layer success- 
ively with water, saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution until effer- 
vescence ceases, and water. Dry with anhydrous calcium chloride. Distil 
through a well-lagged fractionating column (e.g. an all-glass Dufton column). 
A small fraction of low boiling point (containing cyclohexene) passes over 
first, followed by cyclohexyl acetate (57 g, 54%) at 168-170 °C. Upon redistil- 
lation, the boiling point is 170-172 °C, mainly 171-172 °C. 

Cyclohexyl formate. Use 103 g (84.5 ml, 2.24 mol) of formic acid (98/100%) 
and 75 g (0.75 mol) of cyclohexanol in which 1.5 g of dry hydrogen chloride 
gas are dissolved. Reflux for 14 hours. Work up as above and distil through a 
well-lagged column; 5.5 g of cyclohexene and 57 g (59%) of cyclohexyl for- 
mate, b.p. 156-158.5 °C (mainly 157-158.5 °C), are obtained. On redistillation 
the sample boils at 158-160°C (mainly 159-160°C).

Ethyl p-anu'nobenzoate. Saturate 80 ml (63.2 g, 1.37 mol) of absolute ethanol 
with dry hydrogen chloride, add 12 g (0.088 mol) of p-aminobenzoic acid and 
heat the mixture under reflux for 2 hours. Upon cooling, the reaction mixture 
sets to a solid mass of the hydrochloride of ethyl p-aminobenzoate. It is 
better, however, to pour the hot solution into excess of water (no hydro- 
chloride separates) and add sodium carbonate to the clear solution until it is 
neutral to litmus. Filter off the precipitated ester at the pump and dry in the 
air. The yield of ethyl p-aminobenzoate, m.p. 91 °C, is 10 g (69%). Recrystalli- 
sation from rectified spirit does not affect the m.p.

ture using a magnetic stirrer/hotplate unit for 5 hours or until water no 
longer collects in appreciable amount in the water separator; run off the 
water from time to time. Filter off the resin at the pump and wash it with two 
25 ml portions of benzene. Shake the combined filtrate and washings with 
about 5 g of precipitated calcium carbonate, filter, and wash with a little

denser to the flask and stir the mixture magnetically for 4 hours in a water 
bath kept at 45 °C. Rearrange the condenser for distillation and distil off 
acetone (b.p. 56 °C) and methanol (b.p. 64 °C) on the water bath. Distil the 
residue under reduced pressure (water pump) and collect the dimethyl adi- 
pate, b.p. 130°C/25mmHg. The yield is 54.9 g (79%). 

Experiment 5.147 METHYL HYDROGEN ADIPATE 

H0 2 C-(CH 2 ) 4 -C0 2 H + MeOH -^ Me0 2 C-(CH 2 ) 4 -C0 2 H + H 2 

Place 175 g (1.2mol) of adipic acid, 50ml (1.25 mol) of absolute methanol, 
15 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and a few fragments of porous pot 
('boiling chips') in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask provided with a reflux con- 
denser (1). Heat cautiously at first until the mixture becomes homogeneous 
and then reflux for 8 hours. Transfer the mixture to a flask fitted with a frac- 
tionating column filled with glass helices and arrange to heat the column with 
a heating tape, the current to which is controlled by a Variac transformer. 
Careful fractionation under reduced pressure yields dimethyl adipate, b.p. 
113-1 14 °C/6 mmHg (21 g), and methyl hydrogen adipate, b.p. 154-156 °C/ 
6 mmHg (66 g, 34%). Unchanged adipic acid remains in the flask. 

Cognate preparation. Methyl hydrogen sebacate. Place 1 15 g (0.56 mol) of 
sebacic acid, 20ml -(0.5 mol) of absolute methanol, 6 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid and a few fragments of porous pot in a 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Warm the mixture on a water 
bath until it becomes homogeneous and then reflux gently for 8 hours. 
Transfer the mixture to a flask fitted with a fractionating column as for 
methyl hydrogen adipate and fractionate under reduced pressure; due pre- 
cautions must be taken so that the distillate does not solidify in the condenser 
or receiver. Collect the dimethyl sebacate at 153-1 54 °C/6 mmHg (20 g, m.p.

26 °C) and the methyl hydrogen sebacate at 185-186 °C/6mmHg (46 g, 43%, 
m.p. 37 °C). The residue in the flask consists of unchanged sebacic acid. 

Note. (1) The acid ester may also be prepared by either of two alternative procedures: 
(a) 1 mol of the diester is heated with 1 mol of the diacid for several hours; 164 (b) 1 mol 
of the diester is dissolved in 3 to 4 volumes of ethanol to which is added a solution of 
1 mol of potassium hydroxide dissolved in the minimum amount of ethanol, and the 
solution allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The ethanol is removed on 
a rotary evaporator, water is added to the residue and the solution extracted with 
ether to remove unreacted diester. The residual aqueous solution is then cautiously 
acidified at °C, the acid ester extracted with ether and the ether extract washed, dried 
and evaporated. The residue is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure.

Method A. Fit a 1-litre three-necked flask with a sealed stirrer, a reflux con- 
denser and a dropping funnel. Place 57 g (73.5 ml, 0.77 mol) of dry 2-methyl- 
propan-2-ol (t-butyl alcohol) (1), 101 g (106ml, 0.84mol) of pure 
dimethylaniline and 100 ml of anhydrous ether in the flask, set the stirrer in 
motion and heat the mixture to gentle refluxing on a water bath. Run in 62 g 
(56.5 ml, 0.79 mol) of redistilled acetyl chloride at such a rate that moderate 
refluxing continues after the source of heat is removed. When about two- 
thirds of the acetyl chloride has been introduced, the dimethylaniline hydro- 
chloride commences to crystallise and the mixture refluxes very vigorously. 
Cool immediately in an ice bath, and, after refluxing ceases, add the remain- 
der of the acetyl chloride; then heat the mixture on a water bath for 1 hour. 
Cool to room temperature, add about 100 ml of water and continue the stir- 
ring until all the precipitated solid has dissolved. Separate the ether layer and 
extract with 25-ml portions of cold 10 per cent sulphuric acid until the acid 
extract does not become cloudy when rendered alkaline with sodium hydrox- 
ide solution. Finally, wash with 15 ml of saturated sodium hydrogen carbon- 
ate solution and dry the ethereal solution with 5 g of anhydrous sodium 
sulphate overnight. Remove the ether by distillation through an efficient frac- 
tionating column and distil the residue through the same column. Collect the 
t-butyl acetate at 96-98 °C (mainly 97-98 °C). The yield is 55 g (62%). 

Note. (1) The t-butyl alcohol should be dried over calcium oxide or anhydrous cal- 
cium sulphate and distilled. 

Cognate Preparation. t-Butyl propanoate. Use 85.5 g (110.5 ml, 1.15 mol) of 
t-butyl alcohol, 151.5 g (159ml, 1.26 mol) of pure dimethylaniline and HOg 
(103 ml, 1.19 mol) of propanoyl chloride (compare Expt 5.138) and reflux for 
3 hours (b.p. 117.5-1 18.5 °C). Yield: 92 g (62%). 

Method B. Fit a 500-ml round-bottomed flask with a reflux condenser carry- 
ing a calcium chloride guard-tube. Place 100 ml (108 g, 1.06 mol) of redistilled 
acetic anhydride, 100 ml (1.07 mol) of dry t-butyl alcohol (see Note in Method 
A) and 0.3 g of anhydrous zinc chloride in the flask and shake. Heat the mix- 
ture gradually to the reflux temperature, maintain at gentle refluxing for 2 
hours and then cool. Replace the reflux condenser by an efficient fractionat- 
ing column and distil until the temperature reaches 1 10 °C. Wash the crude

distillate, weighing 100-125 g, with two 25 ml portions of water, then with 
25 ml portions of 10 per cent potassium carbonate solution until the ester 
layer is neutral to litmus, and finally dry with 10 g of anhydrous potassium 
carbonate. Filter off the desiccant, and distil through an efficient fractionating 
column (e.g. Widmer column) and collect the pure t-butyl acetate at 96-

Prepare vinylacetyl chloride from 50 g (31 ml, 0.42 mol) of thionyl chloride 
and 30 g (0.35 mol) of vinylacetic acid (Expt 5.128) following the procedure 
described for butyryl chloride (Expt 5.138); 27 g (0.26 mol) of the acid chlor- 
ide, b.p. 98-99 °C, are obtained. Place 12.6g (16.0ml, 0.27 mol) of absolute 
ethanol is a 250-ml two-necked flask provided with a reflux condenser and 
dropping funnel. Cool the flask in ice and introduce the vinylacetyl chloride 
into the dropping funnel; insert a calcium chloride guard-tube into the mouth 
of the funnel. Add the acid chloride dropwise (45 minutes) to the alcohol with 
frequent shaking. Remove the ice and allow to stand for 1 hour. Pour the 
reaction mixture into water, wash with a little sodium hydrogen carbonate 
solution, then with water, and dry with anhydrous calcium sulphate. Distil 
from a 50-ml flask through a short fractionating column, and collect the ethyl 
vinylacetate at 125-127 °C. The yield is 22 g (75%). 

Cognate preparation. Phenyl cinnamate. Place 72 g (0.48 mol) of cinnamic 
acid (Expt 6.138) and 60 g (37 mol, 0.5 mol) of thionyl chloride in a 250-ml 
flask, fitted with a reflux condenser which is connected to a gas absorption 
trap. Heat the mixture on a water bath, cautiously at first, until hydrogen 
chloride ceases to be evolved (about 1 hour), allow to cool and add 47 g 
(0.5 mol) of pure phenol. Heat the mixture on a water bath until no further 
evolution of hydrogen chloride is observed (about 1 hour). Then place the 
apparatus on a ceramic-centred wire gauze and heat the flask until the con- 
tents are brought just to the reflux temperature in order to complete the reac- 
tion: do not heat unduly long as prolonged heating leads to loss of product 
due to decomposition and polymerisation. Allow the reaction mixture to cool 
and distil under diminished pressure; collect the fraction of b.p. 190-210 °C/ 
15 mmHg. This solidifies to a pale yellow solid, m.p. 66-69 °C, weighing 98 g. 
Grind it to a powder in a glass mortar and wash the powder with 250 ml of 
cold 2 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. Recrystallise from recti- 
fied spirit (150 ml); 81 g (72%) of pure phenyl cinnamate (white crystals) of 
m.p. 75-76 °C are obtained.

of concentrated sulphuric acid in a round-bottomed flask, fitted with an effi- 
cient reflux condenser. Reflux the mixture, which soon separates into two 
layers, gently for 8 hours, cool and pour into 350 ml of water. Separate the 
upper layer. Dissolve it in about 75 ml of ether (1) in order to facilitate the 
separation of the layers in the subsequent washing process. Wash the ethereal 
solution carefully with concentrated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution 
until effervescence ceases and then with water. Dry over 10 g of anhydrous 
calcium sulphate for at least 30 minutes. Remove the solvent by flash distilla- 
tion and distil the residue from an air bath. The ethyl phenylacetate passes 
over at 225-229 °C (mainly 228 °C) as a colourless liquid; the yield is 90 g 
(86%). Alternatively, the residue after removal of ether may be distilled under 
diminished pressure; collect the ester at 116-118°C/20mmHg. 

Note. (1) Alternatively use 20 ml of carbon tetrachloride. The carbon tetrachloride 
solution then forms the lower layer in all washing operations. 

Experiment 5.153 TRIETHYL ORTHOFORMATE (Triethoxymethane) 
CHC1 3 + 3EtONa &gt; CH(OEt) 3 + 3NaCl 

CAUTION: This experiment should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 

Fit a 1500-ml round-bottomed flask with a large double surface reflux 
condenser. Make sure that the apparatus is thoroughly dry. Place 750 ml of 
super-dry ethanol (Section 4.1.9, p. 401) and 123 g (82 ml, 1.03 mol) of dry 
chloroform (CAUTION) in the flask. Add 52 g (2.25 mol) of clean sodium, 
cut into small pieces, through the condenser in the course of 30 minutes; when 
the reaction becomes vigorous, cool the outside of the flask by running water 
from the condenser outlet. When all the sodium has reacted and the mixture 
has attained room temperature, filter off the sodium chloride through a 
sintered glass funnel. The filtration apparatus must be thoroughly dry, and a 
drying tube, filled with granular calcium chloride, should be placed between 
the filter flask and the pump. Wash the solid on the filter with 50 ml of abso- 
lute ethanol and allow the washings to run into the main filtrate. Distil the 
solution from a water bath through an efficient fractionating column in order 
to recover the excess of chloroform and most of the alcohol; collect the distil- 
late (about 500 g) (A) in a filter flask protected by a drying tube. Decant the 
liquid remaining in the flask from a little salt which has separated, and distil it 
through an all-glass Dufton (or Widmer) column. A fraction (B) of low boil- 
ing point passes over first, followed by the triethyl orthoformate at 144- 
146 °C. The yield is 35 g (23%) but depends somewhat upon the efficiency of 
the fractionation. 

Carry out a second run with the recovered chloroform-alcohol mixture 
(A): add 100 g of dry chloroform and sufficient super-dry ethanol (200- 
250 ml) to give a total volume of 750 ml. Add 52 g of sodium as before. 
Remove the excess of chloroform and alcohol as before on a water bath 
through a fractionating column, add the intermediate fraction (B) from the 
first run, and fractionate again. The yield of product, b.p. 144-146 °C is 45 g

5.12 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



5.12.4 ACID AMIDES 

Primary aliphatic amides are formed on heating the ammonium salts of the 
corresponding carboxylic acids, or by heating an acid or its ammonium salt with 
urea. 

R-C0 2 NH 4 &gt; R-CONH 2 + H 2 

R-C0 2 H + NH 2 -CONH 2 &gt; R-CONH 2 + C0 2 + NH 3 

The preferred preparative routes to amides however start from the following 
carboxylic acid derivatives. 

FROM ACYL HALIDES 

The reaction of an acyl chloride with an excess of ammonia represents one of the 
best procedures for the preparation of primary amides (Expt 5.154). 

O O 

JL + 2NH, &gt; JL + NH 4 C1 

The acyl chloride (the crude material prepared by the thionyl chloride method is 
quite satisfactory) is added dropwise to well-stirred concentrated aqueous 
ammonia cooled in a freezing mixture. The amides of the higher carboxylic acids 
crystallise out on standing and need only to be filtered and recrystallised. Water- 
soluble amides are isolated by extraction with hot ethyl acetate following re- 
moval of water on a rotary evaporator. 

A milder procedure 165 involves stirring a solution of the acyl chloride in 
acetone at room temperature with ammonium acetate. The filtered solution is 
evaporated to recover the required amide. 

The use of primary or secondary amines in place of ammonia yields the cor- 
responding secondary or tertiary amides in reaction with an acyl chloride. These 
compounds often serve as crystalline derivatives suitable for the characterisation 
of either the acyl chloride (and hence of the carboxylic acid itself) or the amine 
(Sections 9.6.16, p. 1265 and 9.6.21, p. 1273). 

FROM ESTERS 

Amides are very easily prepared by the interaction of carboxylic esters with con- 
centrated aqueous ammonia (ammonolysis). 

R'-C0 2 R 2 + NH 3 &gt; R'-CONH 2 + R 2 OH 

The reaction usually proceeds readily in the cold, particularly when the methyl 
esters of the lower molecular weight carboxylic acids are involved. Sparingly 
soluble amides crystallise out from the reaction mixture upon standing, as in the 
case of succinamide (Expt 5.155). 

FROM NITRILES 

The interruption of the hydrolysis of a nitrile at the amide stage can often be 
achieved in a preparative manner, as for example in the preparation of phenyl- 
acetamide (Expt 5.156), where the nitrile is dissolved in concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid at 40 °C and subsequently poured into water. The use of hot 
polyphosphoric acid has also been recommended. 166 

708 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.12 



RCN + H 2 -^— »■ R-CO-NH 2 

Reaction conditions which are particularly applicable to aromatic nitriles in- 
volve the use of an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide containing hydrogen 
peroxide, but alkyl cyanides do not always give good results; the method is illus- 
trated by the preparation of toluamide (Expt 6.167). 

Experiment 5.154 HEXANAMIDE 

Me-(CH 2 ) 4 -COCl + 2NH 3 &gt; Me-(CH 2 ) 4 -CONH 2 + NH 4 C1 

Place 125 ml of concentrated ammonia solution (dO.88) in a 600-ml beaker 
and surround the latter with crushed ice. Stir the ammonia solution mechan- 
ically, and introduce 56 g (0.42 mol) of hexanoyl chloride (Expt 5.138) slowly 
by means of a suitably supported separatory funnel. The rate of addition 
must be adjusted so that no white fumes are lost. The amide separates im- 
mediately. Allow to stand in the ice-water for 15 minutes after all the acid 
chloride has been introduced. Filter off the amide at the pump; use the filtrate 
to assist the transfer of any amide remaining in the beaker to the filter (1). 
Spread the amide on sheets of filter or drying paper to dry in the air. The 
crude hexanamide (30 g, 63%) has m.p. 98-99 °C and is sufficiently pure for 
conversion into the nitrile (Expt 5.160) (2). Recrystallise a small quantity of 
the amide by dissolving it in the minimum volume of hot water and allowing 
the solution to cool; dry on filter paper in the air. Pure hexanamide has m.p. 
100 °C. 

Notes. (1) The nitrate will deposit small amounts of hexanamide upon concentration 

to half its original volume. 

(2) The process is of general application for higher (i.e. &gt; C 5 ) fatty acids. 

Cognate preparation. Isobutyramide (2-methylpropanamide). Add 106 g 
(1 mol) of isobutyryl chloride (Expt 5.138) to 400 ml of concentrated ammo- 
nia solution (dO.88) contained in a 2-litre two-necked flask fitted with a 
stirrer and dropping funnel, at such a rate that the temperature does not rise 
above 15 °C. Stir for 1 hour after the addition is complete and attach the flask 
to a rotary evaporator, connect to a water-jet pump and heat the flask on a 
boiling water bath until the crystalline deposit is quite dry. Boil the residue 
with 1200 ml of ethyl acetate, filter the hot solution and extract the residue 
with further quantities of hot ethyl acetate (2 x 750 ml). Combine the 
extracts, cool to 0°C and collect the crystals of isobutyramide of m.p. 128— 
1 29 °C. The yield after recovery of further crops of crystalline material from 
the concentrated mother-liquors is 58 g (66%).

Add 5g (4.8 ml, 0.034 mol) of dimethyl succinate to 25 ml of concentrated

shake the contents for a few minutes: allow to stand for 24 hours with occa- 
sional shaking. Filter off the crystals of succinamide, and wash with a little 
cold water. Recrystallise from a little hot water and dry in an oven. The yield 
is 3.5 g (88%). Pure succinamide melts at 254 °C with decomposition. 

Experiment 5.156 PHENYLACETAMIDE 

H 2 0. HC1 

Ph-CH 2 -CN w , c &gt; Ph-CH 2 -CO-NH 2 

In a 2-litre three-necked flask, provided with a thermometer, reflux condenser 
and efficient mechanical stirrer, place 100 g (98 ml, 0.85 mol) of benzyl cyanide 
(Expt 5.157) and 400 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Immerse the flask 
in a water bath at 40 °C and stir the mixture vigorously: the benzyl cyanide 
passes into solution within 20-40 minutes and the temperature of the reaction 
mixture rises to about 50 °C. Continue the stirring for an additional 20-30 
minutes after the mixture is homogeneous. Replace the warm water in the 
bath by tap water at 15°C, replace the thermometer by a dropping funnel 
charged with 400 ml of cold distilled water and add the latter with stirring: 
crystals commence to separate after about 50-75 ml have been introduced. 
When all the water has been run in, cool the mixture externally with ice-water 
for 30 minutes (1), and collect the crude phenylacetamide by filtration at the 
pump. Remove traces of phenylacetic acid by stirring the wet solid for about 
30 minutes with two 50 ml portions of cold water; dry the crystals at 50-80 °C. 
The yield of phenylacetamide, m.p. 154-155 °C, is 95 g (82%). Recrystallisa- 
tion from rectified spirit raises the m.p. to 156 °C. 

Note. (1) The suspension of phenylacetamide may be further hydrolysed to phenyl- 
acetic acid by refluxing with stirring until the solid dissolves. The mixture becomes 
turbid after 30 minutes and the product begins to separate as an oil: refluxing is con- 
tinued for 6 hours, the mixture is cooled first with tap water and then by an ice-water 
bath for about 4 hours. The crude phenylacetic acid is filtered at the pump, washed 
with two 50 ml portions of cold water and dried in a desiccator. The resulting crude 
acid melts at 69-70 °C; it may be purified by recrystallisation from light petroleum 
(b.p. 40-60 °C) or, better, by vacuum distillation.

cedures.

2. Displacement with cyanide ion on an arylsulphonylhydrazone (Expt 5.159). 

3. The dehydration of amides (Expt 5.160), and aldoximes (see Section 6.15.3,

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The sharp and intense characteristic i.r . absorption arising from the stretching of 
the carbon-nitrogen triple bond in the region of 2260 cm ~ ' , is easily recognised 
and distinguished from the weaker absorption of the carbon-carbon triple 
bond, which also occurs in this region. The a-protons of alkyl cyanides are relat- 
ively more shielded due to magnetic anisotropic effects (cf. alkynes, p. 325), and 
therefore resonate in the p.m.r. spectra at higher field than might have been ex- 
pected from the purely electron-withdrawing nature of the cyano group (cf. the 
alkyl halides, p. 324). The main features of the m.s. of alkyl cyanides have been 
outlined on p. 382. Examples of the interpretation of these spectral features are 
included in some of the preparations below. 

5.13.1 DISPLACEMENT WITH CYANIDE ION ON AN ALKYL HALIDE 

The classical procedure for the reaction involves heating the alkyl halide 
(usually the chloride or bromide) with sodium or potassium cyanide in metha- 
nolic or ethanolic solution. The method is clearly of value for the extension of 
the carbon chain by one carbon atom, since the cyano group may be converted 
into a carboxyl group by hydrolysis (Section 5.1 1.2, p. 671) or into an amino- 
methyl group ( — CH 2 -NH 2 ) by reduction (Section 5.16.1, p. 771), or into a 
formyl group by controlled reduction to the imine followed by hydrolysis 
(Section 5.7.4, p. 594). ' 

Br-!-R K CN &gt; RCN + Br 

This method has been widely used for primary and secondary halides; tertiary 
halides undergo ready elimination under these conditions to yield the alkene 
and give little or no nitrile. Traces of the corresponding isonitriles (R-NC) may 
be formed during these displacement reactions but may be removed by virtue of 

711 



5.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



their ready hydrolysis with aqueous mineral acid. In the case of the conversion 
of allyl bromide into allyl cyanide, copper(i) cyanide is used in place of an alkali 
metal cyanide. The procedures are illustrated with reference to the preparation 
of a range of mono- and dinitriles, the latter from the corresponding oe,co-di- 
bromo compounds (Expt 5.157). 

Aprotic solvents such as dimethyl sulphoxide or dimethyl formamide signific- 
antly improve the procedure in that the less reactive alkyl chlorides are more 
rapidly converted into the nitriles in good yield by sodium cyanide (Expt 5.158). 

Three PTC methods are worthy of note. In the first the alkyl halide is treated 
with sodium cyanide in decane solution in the presence of catalytic amounts of 
hexadecyltributylphosphonium bromide. 167 " In the second tetraethylammo- 
nium cyanide in molar quantities is used in dichloromethane solution with the 
alkyl halide. 167b In the third method, which is reported to be most satisfactory in 
the case of allylic and benzylic halides, a solid/liquid system of potassium 
cyanide and 18-crown-6 ether is employed. 168 

5.13.2 DISPLACEMENT WITH CYANIDE ION ON AN ARYLSULPHONYLHYDRAZONE 

Reaction of cyanide ion with an alkyl halide is often the most convenient route 
to a nitrile, but in those cases where the corresponding aldehyde or ketone is 
more readily available than the alkyl halide, the following procedure is very con- 
venient. The carbonyl compound is first converted into its 2,4,6-triisopropyl- 
benzenesulphonyl hydrazone (1) (Expt 6.42 gives the method for the 
preparation of the reagent, TBSH), which without isolation is then reacted with 
potassium cyanide under gentle reflux. 169

The method is applicable to a wide range of aliphatic and alicyclic (but not aro-

CAUTION: Sodium and potassium cyanide are very poisonous and should be 
handled with great care; disposable plastic gloves should be worn. Alkyl 
cyanides are likewise very poisonous and all operations should be conducted in 
an efficient fume cupboard. 

Fit a 2-litre two-necked flask with a separatory funnel and a reflux con- 
denser. Place 147 g (3 mol) of finely powdered sodium cyanide (1) and 150 ml 
of water in the flask and heat on a water bath until most of the solid passes 
into solution. Add a solution of 250 g (126 ml, 1.25 mol) 1,3-dibromopropane 
(Expt 5.54) in 500 ml of rectified spirit through the separatory funnel over a 
period of 30 minutes. Reflux the mixture on a water bath for 35 hours; then

remove the solvent (rotary evaporator) using a boiling-water bath. The resi- 
due in the flask consists of sodium bromide, unreacted sodium cyanide and 
the dinitrile: the last-named alone is soluble in ethyl acetate. Extract the resi- 
due with 200 ml of ethyl acetate. Filter the solution through a sintered glass 
funnel and wash the solid with about 50 ml of ethyl acetate. Dry the filtrate, 
after removing the aqueous layer, with anhydrous calcium sulphate, distil off 
the ethyl acetate at atmospheric pressure (about 245 ml are recovered), allow 
to cool somewhat and distil the liquid under reduced pressure. Collect the 
pentanedinitrile at 1 39-140 °C/8mmHg. The yield is 95 g (82%); l3 C-n.m.r.

Note. (1) Dry the powdered commercial material (c. 98% pure) in a vacuum desic- 
cator over potassium hydroxide pellets. Sodium cyanide is very poisonous and must be 
handled with great care. Residual solutions containing alkali cyanides should be 
rendered innocuous by the addition of an excess of sodium hypochlorite before being 
washed down the main drain of the laboratory with a liberal supply of water; they 
should never be treated with acid. 

Cognate preparations. Heptanenitrile. Use 30 g (0.61 mol) of sodium cyanide 
dissolved in 40ml of water; 82g (70ml, 0.5 mol) of 1-bromohexane (Expt 
5.55) in 150 ml of methanol. Remove the methanol through an efficient frac- 
tionating column, add 500 ml of water and separate the upper layer of crude 
nitrile. Purify the crude nitrile by shaking it twice with about half its volume 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then successively with water, satur- 
ated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and water. Dry with anhydrous 
calcium chloride and distil. Collect the heptanenitrile at b.p. 182-1 84 °C. The 
yield is 40 g (73%). 

Heptanedinitrile. Use 29 g (0.446 mol) of potassium cyanide, 30 ml of water 
and 45 g (0.195 mol) of 1,5-dibromopentane (Expt 5.54) in 75 ml of rectified 
spirit. Reflux for 8 hours and work-up as for pentanedinitrile but using ether 
as the extracting solvent. Distil the crude heptanedinitrile under diminished 
pressure and collect the main fraction at b.p. 168-170 °C/1 5 mmHg. The yield 
is 18 g (75%). 

Octanedinitrile. 1,6-Dibromohexane (Expt 5.55) may be converted into 
octanedinitrile, b.p. 178-180°C/15mmHg, as in the foregoing experiment. 

Benzyl cyanide. Place 1 00 g (2 mol) of powdered sodium cyanide and 90 ml of 
water in a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask provided with a reflux condenser. 
Warm on a water bath until the sodium cyanide dissolves. Add down the con- 
denser a solution of 200 g (181.5 ml, 1.58 mol) of benzyl chloride (Expt 5.27) in 
200 g of rectified spirit during 30-45 minutes. Heat the mixture in a water 
bath for 4 hours, cool and filter off the precipitated sodium chloride with suc- 
tion; wash with a little alcohol. Distil off as much as possible of the alcohol 
using a rotary evaporator. Cool the residual liquid, filter if necessary and 
separate the layer of crude benzyl cyanide. (Sometimes it is advantageous to 
extract the nitrile with ether.) Dry over a little magnesium sulphate, and distil 
under diminished pressure. Collect the benzyl cyanide at 102-103 °C/ 
10 mmHg. The yield is 160 g (86%). 

This product is sufficiently pure for most purposes but it contains some 
benzyl isocyanide and usually develops an appreciable colour on standing. 

713 



5.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The following procedure removes the isocyanide and gives a stable water- 
white compound. Shake the once-distilled benzyl cyanide vigorously for 5 
minutes with an equal volume of warm (60 °C) 50 per cent sulphuric acid 
(prepared by adding 55 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid to 100 ml of water). 
Separate the benzyl cyanide, wash it with an equal volume of saturated 
sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and then with an equal volume of half- 
saturated sodium chloride solution. Dry with magnesium sulphate and distil 
under reduced pressure. 

1-Naphthylacetonhrile. Place a mixture of 56 g (0.32 mol) of l-(chloro- 
methyl)naphthalene, 29 g (0.45 mol) of potassium cyanide, 125 ml of ethanol 
and 50 ml of water in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a double sur- 
face reflux condenser, and reflux for 1 hour. Distil off the alcohol, transfer the 
residue to a separatory funnel, wash it with water, filter from a small amount 
of solid, transfer to a dish and dry under reduced pressure (vacuum desiccator 
charged with anhydrous calcium chloride). Distil under diminished pressure 
and collect the 1-naphthylacetonitrile at 155-1 60 °C/9mmHg (1); the yield is 
38g(72%). 

Note. (1) A little naphthalene may pass over first owing to impurities in the original 
chloromethylnaphthalene. 

Allyl cyanide. Into a 2-litre three-necked flask, provided with a sealed stirrer 
and two long double surface condensers, place 293 g (210 ml, 2.42 mol) of 
freshly distilled allyl bromide, b.p. 70-71 °C (Expt 5.54) and 226 g (2.52 mol) 
of dry copper(i) cyanide (Section 4.2.25, p. 429). Warm the flask on a water 
bath so that the allyl bromide refluxes but do not stir at this stage. Immedi- 
ately the vigorous reaction commences (after 15-30 minutes), remove the 
water bath and cool the flask in a bath of ice and water; the two double sur- 
face condensers will prevent any loss of product. When the reaction subsides, 
start the stirrer and heat the mixture on the water bath for 1 hour. Remove 
the condensers and arrange the apparatus for distillation: close one neck with 
a stopper. Heat the flask in an oil bath, and distil the allyl cyanide with stir- 
ring; it is advisable to reduce the pressure (water pump) towards the end of 
the distillation to assist the removal of the final portion of the allyl cyanide 
from the solid residue. Redistil and collect the pure allyl cyanide at 1 16— 
121 °C. The yield is 140 g (86%).

CAUTION: Note comments in Expt 5.157. 

Set up on a water bath a 500-ml three-necked flask fitted with a mechan- 
ical stirrer, a thermometer and a two-way adapter fitted with a dropping 
funnel and a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride guard-tube. 
Place 150 ml of dry dimethyl sulphoxide in the flask and add 30 g (0.61 mol) 
of dry powdered sodium cyanide. Heat the mixture with stirring to 90 °C and 
then remove the water bath. Add 46.3 g (0.5 mol) of butyl chloride (Expt 5.48) 
slowly from the dropping funnel so that the temperature of the exothermic 
reaction does not rise above 150 °C (about 10 minutes); continue to stir until 
the temperature falls to 50 °C (about 30 minutes). Pour the mixture into

water and extract with three 300 ml portions of ether. Wash the combined 
extracts with two 100 ml portions of saturated sodium chloride solution, dry 
over magnesium sulphate and distil off the ether on a water bath. Distil the 
residue at atmospheric pressure and collect the butyl cyanide at 138-140 °C; 
the yield is 35.2 g (85%). The product has a nauseating odour, and should be 
handled in an efficient fume cupboard. 

Cognate preparations. Octanenitrile. Use 250 ml of dry dimethyl sulphoxide, 
89.6g (0.5 mol) of 1-bromoheptane (Expt 5.55) and 30g (0.61 mol) of dried 
sodium cyanide. The yield of octanenitrile is 50.8 g (81%), b.p. 199-203 °C. 

Hexanedinitrile (adiponitrile). Use 150 ml of dry dimethyl sulphoxide, 21.2 g 
(0.17 mol) of 1,4-dichlorobutane (Expt 5.52) and 20g (0.41 mol) of dried 
sodium cyanide. Maintain the reaction temperature at 90 °C for a further 15 
minutes after the initial exothermic reaction has subsided. Add 150 ml of 
dichloromethane to the cooled reaction mixture and pour into an excess of 
saturated sodium chloride solution in a separatory funnel. Add just sufficient 
water to dissolve precipitated salts and separate the dichloromethane layer. 
Extract the acqueous layer once with dichloromethane, wash the combined 
extracts twice with salt solution, dry over magnesium sulphate and remove 
the solvent using a rotary evaporator. Fractionally distil the residue under 
reduced pressure and collect the adiponitrile as a fraction of b.p. 140-141 °C/ 
1.5mmHg. The yield is 14.6g (81%). Some dimethyl sulphoxide (b.p. 40- 
42°C/1.5mmHg) may be obtained as a forerun.

CAUTION: Potassium cyanide is very poisonous and should only be handled 
with great care with the wearing of plastic gloves. See Note (1), Expt 5.157, for 
the disposal of alkali metal cyanides. All operations should be conducted in an 
efficient fume cupboard. 

Cyclopentanone (1.7 g, 20mmol) and 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulphonyl

converts the acid chloride into the nitrile in a one-pot reaction; the reagent is sul-

Some of these procedures are exemplified in Expt 5.160. Dehydration of

Me 2 CH-CONH 2 7^ Me 2 CH-CN 

Equip a 2-litre round-bottomed flask with a simple distillation head carrying 
a capillary air leak, and attach a double surface condenser fitted with a 
receiver adapter with vacuum connection and a 100-ml receiver flask. 
Remove the still-head, wrap some glazed paper around a glass tube and insert 
it into the flask neck until the lower end enters the bulb of the flask; upon 
removing the glass tube, the paper roll expands and thus lines the neck of the 
flask. Weigh out on pieces of glazed paper first 65 g (0.75 mol) of 2-methyl- 
propanamide (isobutyramide, Expt 5.154) and then, as rapidly as possible 
because of its extremely hygroscopic character, 1 14 g (0.8 mol) of phosphorus 
pentoxide (1). Immediately transfer, with the aid of a spatula, the phosphorus 
pentoxide down the glazed paper cylinder into the flask, then introduce the 
acid amide similarly, remove the paper, stopper the flask and mix the con- 
tents well by gentle shaking (2). Attach the flask to the distillation set-up and 
heat the flask cautiously with a luminous flame kept in constant motion and 
applied uniformly over the bottom of the flask. A reaction accompanied by 
much frothing takes place. After the reaction has subsided, apply the vacuum 
provided by a water-jet pump carefully and continue heating at such a rate 
that the isopropyl cyanide distils smoothly. Redistil the product from 10 g of 
phosphorus pentoxide in a flask fitted with a short Vigreux column and 
heated in an oil bath maintained at 145-155 °C; collect the pure product, b.p. 
101-102 °C. The yield is 37 g (73%). 

Notes. (1) Phosphorus pentoxide must be treated with great care since it produces 
painful burns if allowed to come in contact with the skin. 

(2) Wet the papers thoroughly with water before throwing them away, as the residual 
phosphorus pentoxide may cause them to smoulder. 

Cognate preparations. Hexanenitrile {pentyl cyanide). (Use of thionyl chlor- 
ide.) Place 29 g (0.25 mol) of hexanamide (Expt 5.154) in a 100-ml flask fitted 
with a reflux condenser, add 45 g (27.5 ml, 0.38 mol) of redistilled thionyl 
chloride and connect the top of the condenser to a gas absorption device 

716

[Fig. 2.61(a) or (fc)]. Boil the mixture gently under reflux for 1 hour. Remove 
the reflux condenser and arrange it for downward distillation. Distil from an 
oil bath or an air bath; the excess thionyl chloride passes over below 90 °C. If 
the residue at this stage is dark and contains some solid matter, add a little 
anhydrous ether, filter, and remove the ether on a rotatory evaporator. Distil 
the crude hexanenitrile as a fraction of b.p. 161-163 °C. The yield is 21 g 
(86%). If the product is slightly turbid, shake it with a little anhydrous cal- 
cium sulphate, filter, and redistil. 

General procedure for the one-pot conversion of acid chlorides into nitriles. 1 73 

Heat a mixture of 0.01 mol of the acid chloride and 0.01 2 mol of sulphona- 
mide in 10 ml of sulpholane for 3 hours at 120°C. After cooling, pour the 
reaction mixture into 75 ml of 1 m sodium hydroxide solution and extract 
three times with ether-cyclohexane (1:1). Wash the organic layer three times 
with water to remove traces of sulpholane, dry over anhydrous sodium sul- 
phate and evaporate to give the almost pure product. Distil under reduced 
pressure or recrystallise as appropriate. 

5.13.4 CYANOETHYLATION PROCEDURES AND THE a-ALKYLATION OF NITRILES 

Cyanoethylation is an important method for the introduction of a three-carbon 
residue in the form of a 2-cyanoethyl group ( — CH 2 - CH 2 - CN), and conveniently 
leads to a range of polyfunctional compounds. ' 74 Disconnection in the manner 
shown in the retrosynthetic summary (p. 711) emphasises that this fragment 
arises from acrylonitrile, which undergoes a Michael 1,4-addition process with a 
range of nucleophilic addenda including carbanions, alcohols and amines. The 
first is illustrated by the reaction of acrylonitrile with diethylmalonate in the 
presence of sodium ethoxide to form diethyl (2-cyanoethyl)malonate (Expt 
5.161). The mechanism of the reaction may be readily inferred from that given 
for the synthesis of a-alkylglutaric acids (Expt 5.136 and p. 682). Other car- 
banion sources include nitroalkanes, aldehydes and ketones, all of which must 
possess an a-hydrogen. Experimental conditions are given for the cyanoethyl- 
ation of primary alcohols (Expt 5.162) and of secondary aliphatic amines (Expt 
5.163); the reaction is equally applicable to phenols, thiols, ammonia, primary 
amines, etc.

Anion exchange resins of the quaternary ammonium hydroxide type [e.g. 
Zerolit FF or Amberlite (IRA-400)] are strong bases and are useful catalysts for 
cyanoethylation of alcohols. No additional basic catalyst is normally required in 
the case of the cyanoethylation of aliphatic amines. 

As noted above in Section 5.13.1 the cyano group may be easily converted 
into other functionalities. The a-alkylation of a nitrile (1) by treatment with an 
appropriate base followed by reaction with an alkyl halide enables an oe- 
branched chain aldehyde (2) or carboxylic acid (3), or a ^-branched chain prim- 
ary amine (4) to be readily synthesised. Furthermore an a-branched chain 
nitrile, or the corresponding acid or aldehyde may be further elaborated into an 

717 




5.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



a-branched chain ketone (5) (see for example, Sections 5.8.4, p. 616, and 5.4.2, 
p. 531 with 5.8.1, p. 607). 



OH 




In particular the synthesis of an a-alkylaldehyde or branched chain ketone by 
this overall strategy is of considerable merit since some of the problems asso- 
ciated with the a-alkylation of an enolate ion are largely avoided (e.g. competing 
aldol condensation in the case of an aldehyde, or polyalkylation and low regio- 
selective alkylation in the case of a ketone). 

Strong bases in an aprotic medium are used to generate a high concentration 
of the mesomeric anion of the nitrile, since this restricts the degree of dialkyl- 
ation which otherwise might occur. The alkylation reagents may be primary or 
secondary alkyl bromides or iodides, or alkylsulphonates. l75a The PTC pro- 
cedure using concentrated sodium hydroxide solution with a phase transfer 
catalyst (e.g. benzyltriethylammonium chloride) is a particularly effective 
method for the a-alkylation of arylacetonitriles (ArCH 2 -CN). l75b

CAUTION: Acrylonitrile vapour is highly toxic; it should therefore be handled 
with great caution and all operations with it should be conducted in a fume cup- 
board provided with an efficient extraction system. 

Assemble in a fume cupboard a 1 -litre three-necked flask containing 480 g 
(455 ml, 3 mol) of diethyl malonate and fitted with a stirrer, a dropping funnel 
and a thermometer. Start the stirrer, add to the flask a solution of sodium 
ethoxide prepared from 3.5 g of sodium in 100 ml of absolute ethanol and 
then run in slowly 80 g ( 1 00 ml, 1 . 5 mol) of acrylonitrile ( 1 ) (CAUTION: toxic 
and lachrymatory vapour) at a rate such that the temperature does not exceed 
35 °C. When the addition is complete, continue to stir for 1 hour more and 
then remove the stirrer. Equip the flask for distillation under reduced pres- 
sure through a short fractionating column (cf. Fig. 2.110) and remove the 
ethanol by distillation using a water pump. Continue the distillation of the 
residue using an oil pump at a recorded pressure of about 0.2mmHg, and 
collect (i) recovered diethyl malonate at 52 °C (240 g), and (ii) somewhat 
crude diethyl (2-cyanoethyl)malonate at 130-1 40 °C (200 g). Redistil the 
latter to obtain 175 g (55%) of the purified product of b.p. 102-106 °C/

neutral and dry in the air. In a 500-ml three-necked flask equipped with a 
reflux condenser, stirrer and a dropping funnel, place 25 g of the regenerated 
resin and 46 g (58.5 ml, 1 mol) of ethanol. Immerse the flask in an ice bath to 
control the subsequent initial exothermic reaction and to hold the temperat- 
ure below 15-20°C throughout the experiment. Add 67 g (85 ml, 1.26 mol) of 
redistilled acrylonitrile [CAUTION: see Expt 5.161} slowly to the well- 
stirred mixture in the flask over a period of 1-2 hours; continue the stirring 
for a further 1.5 hours. Separate the resin by filtration. Distil the filtrate at 
atmospheric pressure to 100 °C in order to remove unreacted acrylonitrile

5.14.1 HALOGENO ACIDS 

HALOGENATION OF A CARBOXYLIC ACID 




Acetic acid can be chlorinated by gaseous chlorine in the presence of red phos- 
phorus to yield successively mono-, di- and trichloroacetic acid (CH 2 0-C0 2 H, 
CHC1 2 -C0 2 H and CC1 3 -C0 2 H) respectively. This represents the most conveni- 
ent commercial method for the formation of these acids. Chlorination of other 
aliphatic carboxylic acids is not usually of preparative value since mixtures of 
several monochlorinated products are obtained. Bromination, on the other 
hand, is highly selective and only the a-bromo acid is obtained when the reac- 
tion is carried out in the presence of a reagent which yields an acyl bromide, such 
as red phosphorus (the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction) or phosphorus tri- 
chloride or tribromide. The acyl bromide undergoes halogenation (in the De- 
position) much more readily than the parent acid.

Illustrative procedures are given in Expt 5.165 which also includes typical details 
for the transformation of the substituted acid chloride into the corresponding 
amide and carboxylic acid. 

When it is required to prepare an a-bromo acid from a carboxylic acid which 
is not particularly readily available commercially, but which can be synthesised 
by the malonic acid route (Section 5. 1 1.6, p. 680), advantage may be taken of the 
ease of bromination in the a-position of the intermediate alkylmalonic acid. The 
substituted bromomalonic acid undergoes ready decarboxylation on heating to 
yield the a-bromo acid (e.g. 2-bromo-3-methylpentanoic acid, Expt 5.166).

HYDROGEN HALIDE ADDITION TO AN UNSATURATED CARB- 
OXYLIC ACID 




A halogeno acid will be formed when an unsaturated carboxylic acid undergoes 
addition of a halogen acid. In the case of a,/?-unsaturated acids, the addition pro- 
cess yields the /Mialogeno acid; when the double bond is more remote from the 
carboxyl group a mixture of regioisomers is likely to be obtained as a result of 
competing orientation effects and the process may have little preparative value. 
In the particular case of peroxide-catalysed addition of hydrogen bromide to a 
long-chain unsaturated acid having a terminal double bond, the reaction is 
essentially regiospecific and the product is an co-bromoacid. This procedure is 
illustrated in Expt 5.65. 

RING OPENING OF LACTONES 

As noted in Section 5.14.2, p. 728, lactones may be readily prepared by the 
Baeyer-Villiger oxidative rearrangement of cyclic ketones, most usually of ring 
size of five carbon atoms or larger. Ring opening of these lactones with concen- 
trated hydrobromic acid in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid gives 
directly the a,co-bromo acids (e.g. 6-bromohexanoic acid from 6-hexanolide, 
Expt 5.167, which further describes the esterification of the product). The reac- 
tion may proceed by (a) hydrolysis to the hydroxy acid followed by an Sjy2 dis- 
placement of the hydroxyl group with bromine, or (b) by an alkyl-oxygen fission 
of the protonated lactone arising from direct attack of a bromide ion.

Place 100 g (107 ml, 0.86 mol) of freshly distilled, dry hexanoic acid (b.p. 202-

(CAUTION) in a 500-ml flask equipped with a reflux condenser, the top of 
which is connected to a gas absorption device [compare Fig. 2.61(c)]. 
Momentarily remove the condenser and add cautiously 1.5 ml of phosphorus 
trichloride. Heat the mixture on a water bath to 65-70 °C, when reaction will 
commence and hydrogen bromide is smoothly evolved. Towards the end of 
the reaction allow the temperature of the bath to rise to 100 °C. The reaction 
is complete when all the bromine has reacted (about 4 hours). Distil the reac- 
tion mixture under reduced pressure using a water pump; much hydrogen 
bromide is evolved and a fraction of low boiling point passes over. When all 
the low boiling point fraction has distilled, connect the flask to an oil pump 
via a trap containing sodium hydroxide pellets and collect the 2-bromo- 
hexanoic acid at 116-125 °C/8mmHg (or at 132-140°C/15mmHg). The yield 
is 145 g (86%). Upon redistillation the 2-bromohexanoic acid passes over 
almost entirely at 128-131 °C/10mmHg. 

Note. (1) The acid may be dried by adding toluene and distilling out the toluene- 
water azeotrope, before distilling the dried acid.

Hexanoic acid (11. 6g, 0.1 mol) and thionyl chloride (28.8ml, 0.4mol) are 
placed in a 250-ml flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar and a condenser 
with a drying tube (CAUTION: hydrogen chloride evolved). The reaction mix- 
ture is stirred and heated in a 70 °C oil bath. After 0.5 hour, a portion of the 
reaction mixture is submitted to p.m.r measurement, which shows the dis- 
appearance of the triplet at 8 2.40 ( — CH 2 -C0 2 H) and the emergence of a 
new triplet at 8 2.87 ( — CH 2 COCl). The flask is removed from the oil bath 
and cooled to room temperature. To the reaction mixture are added success- 
ively finely powdered JV-chlorosuccinimide (26.7 g, 0.2 mol), thionyl chloride 
(20 ml) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (7 drops). The flask is then 
returned to the oil bath, the temperature of which is raised to 85 °C. The 
actual temperature of the reaction mixture is 70 °C. After 1.25 hours, the reac- 
tion is over, as indicated by the disappearance of the triplet at 8 2.87 and the 
emergence of two doublets at 4.77-4.55 (— CHC1-COC1). The solvent is 
removed under reduced pressure and the solid (succinimide) is collected and 
washed with tetrachloromethane. The filtrate is fractionally distilled to give 
1 4.7 g (87%) of product, b.p. 1 74-1 76 °C/760 mmHg; n D 1 .4458; i.r. (neat) 1 787

pH paper (10 minutes). Ether is evaporated, and the white precipitate (0.7 g, 
quantitative yield) is washed with ice-cold water, then sublimed at 30 °C/ 
0.05 mmHg; m.p. 56-57 °C. 

Cognate preparations. 2-Bromohexanoyl chloride and 2-bromohexanoic acid. 

A mixture of hexanoic acid (11. 6g, 0.1 mol), tetrachloromethane (10ml) and 
thionyl chloride (28.8 ml, 0.4 mol) is stirred at 65 °C for 0.5 hour. JV-Bromo- 
succinimide (21.4 g, 0.12 mol), tetrachloromethane (50 ml) and 48 per cent 
hydrobromic acid (7 -drops) are added to the mixture. The flask is heated at 
70 °C for 10 minutes, then at 85 °C for 1.5 hours. After work-up and fractional 
distillation in vacuo, 2-bromohexanoyl chloride is obtained as a clear, slightly 
yellow oil (17.1 g, 80%), b.p. 44-47 °C/ 1.5 mmHg. Hydrolysis to the acid is 
achieved by treating its acetone solution (92 ml) with 115 ml of a saturated

ature of the reaction mixture is 85 °C. The reaction was complete after 1.5 
hours, as indicated by p.m.r. measurement which was performed and ana- 
lysed in the same way as with previous experiments. Thionyl chloride is evap- 
orated under reduced pressure; excess iodine is filtered and washed with 
tetrachloromethane. The filtrate is shaken with concentrated sodium thio- 
sulphate solution to remove the remaining iodine. The organic layer is separ- 
ated and dried over magnesium sulphate. After solvent evaporation, the 
product is distilled to yield 21 g (80%) of 2-idohexanoyl chloride, b.p. 62-

and when this has reacted completely drop in the remainder of the bromine at 
such a rate that the ether refluxes gently. When all the bromine has reacted, 
add 100 ml of water cautiously from the dropping funnel to decompose any

5.14.2 HYDROXY ACIDS AND LACTONES 

Lactones are formally products of the intramolecular cyclisation of hydroxy 
acids, e.g. 



-h 2 o 





Lactonisation is an internal esterification process which in the case of y- and 8- 
hydroxy acids takes place particularly readily, often simply on standing. Experi- 
mental conditions must therefore be carefully controlled if the free hydroxy acid 
is to be isolated from the reaction medium. Smaller or larger lactones cannot 
generally be prepared by direct intramolecular esterification; formation of linear 
polyesters can be a competing reaction and macrocyclic lactones have to be pre- 
pared by indirect routes. /^-Hydroxy acids dehydrate to oe,/?-unsaturated acids 
rather than undergoing lactonisation. The three-membered lactone ring system 
is not known in the free state but a-lactones are believed to be the intermediates 
in the hydrolysis of a-halo acids, where a neighbouring group participation 
effect markedly increases the rate of hydrolysis. In the case of chiral a-halo acids 
the retention of configuration provides evidence for this mechanistic pathway.

/?- Lactones and the macrocyclic lactones, like the y- and ^-lactones, are of im- 
portance since these ring systems are found widespread in nature. The simpler 
substituted lactones are important building blocks in the synthesis of many 
natural products, e.g. in the fields of antibiotics, anticancer pharmaceuticals, 
pheromones and prostaglandins to name but a few. 

725 



5.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



a-HYDROXY ACIDS 

As noted above, the hydrolysis of a-halogeno acids proceeds particularly read- 
ily, usually in boiling aqueous sodium carbonate solution. The preparation of 
the lower homologous a-hydroxy acids by this procedure, however, is not en- 
tirely satisfactory because the highly water-soluble and sometimes hygroscopic 
products are difficult to isolate efficiently. One method consists of treating an 
aqueous solution of the hydroxy acid with copper(n) acetate to precipitate the 
insoluble copper salt and decomposing an aqueous suspension of the latter with 
hydrogen sulphide. 177 The recovery of the a-hydroxy acid, however, is often 
poor. 

A more generally satisfactory method is the hydrolysis of cyanohydrins. Here 
a mixture of the carbonyl compound and aqueous sodium cyanide is gradually 
acidified at room temperature resulting in the sequential formation of the cyano- 
hydrin and its subsequent hydrolysis to the acid (the cyano group is of course a 
latent carboxyl group). 

h,o® 
R'R 2 CO + HCN &gt; R'R 2 C(OH)-CN -^-^ R'R 2 C(OH)-C0 2 H 

An alternative procedure, suitable for the preparation of cyanohydrins which 
readily form bisulphite complexes, is illustrated by the preparation of mandelic 
acid described in Expt 5.168 (see also the preparation of acetone cyanohydrin). 
Here the procedure involves the addition of a saturated solution of sodium 
metabisulphite to a stirred solution of the carbonyl compound and aqueous 
sodium cyanide, and when applicable is usually to be preferred to the in situ 
generation of hydrogen cyanide or the use of the highly poisonous liquid hydro- 
gen cyanide as a reagent. 

The synthesis of optically active isomers of a-hydroxy acids is important since 
these acids are present in nature and they are also important intermediates in 
organic synthesis. The methods which have been used for their preparation 
(with varying success with respect to optical purity), include the asymmetric 
reduction of a-keto esters followed by hydrolysis (for acids of the type 
R-CHOH-C0 2 H), 178 and the reaction of Grignard reagents with optically 
active a-keto esters, 179 or optically active keto oxazolines [for acids of the type 
R 1 -C(R 2 )(OH)-C0 2 H]. 180 An interesting preparative example given here is the 
novel use of an asymmetric halolactonisation reaction ' 8 ' (see also p. 729). In 
this reaction a suitable a,/?-unsaturated acid is first converted into the acyl 
derivative (5) of (S)-proline (the chiral adjuvant, p. 15). Treatment of this 
derivative with JV-bromosuccinimide in dimethylformamide gives a bromonium 
ion which lactonises to the bromolactone (6); reduction of (6) with tributyltin 
hydride yields the lactone (7) from which the optically active a-hydroxy acid 
(89-98% ee) is released by hydrolysis. The reaction sequence formulated below 
only gives the preferred conformations and the stereoselective routes that are 
suggested in the literature; the full account should be consulted for a detailed 
discussion of other, less likely, stereoisomeric possibilities. When tiglic acid [(£)- 
2-methylbut-2-enoic acid] is employed the product, (/?)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl- 
butanoic acid is formed in high optical purity (Expt 5.169).

As noted previously (p. 519) the reagent equivalent for the carbocation (8) is an 
aldehyde [or ketone in the case of a hydroxy ester target molecule of structure 
R 1 R^-C(OH)-CH 2 -C0 2 R]. For the anionic synthon (9), the use of a base gener- 
ated a-carbanion (e.g. from an ester, from diethyl malmonate, or from malonic 
acid) would lead to spontaneous base-catalysed dehydration of the product to 
give the oe,/?-unsaturated ester or acid (Section 5.18.3, p. 804); subsequently 
further Michael addition reactions may also take place (Section 5.1 1.6, p. 681). 
Therefore, to arrest the reaction at the hydroxy ester stage, the carbanion source 
is the organozinc reagent as shown, which reacts similarly to a Grignard 
reagent, but is chemoselective in that it reacts with the carbonyl group of alde- 
hydes and ketones but not esters. This is known as the Reformatsky reaction, 
(Expt 5.70).

The success of the reaction is crucially dependent on the cleanliness of the zinc 
surface, prior to the formation of the organozinc reagent; 'sonication' has been 
suggested as a valuable aid to this reaction (cf. Expt 7.14). Under standard con- 
ditions, the hydroxy ester is the major product when the reaction is carried out 
in ether or benzene; the contaminants which frequently arise during distillation 
are the a,/?- and /?,y-unsaturated esters. Dehydration can be deliberately effected 
with the aid of reagents such as fused potassium hydrogen sulphate or acetic 
anhydride. Catalytic hydrogenation of the mixture of unsaturated esters fol-

constitutes a useful two-carbon chain extension process. 

Methyl 4-bromobut-2-enoate (BrCH 2 - CH=CH-C0 2 Me, a vinyl analogue 
of ethyl bromoacetate, Expt 5.69) can also be used in the Reformatsky reaction, 
and its use permits an analogous four-carbon atom chain extension process. 

y-, S-, AND co-HYDROXY ACIDS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE LACTONES 

One of the most important methods for lactone preparation, and hence of the 
corresponding hydroxy acids (or halogeno acids, Section 5.14.1 above) is the 
Baeyer- Villiger rearrangment of cyclic ketones by the action of peracids. A wide 
variety of peracids have been used in this reaction but currently the reagents of 
choice are pertrifluoroacetic acid, m-chloroperbenzoic acid, and permaleic acid. 
The mechanism is formulated below for the conversion of an acyclic ketone into 
an ester.

The migratory aptitudes of the groups is in the order t-alkyl &gt; s-alkyl &gt; aryl &gt; 
n-alkyl &gt; methyl. With cyclic ketones, leading to lactones, the more highly sub- 
stituted group migrates. As with all intramolecular rearrangements if the migrat- 
ing group is chiral, configuration is retained. The reaction is therefore 
regioselective and stereospecific.

A range of conditions has been selected in Expt 5.171 to illustrate this reaction. 
Thus, m-chloroperbenzoic is used with many cyclic ketones although the time of 
reaction increases with ring size, 182 pertrifluoroacetic acid in buffer solution is 
used in relatively small-scale oxidations and with less reactive ketones, 183 and 
permaleic acid appears suitable in large-scale oxidations where safety pre- 
cautions preclude the use of 90 per cent hydrogen peroxide (permaleic acid is 
generated from maleic anhydride and the somewhat safer 30 per cent 
reagent). 184 The conditions used with the former two reagents have been widely 
employed for the conversion of variously substituted monocyclic and fused ring 
ketones into important lactone products. 185 Details are also given for the 
conversion of the lactones so prepared into co-hydroxy acids by hydrolysis and 
into co-iodo acids by treatment with hydriodic acid. An alternative convenient 
procedure for the formation of co-iodo acids from lactones is reaction with tri- 
chloromethylsilane/sodium iodide in dry acetonitrile. 76b

lactonisation reaction) 186 is an important reaction which has been widely used in 
natural product synthesis. 187 The simplest example is the conversion of pent-4- 
enoic acid into the iodolactone (1 1) by dissolution in aqueous sodium hydrogen 
carbonate followed by treatment with an aqueous solution of iodine in potas- 
sium iodide, the reaction proceeding via the intermediate iodonium cation (10).

The illustrative preparative example is the conversion of cyclohex-1-en-l-yl- 
acetic acid into the y-iodolactone (12) (cis-l-iodo-7-oxabicyclo[4.3.0]nona-8- 
one, 188 Expt 5.172). In general the simpler iodolactones tend to be unstable; the 
preparative sequence therefore recommends conversion into the unsaturated 
lactone by a dehydrohalogenation reaction. 

Optically active lactones have been synthesised by an adaptation of the oxa- 
zoline route to optically active carboxylic acids 189 (Section 5.11.7, p. 687).

CAUTION: This preparation must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard. 
Prepare a saturated solution of sodium metabisulphite by stirring 250 g of 
finely powdered sodium metabisulphite with 335 ml of water for half an hour 
and then filtering to remove excess of the salt. In a 1 -litre three-necked flask 
equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel, place a solution of 
25 g (0.5 mol) of sodium cyanide (CAUTION) in 100 ml of water and 53 g 
(51 ml, 0.5 mol) of purified benzaldehyde (Expt 6.133). Add the sodium meta- 
bisulphite solution from the dropping funnel, slowly at first and then more 
rapidly (the addition occupies 10—15 minutes). During the initial stages of the 
addition, add 1 50 g of crushed ice to the reaction mixture in several portions 
through the third neck. Transfer the two-layer liquid mixture to a separatory 
funnel and remove the crude mandelonitrile (1). Place the crude product at 
once (2) in a large evaporating dish, add 75 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid, cover with a clock glass and allow the hydrolysis to proceed at room 
temperature for 12 hours. Evaporate the solution to dryness on a steam bath, 
stirring from time to time to break up the deposit of ammonium chloride and 
mandelic acid which separates. Grind the residue of slightly discoloured man- 
delic acid and inorganic salts to a fine powder and wash it with two portions 
of 125 ml of cold benzene (CAUTION); this process will remove most of the 
colouring matter but a negligible quantity of mandelic acid. To separate the 
inorganic salts from the mandelic acid, extract the residue in a Soxhlet appar- 
atus (Fig. 2.97) with about 200 ml of benzene. Allow the hot benzene extract 
to crystallise, collect the crystals on a Buchner funnel and dry in air. The yield 
of pure (±)-mandelic acid, m.p. 118 °C, is 35 g (46%).

5.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Note. (1) For the safe disposal of the aqueous solution see Expt 5.158. A further small 
quantity of mandelonitrile may be obtained by extracting the aqueous solution with 
ether, evaporating the ether and adding the residue to the main portion of mandelo- 
nitrile. This extraction is hardly worth while except for large-scale preparations. 
(2) It is important to mix the mandelonitrile with hydrochloric acid immediately it has 
been separated from the water. Standing results in rapid conversion to the acetal of 
benzaldehyde and mandelonitrile Ph-CH[OCH(CN)'Ph] 2 ; the yield of mandelic acid 
will, in consequence, be reduced. 

Cognate preparation. Acetone cyanohydrin. Dissolve 1 10 g of sodium metabi- 
sulphite in 200 ml of cold water contained in a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask. 
Add slowly 58 g of acetone while swirling the liquid mixture slowly, followed 
by a solution of 60 g of potassium cyanide in 200 ml of cold water 
(CAUTION). During this latter slow addition the cyanohydrin separates as 
the upper layer. When separation is complete the contents of the flask are 
transferred to a separatory funnel and the lower layer removed. The upper 
layer is transferred to a flask, sodium sulphate added to effect drying and the 
flask stoppered and kept in the dark. The dried cyanohydrin (60 g, 70%) is 
slightly discoloured; it may be distilled under reduced pressure when it distils 
at 80-82°C/15mmHg.

an ice bath, and the resulting alkaline solution is diluted with acetone (53 ml). 
An acetone solution (53ml) of tigloyl chloride (16.0g, 0.135 mol) and 2m 
sodium hydroxide solution (80 ml, 0.1 60 mol) are simultaneously added over 
70 minutes to the aqueous solution of (S)-proline with stirring in an ice bath. 
The pH of the mixture is kept at 10-11 during the addition of the acylating 
reagent. After the addition, stirring is continued for 2 hours at room temper- 
ature and the mixture is submitted to evaporation in vacuo to remove the 
acetone. The residual solution is washed with ether and acidified (pH 2) with 
concentrated hydrochloric acid. The acidic mixture is extracted with ethyl 
acetate after being saturated with sodium chloride, and the combined ethyl

Bromolactonisation of (5)-7V-TigIoyIproIine. A dimethylformamide solution 
(4 ml) of potassium t-butoxide (224 mg, 2.0 mmol) and a dimethylformamide 
solution (2 ml) of JV-bromosuccinimide (712mg, 4.0 mmol) are successively 
added to a stirred solution of (S)-JV-tigloylproline (395 mg, 2.0 mmol) in 
dimethylformamide (2 ml) at — 20 °C under nitrogen. The mixture is stirred 
at — 20 °C for 2 hours, and then at room temperature for 48 hours. Extractive 
isolation with ethyl acetate followed by evaporation in vacuo gives the crude 
bromolactone as a thick yellow oil (562 mg, 95%). Thin-layer chromato- 
graphy analysis (silica gel, solvent ether) of this oil shows three impurities (R F 
0.47, 0.28, and 0.22) in addition to the desired bromolactone (R F 0.36). The 
pure bromolactone is obtained by recrystallisation from hexane-ether and

Reductive debromination of bromolactone. A benzene solution (12 ml) of tri-

minute to a stirred solution of pure bromolactone (1.70 g, 6. 16 mmol) in ben- 
zene (10 ml) at 70 °C under nitrogen. The mixture is stirred at reflux for 15

It is essential that all the apparatus and the reagents be scrupulously dry for 
successful results (compare Grignard reaction). Equip a 500-ml three-necked 
flask with a 250-ml separatory funnel, a mechanical stirrer and a double sur- 
face condenser; insert calcium chloride guard-tubes in the funnel and con- 
denser. Place 40 g (0.61 mol) of zinc dust (previously dried at 100 °C) (Section 
4.2.50, p. 467) in the flask, and a solution of 83.5 g (55.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of ethyl 
bromoacetate (CAUTION: lachrymatory) (1) and 65 g (62 ml, 0.615 mol) of 
purified benzaldehyde (Expt 6.133) in 80 ml of sodium-dried benzene and 
20 ml of sodium-dried ether in the separatory funnel. Add about 10 ml of the 
solution to the zinc and warm the flask gently until the reaction starts. When 
the reaction has commenced, but not before, stir the mixture and add the re- 
mainder of the solution at such a rate that moderate refluxing occurs (about 1 
hour). Reflux the reaction mixture on a water bath for a further 30 minutes. 
Cool the flask in an ice bath, and add 200 ml of cold 10 per cent sulphuric acid 
with vigorous stirring. Transfer to a separatory funnel, remove the aqueous 
layer, wash the benzene layer twice with 50 ml portions of 5 per cent sulphuric 
acid, once with 25 ml of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution and finally 
with two 25 ml portions of water. Extract the combined solutions with 100 ml 
of ether, and dry the combined benzene and ether solution with 5 g of anhyd- 
rous calcium sulphate. Filter from the desiccant, remove the solvent by distil- 
lation under atmospheric pressure and distil the residue under reduced 
pressure. Collect the ethyl 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropanoate at 152-1 54 °C/ 
12mmHg. The yield is 60 g (62%). 

Note. (1) Great care must be exercised in handling ethyl bromoacetate. Keep a 10 per 
cent aqueous ammonia solution available to react with any bromoester which may be 
spilled. 

Cognate preparation. Ethyl l'-hydroxycyclohexylacetate. Place 65g(lmol) 
of clean dry zinc dust and a few crystals of iodine in a 2.5-litre three-necked 
flask, equipped with an efficient reflux condenser with drying tube, a mechan- 
ical stirrer and a dropping funnel. Prepare a mixture of 400 ml of sodium- 
dried benzene and 350 ml of sodium-dried toluene with 167 g (111 ml, 1 mol) 
of ethyl bromoacetate and 98 g (103.5 ml, 1 mol) of pure dried and redistilled 
cyclohexanone. Transfer 150 ml of this mixture to the flask, start the stirrer 
and heat the flask in a boiling water bath. A vigorous reaction soon sets in. 
Add the remainder of the mixture through the dropping funnel at such a rate 
that gentle refluxing is maintained. Continue the stirring for an additional 2 
hours: practically all the zinc dissolves. Cool the mixture, add sufficient 10 per 
cent sulphuric acid with stirring to dissolve all the zinc hydroxide. Separate 
the benzene-toluene layer, dry it with anhydrous sodium sulphate, remove 
the solvent using a rotary evaporator and distil the residue under reduced 
pressure. Collect ethyl l'-hydroxycyclohexylacetate at 86-89 °C/2 mmHg. 
The yield is 125g(67%).

Cyclododecanone (2.0 g, 1 1 mmol) is added to m-chloroperbenzoic acid 
(4.2 g, 21 mmol) in 25 ml of dry chloroform (CAUTION). The reaction mix- 
ture is heated at reflux for 48 hours after which time a starch-iodide test for 
peroxide is negative. After the mixture is cooled in ice-water, the precipitated 
m-chlorobenzoic acid is removed by filtration and the chloroform is evapor- 
ated to dryness. The residue is taken up in 60 ml of ether, washed three times 
with 20-ml portions of aqueous potassium carbonate, and once with brine. 
After drying and removal of solvent there remains crude dodecanolide (1.9 g, 
9.6 mmol, 87%), which is used without further purification. 

Conversion into 12-iodododecanoic acid. The above dodecanolide (1.9 g, 
9.6 mmol) is added to a mixture of 67 per cent hydriodic acid (5g, 24 mmol) 
and glacial acetic acid (3 g). The reaction mixture is held for 2 hours at 100 °C 
and after cooling is poured out into 50 ml of a cold 10 per cent aqueous solu- 
tion of sodium thiosulphate. The reaction mixture is extracted three times 
with 25-ml portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are dried over 
magnesium sulphate, and the solvent is removed to leave crude 12-iododode- 
canoic acid, which after recrystallisation from ether-light petroleum (b.p. 40- 
60 °C) is obtained in 93 per cent yield (2.95 g), m.p. 61-62.5 °C. 

Cognate preparations. Dodecanolide (use ofpermaleic acid).' 84 (CAUTION: 
see Section ¥.2.41, p. 439 for the precautions that must be adopted when using 
30 per cent hydrogen peroxide. Safety screens and extra personal protection 
measures should also be employed.) Dichloromethane (1.6 litres) and acetic 
anhydride (1.25 litres) are stirred in a 5-litre flask fitted with a double surface 
condenser and an overhead stirrer, a dropping funnel, and cooled externally 
(ice-water) while 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide (1 litre) is added. After 1 hour 
maleic anhydride (1 kg) is added, the mixture is cooled and stirred for 1 hour, 
and then the cooling bath is removed, when the temperature rises during 1.5 
hours and the mixture begins to reflux. External cooling is resumed when 
needed to moderate the reaction. When little more heat is evolved, cyclo- 
dodecanone (250 g) is added; this does not greatly increase the rate of heating, 
and when spontaneous refluxing ceases, a heating mantle is used to maintain 
the mixture at its boiling point for 15 hours. The mixture is then cooled and 
the separated maleic acid is filtered off. The filtrate is washed in turn with 
water (3 x 600 ml), an aqueous solution containing 10 per cent each of potas- 
sium hydroxide and sodium sulphite (2 x 300 ml), and then water (600 ml); 
tests for peroxide are now negative. After being dried over anhydrous sodium 
sulphate the filtrate is evaporated to give the lactone (210.4 g, 77%); when 
potassium carbonate, rather than potassium hydroxide, is used for washing, 
the crude lactone contains a pungent contaminant, possibly peracetic acid. 

Conversion into 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid. The foregoing lactone is added 
to a solution of potassium hydroxide (150g) in methanol (800 ml) and the

5.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. Most of the solvent is then removed 
on a rotary evaporator. Water (2 litres) is added and the solution is extracted 
with ether (2 x 400 ml). The aqueous layer is acidified (concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid) and the precipitated acid is collected, dried in vacuo, and recrys- 
tallised from acetone-light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) to afford the acid 
(185.8 g, 63% from cyclododecanone), m.p. 84 °C. 

8-Hydroxynonanoic acid lactone. 1 * 2, (CAUTION: see Section 4.2.41 for the 
precautions to be adopted in the use of 90% hydrogen peroxide. Safety screens 
and extra personal protection must be employed.) To a mixture of 90 per cent 
hydrogen peroxide (1ml, 40mmol) and dichloro methane (5 ml) at 0°C is 
added dropwise trifluoroacetic acid (7 ml, 50mmol). The resulting homo- 
geneous solution could be stored at — 20 °C for several weeks. To a solution 
of 2-methylcyclooctanone (1.12 g, 8 mmol) (1) in dichloromethane (8 ml) and 
buffered with anhydrous disodium hydrogen phosphate (7.1 g, 50 mmol), is 
added at °C dropwise pertrifluoroacetic acid solution (7 ml, 22 mmol). The 
resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 5 hours, poured into 
water, washed with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and dried over 
magnesium sulphate. After removal of the solvents at reduced pressure, the 
oily residue is flash chromatographed using 4 per cent ethyl acetate in light 
petroleum to yield 890 mg (72%) of the lactone as a transparent sweet-

Note. (1) 2-Methylcyclooctanone may be prepared by the procedures noted in earlier 
sections. Thus cyclooctanone may be converted into 1-methylcyclooctanol by reac- 
tion with methylmagnesium bromide (cf. Expt 5.40); dehydration then gives 1-methyl- 
cyclooct-1-ene (cf. Expt 5.12); hydroboration gives frans-2-methylcyclooctanol (cf. 
Expt 5.44); finally, oxidation with PCC yields 2-methylcyclooctanone (cf. Expt 5.76,

acidic hydrolysis to the unsaturated acid. An alternative method from cyclohexanone 
has been described. 191

5.14.3 KETO ACIDS AND ESTERS 

a-KETO ACIDS AND ESTERS 

The simplest member of the series of aliphatic oe-keto acids is pyruvic acid. It is 
conveniently prepared by the distillation of tartaric acid with a dehydrating 
agent such as postassium hydrogen sulphate (Expt 5.173). The reaction prob- 
ably involves dehydration to the tautomeric oxaloacetic acid (13) intermediate, 
which then decarboxylates by virtue of its constitution as a /?-keto acid. 





(13) 



A retrosynthetic disconnection of the ester of a higher homologue [e.g. (14)] 
leads to the carbanion and the carbocation synthons (15) and (16) respectively.

The reagent for the carbanion synthon (15) could be an organometallic reagent 
(RMgX or RLi), or an a-carbanion arising from a carboxylic ester. The reagent 
for the carbocation synthon (16) could be a derivative of oxalic acid [e.g. diethyl 
oxalate (C0 2 Et) 2 or ethyl oxalyl chloride (COCl-C0 2 Et)]. Two methods which 
illustrate these strategies may thus be formulated. In the first, an initial mixed 
Claisen ester condensation (see p. 738) between a carboxylic ester and diethyl 
oxalate (cf. Expt 8.37, ethyl phenyl oxaloacetate) is followed by hydrolysis to the 
keto diacid (17) and subsequent decarboxylation of the /?-keto acid function.

In the second method, ethyl oxalyl chloride is converted first into ethyl oe-oxo-

precedent for this reaction is that acylimidazolides are highly reactive towards 
Grignard reagents to yield ketones without further significant reaction with the

The yield of oe-keto ester is best when an aromatic Grignard reagent is used, and 
the reaction is illustrated by the formation of ethyl benzoylformate (Expt 5.174). 
A general route to aryl-substituted pyruvic acids (e.g. phenylpyruvic acid, 
Expt 5.175) is the acid hydrolysis of 2-acetamido-3-arylacrylic acids (19), which 
are themselves formed by hydrolysis of the corresponding azlactones (18) (cf. 
Expt 8.21) with water.

The /?-keto acids are thermally unstable and readily decompose in the presence 
of hot acid or alkali into ketones (see. Section 5.8.5, p. 617). On the other hand 
the /?-keto esters are stable and are extremely important synthetic reagents. 

The typical /?-keto ester is ethyl acetoacetate (ethyl 3-oxo-butanoate). A retro- 
synthetic disconnection on this compound points to one of the most common 
methods for its synthesis, namely the Claisen ester condensation.

The condensation proceeds under the influence of strong base catalysts of which 
sodium ethoxide is the most common example. This is usually formed from the 
ethanol present in ordinary samples of ester by the action of the sodium used in 
the condensation. The first step in the mechanism is the removal of the oe- 
hydrogen in ethyl acetate by the base catalyst to produce the mesomerically 
stabilised a-carbanion (20). The nucleophilic carbanion so formed then attacks 
the carbonyl carbon of a second ester molecule to produce the anion (21) which 
is converted into the /?-keto ester (22) by loss of an ethoxide ion. Finally (22) 
reacts with the ethoxide ion to produce the mesomerically stabilised /?-keto ester 
anion (23).

The equilibrium in the last step (iii) is far to the right because of the greater basic 
strength of the ethoxide ion compared to the anion (20), and this largely assists 
the forward reactions in (i) and (ii). The reaction product is therefore the sodio- 
derivative of the /?-keto ester from which the free ester is obtained upon careful 
acidification. 

With ethyl esters of higher straight-chain carboxylic acids (e.g. ethyl propa- 
noate, ethyl butanoate, etc.) the products are a-alkylated /?-keto esters, and the 
condensation may also be affected by the action of sodium alkoxides.

For esters with only one a-hydrogen, such as ethyl 2-methyl propanoate (ethyl 
isobutyrate), a more powerful base (e.g. sodium triphenylmethide, Ph 3 C e Na®) is 
required to affect the condensation reaction [the forced Claisen ester condensa- 
tion, e.g. the synthesis of ethyl 2,2,4-trimethyl-3-oxopentanoate (ethyl iso- 
butyrylisobutyrate), Expt 5.176]. In this case the reaction sequence is completed 
in the step corresponding to (ii) above since the /?-keto ester (24) has no a-hydro- 
gen for step (iii), and the powerful base is required to force the equilibrium (i) to 
the right.

When a mixture of two dissimilar esters (R'-CH2 - C0 2 Et and 
R 2 -CH 2 -C0 2 Et) is treated with sodium as the ethoxide, a 'mixed' /?-keto ester 
(R'-CH 2 -COCH(R 2 )-C0 2 Et or R^CH^CHCR^-COjEt) may be formed. 
However the disadvantage which is common to all mixed reactions, i.e. the 
formation of both symmetrical and crossed products, reduces its preparative 
value. Exceptions are provided in those cases where one of the esters contains no 
a-hydrogens. An important example is provided by the use of esters of oxalic 
acid in such mixed Claisen ester condensations (e.g. Section 5.14.3, p. 735, and 
Expt 8.37). 

Retrosynthetic disconnection of a /?-keto ester of the type R-COCH 2 -C0 2 Et, 
® e 

gives the carbocation R-CO and the carbanion CH 2 -C0 2 Et. The reagent equi- 
valent of the former synthon could be the acid chloride R-COC1 in place of the 
ester in the Claisen condensation above. The reagent equivalent of the car- 
banion synthon could be diethyl malonate (see Section 5.1 1.6, p. 680). The over- 
all reaction then becomes an acylation of malonic ester followed by suitable 
removal of the carbethoxy group.

One preparative procedure for achieving this reaction involves the acylation of 
the magnesium enolate of diethyl malonate with an acid chloride in benzene 
solution (cf. Expt 5.96), and the resulting aclymalonic ester is then heated to 
200 °C with an arylsulphonic acid to effect the decarbethoxylation step. An illus- 
trative example is the preparation of ethyl 3-oxopentanoate (ethyl propionyl- 
acetate, Expt 5.177). 

In an alternative method (cognate preparation in Expt 5.177), the dilithio 
complex of ethyl hydrogen malonate in tetrahydrofuran at low temperature is 
reacted with the acid chloride 194 ; the decarboxylation process takes place spon- 
taneously when the reaction mixture is quenched with dilute acid.

Convenient reagent equivalents could be a nitroalkane (for the acyl anion syn- 
thon, p. 627), and acrolein or an acrylic ester (for the carbocation). The reaction 
would then be a Michael addition process (Section 5.11.6, p. 681), followed by 
functional group modification (e.g. C — N0 2 to 0=0, p. 599, and CHO to 
C0 2 H, p. 667).

This method is illustrated (Expt 5.178) by the reaction of nitroethane with acro- 
lein in the presence of basic alumina 195 ; this catalyst apparently avoids the 
induction of undesirable side reactions. The Michael adduct is treated with 
hydrogen peroxide which effects the functional group modifications. 

The alternative charge distribution of the synthons generated in the above 

® 
disconnection leads to the acyl carbocation (R-CO) and the carbanion 
e 

CH 2 -CH 2 -C0 2 Et. From the latter the three-carbon unit of diethyl succinate 
may be recognised, and the Stobbe condensation is a suitable illustration of this 
process. Thus the reaction of aldehydes or ketones with succinic esters in the 
presence of potassium t-butoxide (or with sodium hydride) gives alkylidene- 
succinic acid esters (25). The reaction is somewhat slower in the case of the less 
basic sodium ethoxide.

When the alkylidenesuccinic ester is derived from an aldehyde [e.g. (26)], func-

Triphenylmethyl sodium. Prepare a 1.5 per cent sodium amalgam from 15 g 
(0.65 mol) of sodium and 985 g of mercury (Section 4.2.70, p. 464). Place a 
mixture of 1000 g of the amalgam and 74 g (0.265 mol) of triphenylchloro- 
methane (Section 4.2.79, p. 466) in a 2-litre Pyrex glass-stoppered bottle and 
add 1 500 ml of sodium-dried ether. Grease the glass stopper with a little Sili- 
cone grease, insert it firmly, clamp the bottle in a mechanical shaker and 
shake. CAUTION: the reaction is strongly exothermic; cool the bottle with wet 
rags and stop the shaking from time to time, if necessary. A characteristic red 
colour appears after about 10 minutes' shaking. After shaking for 4 to 6 
hours, cool the bottle to room temperature, remove it from the shaker, wire the 
stopper down and allow the mixture to stand undisturbed; sodium chloride 
and particles of mercury settle to the bottom. 

Separate the ether solution of triphenylmethyl sodium as follows. Remove

the glass stopper and replace it immediately by a tightly fitting two-holed 
bung carrying a short glass tube that protrudes about 1 cm into the bottle, 
and a long glass tube bent into an inverted U -shape. Connect the bottle 
through a drying train to a cylinder of nitrogen. Lead the other arm of the U- 
tube into a 2-litre, two-necked round-bottomed flask (which has been pre- 
viously filled with nitrogen) via a suitable screw-capped adapter and fit a 
dropping funnel into the other neck. Open the stopcock of the dropping 
funnel slightly and force the ether solution of triphenylmethyl sodium slowly 
and steadily into the nitrogen-filled flask by means of a small pressure of 
nitrogen from the cylinder. By carefully adjusting the depth of the siphon 
tube in the bottle, all but 50-75 ml of the clear ether solution may be removed. 
If pure triphenylchloromethane and freshly prepared sodium amalgam are 
used, the yield of triphenylmethyl sodium should be almost quantitative and 
the concentration is usually 0.15 mol per litre (1). The reagent should be used 
as soon as possible after its preparation. 

Ethyl 2,2,4-trimethyl-3-oxopentanoate. Add 24 g (28 ml, 0.21 mol) of ethyl 2- 
methylpropanoate b.p. 1 10-1 1 1 °C, to the solution of c. 0.21 mol of triphenyl- 
methyl sodium in approximately 1 400 ml of ether contained in the 2-litre two- 
necked flask. Stopper the flask, shake well to effect complete mixing and keep 
at room temperature for 60 hours. Acidify the reaction mixture by adding, 
with shaking, 15 ml of glacial acetic acid, and then extract with 100 ml of 
water. Wash the ethereal solution with 50 ml portions of 10 per cent sodium 
carbonate solution until free from excess acid, dry over anhydrous sodium 
sulphate; remove the ether under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. 
Distil the residue under reduced pressure through a short fractionating col- 
umn. Collect the ethyl 2,2,4-trimethyl-3-oxopentanoate at 95-96 °C/ 
18mmHg; the yield is 14.5 g (74%). The b.p. at atmospheric pressure is 201- 
202 °C. 

Note. (1) The solution may be analysed approximately as follows. Remove 25 ml of 
ether solution, run it into 25 ml of water contained in a small separatory funnel and 
shake. Run off the aqueous layer into a 250-ml conical flask and extract the ether layer 
with two 25 ml portions of water. Titrate the combined aqueous extracts with 0.95 m- 
sulphuric acid, using methyl red as indicator. 

Ketonic hydrolysis to di-isopropyl ketone. Mix 1 4 g (0.75 mol) of the ester with 
30 ml of glacial acetic acid, 10 ml of water and 10 ml of concentrated sulphuric 
acid, and boil under reflux until evolution of carbon dioxide ceases. Dilute the 
cooled solution with 180 ml of water, add 100 ml of ether and render alkaline 
to phenolphthalein with 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. Separate the 
ether layer, extract the aqueous layer with two 50 ml portions of ether, dry the 
combined ether layer and extracts with anhydrous sodium sulphate, distil off 
the ether and fractionate the residue. The yield of di-isopropyl ketone (2,4- 
dimethylpentan-3-one), b.p. 123-1 24 °C, is 6.5 g (76%).

stretch of C0 2 H) and 1730 cm" 1 (C=0). 

4-Oxodecanoic acid. Dissolve 4.0 g of 3-carboxy-3,4-dibromodecanoic acid in 
60 ml of 2m sodium hydroxide solution and heat the solution at 80-90 °C for 2 
hours. Cool to room temperature and acidify with dilute sulphuric acid; car- 
bon dioxide is evolved and a white precipitate is formed. Filter the precipi- 
tated keto acid from the cold solution and recrystallise from light petroleum 
(b.p. 40-60 °C). 4-Oxodecanoic acid, m.p. 68-69 °C, is obtained; the yield is 
1.6 g (80%). The infrared spectrum shows absorptions at 3400-2400 cm " ' 
(OH stretch of C0 2 H) and 1700 cm" 1 (C=0). 

If the dibromo acid is treated with alkali under milder conditions, for 
example with 1 m sodium hydroxide solution at 20-25 °C for 0.5 hour, the 
intermediate y-hexylaconic acid (m.p. 123-125 °C) can be isolated after acidi- 
fication. The infrared spectrum shows absorptions at 3110cm" 1 (C — H 
stretch, alkene), 1715 and 1745 cm" 1 (C=0 stretch of carboxylic acid and 
lactone) and 1630 cm (C=C stretch). 

Note. (1) Great care must be taken in the handling of potassium. See Section 4.2.62,

5.14.4 AMINO ACIDS AND PEPTIDES 

The a-aminocarboxylic acids are of particular importance as the result of their 
involvement in the primary structure of protein molecules. Although custom- 
arily represented by the general formula NH 2 -CHR-C0 2 H amino acids are 

® 
actually zwitterionic compounds, NH 3 -CHR-C0 2 , and in the solid state have 

obvious polar properties. In solution, the following pH-dependent equilibria are 

established; the pH at which the molecule has no net charge is the isoelectric 

point, characteristic for a particular amino acid.

Amino group reactions (e.g. acylation) proceed best under basic conditions, 
whereas carboxyl group reactions (e.g. esterification) are effected under acidic 
conditions with the amino function protected by protonation. 

The main general routes for the synthesis of the a-amino acids are illustrated 
in the following sections (pp. 746-750). Some of the natural amino acids can be 
isolated from the hydrolsates of suitable proteins; examples are provided on 
p. 750. They are optically active having the l [(S)] configuration. The synthetic 
products, formed by routes not involving asymmetric syntheses, are of of course 
racemic, from which the optically active forms may be obtained by the process of 
resolution. Some resolution procedures are discussed in Section 5.19. 

THE AMINATION OF a-HALOGENOCARBOXYLIC ACIDS 

This method is generally suitable for those a-amino acids [H 2 N'CH(R)-C0 2 H] 
where R is an unsubstituted alkyl group. The examples included in Expt 5.180 
are alanine (R = CH 3 ), glycine (R = H), valine (R = (CH 3 ) 2 CH), norvaline 
(R = CH 3 -CH 2 -CH 2 ), norleucine (R = CH 3 -CH 2 -CH 2 -CH 2 ) and isoleucine 
(R = CH 3 -CH 2 -CH(CH 3 )). 

Chloroacetic acid is readily converted into glycine by treatment with concen- 
trated aqueous ammonia solution, but in general an a-bromocarboxylic acid is 
preferred. This can usually be prepared in good yield by a Hell-Volhard- 
Zelinsky bromination (Section 5.14.1, p. 720) of the corresponding carboxylic 
acid; if the carboxylic acid is not readily available it can usually be obtained by 
the synthesis and bromination of the appropriate alkylmalonic acid (see Expt 
5.166).

A large excess of concentrated ammonia has to be used to accomplish the 
amination step, otherwise the amino acid which is formed reacts further with the 
bromo acid to give substantial amounts of the secondary and tertiary amine 



746 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.14 



derivatives. The use of an excess of ammonium carbonate in aqueous ammonia 
is also recommended. The reaction is usually carried out at room temperature, 
but temperatures of about 50 °C and advantageous when the substitution pro- 
cess is retarded as the result, for example, of steric effects. The higher homo- 
logous amino acids are not particularly water-soluble, and they may be isolated 
in the crude state by concentrating and filtering the reaction product. Care must 
be taken during the isolation of the readily water-soluble lower members of the 
series to free them from accompanying inorganic salts; in such cases advantage 
is taken of the solubility of ammonium bromide in methanol to achieve the 
required purification. 

THE FORMATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF a-AMINO NITRILES (the 
Strecker synthesis) 

The original Strecker procedure is the reaction of an aldehyde with ammonia 
and then with hydrogen cyanide to form the a-amino nitrile. This intermediate 
may also be obtained by reacting the aldehyde cyanohydrin with ammonia, but 
a more convenient method is to treat the aldehyde in one step with ammonium 
chloride and sodium cyanide. The a-amino acid is obtained when the amino 
nitrile is hydrolysed under either acidic or basic conditions; the former are 
usually preferred. The preparation of a-phenylglycine (R = Ph) from benzalde- 
hyde is typical of the general procedure (cognate preparation in Ept 5.181).

R-CHO — &gt; R-CH(OH)-CN 

When applied to formaldehyde, however, the reaction is somewhat anoma- 
lous in that methyleneaminoacetonitrile (CH 2 =N-CH 2 -CN), the condensation 
product derived from the aldehyde and the amino nitrile, is formed (Expt 5.181). 
The free amino nitrile is obtained by careful basification of its sulphate salt, 
which is formed when methyleneaminoacetonitrile is treated with concentrated 
sulphuric acid in ethanol. Details of the hydrolysis of the amino nitrile (as the 
sulphate) under basic conditions are given. Barium hydroxide is used, the excess 
of which is finally removed by precipitation as the sulphate to facilitate the isola- 
tion of the glycine formed. 

THE REDUCTIVE HYDROLYSIS OF ARYLIDENEOXAZOLONES 

(azlactones - the Erlenmeyer synthesis) 

This method is mainly restricted to the synthesis of amino acids with aromatic 
side-chains since the required unsaturated azlactones [e.g. (30)] are most readily 
prepared using aromatic aldehydes. Typically, benzaldehyde condenses under 
the influence of base with the reactive methylene group in the azlactone (29) 
which is formed by the dehydration of benzoylglycine (28) when the latter is 
heated with acetic anhydride in the presence of sodium acetate (cf. Expt 8.21). 
The azlactone ring is readily cleaved hydrolytically and compounds of the type 
(30) yield substituted acylaminoacrylic acids [e.g. (31)] on boiling with water. 
Reduction and further hydrolysis yields the amino acid [e.g. phenylalanine, 

747 



5.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(32)], but this result can be achieved in one step (Expt 5.182) by heating the 
azlactone (30) in acetic anhydride solution with red phosphorus and hydriodic 
acid.

THE FORMATION AND HYDROLYSIS OF C-SUBSTITUTED ACYL- 
AMINOMALONIC ESTERS 

Acylaminomalonic esters and related reagents are widely used for the synthesis 
of a-amino acids. The method differs from those syntheses already discussed in 
that the amino group is incorporated into the system from the outset. A popular 
reagent is diethyl acetamidomalonate (35). The acetamido group can readily be 
introduced into the reactive methylene position in diethyl malonate by first con- 
verting the latter into the hydroxy-imino derivative (33) by reaction with nitrous 
acid or an alkyl nitrite (cf. Section 4.2.7, p. 413). This derivative is then reduced 
catalytically to diethyl aminomalonate (34) which is acetylated using acetic 
anhydride.

(35) 



In common with other malonate derivatives, the a-hydrogen atom in the acet- 
amidomalonate is reactive; on treatment with a base the reagent forms a meso- 
merically stabilised carbanion (36) from which a variety of substituted 
acetamidomalonic esters can be made. For example, C-alkylation ensues when 
the anion is allowed to react with an alkyl halide; the resulting product (37) is 
then subjected to the hydrolytic and decarboxylative sequence shown to yield a 
simple a-amino acid.

The two examples illustrative of the section, however, involve alternative pro- 
cedures for introducing the required substituent into the a-position of the acet- 
amidomalonate reagent. In the first (Expt 5.183) the hydroxymethyl group is 
introduced by a simple base-catalysed condensation with formaldehyde; sub- 
sequent hydrolysis and decarboxylation yields serine (R = CH 2 OH). In this 
case, acidic conditions are preferred for the final hydrolytic stage, and the use of 
a weakly basic ion exchange resin to obtain the halide-free amino acid from a 
solution of its hydrochloride is described. 

The second example is an interesting synthesis of the heterocyclic amino acid 
tryptophan (R = 3-indolymethyl) which involves the initial base catalysed 1,4- 
addition (the Michael reaction, Section 5.11.6, p. 681) of diethyl acetamido- 
malonate to the oe,/?-unsaturated aldehyde, acrylaldehyde, yielding the aldehydic 
derivative (38). The derived phenylhydrazone (39) is then cyclised under acidic 
conditions (see Expt 8.26) to form the indolylacetamidomalonate derivative (40) 
which is then converted into the corresponding a-amino acid (i.e. tryptophan) in 
the usual way (Expt 5.184).

Although it does not involve the use of an acylaminomalonic ester a related 
convenient synthesis of the heterocyclic amino acid, proline, is included here 
(Expt 5.185). 

The synthesis starts with the preparation of diethyl (2-cyanoethyl)malonate 
(Expt 5.161) by the Michael addition of diethyl malonate to acrylonitrile. 
Hydrogenation over Raney nickel converts the cyanoethyl compound to the 
corresponding primary amine (41) which is converted into proline (isolated 
initially as the hydrochloride) by the reaction sequence shown. Liberation of the 
free amino acid from its salt is achieved in this case by treatment with triethyl- 
amine (cf. serine, Expt 5.183).

ISOLATION FROM PROTEIN HYDROLYSATES 

The hydrolysis of proteins yields a complex mixture of amino acids having 
closely related physical properties. Although a quantitative separation of the 
individual amino acids can be achieved by chromatographic methods, only in a 
few cases is the preparative isolation of an individual member worth while. Pro- 
vided that racemisation is avoided during hydrolysis, however, amino acids are 
obtained in this way in the optically active form. The normal synthetic products 
are of course racemic, but they may be resolved by appropriate procedures (e.g. 
the enzymic method described in Expt 5.221). 

The amino acid composition of keratin, the protein of hair and wool, includes 
a greater-than-average proportion of the sulphur-containing amino acid, cys- 
tine. Since this is the least soluble of the protein amino acids it can readily be 
isolated after carefully neutralising an acid hydrolysate of hair (Expt 5.187). Pro- 
tein hydrolysis is usually effected by boiling for about 10-20 hours with 20 per 
cent hydrochloric acid. The hydrolysis of hair for the isolation of cystine is, how- 
ever, best achieved using a mixture of hydrochloric and formic acids. 

Many relatively specific reagents, particularly a variety of metal complexes, 
have been developed as an aid to the isolation of individual amino acids. An 
example is provided by the isolation of L-proline from a gelatine hydrolysate 
using the chromium complex ammonium rhodanilate {ammonium dianiline- 

® 
tetrathiocyanatochromate (in), [Cr(CNS) 4 (C 6 H 5 NH 2 ) 2 ] e NH4. Proline is iso- 
lated as the rhodanilate salt, which is purified and then treated with pyridine to 
form the less soluble pyridine rhodanilate, thus liberating the proline into solu- 
tion. 

PEPTIDE SYNTHESIS 

In a polypeptide chain the a-amino acid residues are linked 'head to tail' by 
means of amide (peptide) bonds. 

NH 2 -CHR'-CO-NH-CHR 2 -CO-NH-CH 2 R 3 -CO-NH — CO-NH-CHR x -C0 2 H 

The formation of a dipeptide, for example, thus involves the condensation of the 
carboxyl group of one amino acid with the amino group of another. To achieve 
this apparently simple synthetic objective efficiently however, a number of reac- 
tion steps, requiring the use of appropriate functional group protection pro- 
cedures (see p. 13), must be carried out. An illustrative synthesis is that of l- 
prolylglycine described in Expt 5.188, where the sequence is formulated in full. 
Note that proline is actually a secondary rather than a primary a-amino acid, 



750 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.14 



the side chain R being linked to the nitrogen atom to form a pyrrolidine ring. 
The principal phases in the synthetic sequence are as follows. 

Functional group protection. The NH — group in proline is protected by acyla- 
tion in the usual Schotten-Baumann manner with benzyl chloroformate to yield 
the benzyloxycarbonyl derivative (42). Correspondingly the — C0 2 H group in 
glycine is protected by esterification in ethanol to form the ethyl ester, obtained 
as the hydrochloride (43) under Fischer-Speier conditions. 



Ph-CH 2 -OCON-CH-C0 2 H CI NH 3 -CH 2 -C0 2 Et 

(42) (43) 

Peptide bond formation. The process requires that the derivative (42), a carboxy- 
lic acid, should be caused to acylate the free base liberated from the hydro- 
chloride (43). Activation of the carboxyl group is effected by conversion into a 
type of acid anhydride; the mixed carbonic anhydride (44) is used here, and is 
prepared by reaction of the acid (42) with ethyl chloroformate.

The free glycine ethyl ester nucleophilically attacks the mixed anhydride 
specifically at the amino acid carbonyl, rather than the carbethoxycarbonyl 
group, liberating carbon dioxide and ethanol and forming the acylated dipep- 
tide ester in good yield. 

Deprotection. Subsequent treatment of the fully protected dipeptide illustrates, 
in an elementary way, an important aspect of functional group protection, 
namely the selective removal of specific protecting groups. Here the ester group 
is smoothly removed by hydrolysis with aqueous alkali at room temperature, 
conditions which do not affect the benzyloxycarbonyl group. The latter can 
readily be cleaved by catalytic hydrogenolysis without affecting the ethyl ester 
group. Performance of these two procedures sequentially affords the required 
dipeptide. The intermediate mono-protected derivatives can of course be used in 
similar synthetic sequences for the construction of longer peptide chains. 

Experiment 5.180 dl-ALANINE (2-Aminopropanoic acid) 

Me-CHBr-C0 2 H -^&gt; Me-CH(NH 2 )-C0 2 H 

Place 2 litres (1760 g, 36 mol) of concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.88, 35% 
w/w) (1) in a large (e.g. Winchester) bottle, cool thoroughly in an ice bath and 
pour in slowly 77 g (0.5 mol) of 2-bromopropanoic acid (Expt 5.164). Close 
the bottle with a rubber bung held in place with wire, and leave at room tem- 
perature for 4 days. Concentrate the solution to about 250 ml by distillation 
under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator; apply the vacuum with 
caution in the initial stages when most of the excess of ammonia is being 
removed. Filter, concentrate further to 150 ml, cool in ice and add 750 ml of 

751 



5.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



methanol with swirling. Leave the resulting suspension overnight in a refri- 
gerator, and then filter off the crude alanine with suction and wash it with 
200 ml of methanol. Dissolve the product in 150 ml of water, reprecipitate the 
alanine by adding 750 ml of methanol and filter and wash as before. The yield 
of almost pure DL-alanine, m.p. 295-296 °C (decomp.), is 30 g (67%). 

Note. (1) Alternatively use 225 g of 'ammonium carbonate', 175 ml of water and 
250 ml (4.5 mol) of concentrated ammonia solution. 'Ammonium carbonate' is a mix- 
ture of roughly equimolar amounts of ammonium hydrogen carbonate and ammo- 
nium carbamate (NH 4 HC0 3 -NH 2 C0 2 NH 4 ). 

Cognate preparations. Glycine (aminoacetic acid). Use 47 g (0.5 mol) of 
chloroacetic acid (CAUTION: the compound causes blistering if it is allowed 
to come into contact with the skin) and 2 litres of concentrated ammonia solu- 
tion. Allow the reaction to proceed for 2 days, concentrate to 60 ml and pre- 
cipitate the crude glycine by adding 360 ml of methanol. This material 
contains ammonium chloride as the chief impurity; remove most of this by 
stirring the crystals with 150 ml of methanol and refiltering. Finally purify the 
glycine by dissolving it in 50 ml of hot water and adding 250 ml of methanol; 
the yield is 25 g (67%), m.p. c. 252-254 °C (decomp.). 

DL-Valine {2-amino-3-methylbutanoic acid). Use 60 g (0.33 mol) of 2-bromo- 
3-methylbutanoic (Expt 5.164) and 400 ml (7.25 mol) of concentrated ammo- 
nia solution. Allow reaction to proceed at room temperature for 7 days. Con- 
centrate the solution to 50 ml and filter the resulting thin paste. Dissolve the 
solid in 1 50 ml of hot water, decolourise with 1 g of charcoal, filter hot and 
dilute the filtrate with 150 ml of ethanol. Cool at 0°C overnight, filter off the 
purified DL-valine and wash with 10 ml of cold ethanol. The yield is 12.5 g 
(32%); m.p. 280-282 °C (decomp.). A further 2g may be isolated by concen- 
trating the mother-liquor to about 25 ml and adding an equal volume of etha- 
nol. 

DL-Norvaline (2-aminopentanoic acid). Prepare as for valine, using 2-bromo- 
pentanoic acid (Expt 5.164); m.p. c. 300 °C (decomp.). 

DL-Norleucine (2-aminohexanoic acid). Use 65 g (0.33 mol) of 2-bromo- 
hexanoic acid (Expt 5.164) and 400 ml of concentrated ammonia. Ensure that 
the bung is securely wired to the reaction bottle and allow the latter to stand 
in a warm place (50-55 °C) for 30 hours. Filter the amino acid at the pump 
and keep the filtrate (A) separately. Wash the amino acid well with methanol 
to remove the ammonium bromide present. Concentrate the filtrate (A) 
almost to dryness and add 150 ml of methanol. A second crop of amino acid 
contaminated with ammonium bromide is thus obtained; wash it with metha- 
nol and recrystallise from hot water, thus affording a further 6 g of pure dl- 
norleucine. The total yield is 28 g -(65%); the decomposition point is about 
325 °C. 

DL-holeucine (2-amino-3-methylpentanoic acid). Allow 65 g (0.33 mol) of 2- 
bromo-3-methylpentanoic acid (Expt 5.166) to react with 400 ml of concen- 
trated ammonia solution as for valine. Concentrate the resulting solution to 
about 130 ml, filter off a first crop of crude product and wash with 20 ml of 
ethanol. Further concentrate the aqueous filtrate to about 60 ml to obtain a 
second crop of crude product, and wash it with 10 ml of water followed by 



752 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.14 



10 ml of ethanol. Dissolve the combined product (28 g) in 400 ml of hot water, 
decolourise with charcoal and add 200 ml of rectified spirit. Cool well in ice, 
and filter off the pure DL-isoleucine; yield 16.5 g (38%), m.p. 278-280 °C 
(decomp.). A further 5 g may be recovered by concentrating the recrystallisa- 
tion mother-liquor to 40 ml and diluting with an equal volume of ethanol.

A-Methyleneaminoacetonitrile. Place 160g (3 mol) of ammonium chloride in 
a 2-litre flange or three-necked flask surrounded by a large bath containing a 
cooling mixture of ice and salt (fume cupboard). Add 450 ml (6 mol) of filtered 
40 per cent w/v formaldehyde solution and stir the mixture with an efficient 
mechanical stirrer. When the temperature has reached °C, begin the drop- 
wise addition of a solution of 150g (3 mol) of sodium cyanide (98% pure) 
(CAUTION) in 250 ml of water; the addition should take about 5 hours and 
the temperature throughout should be kept between and 5 °C. When half of 
the cyanide solution has been added and all of the ammonium chloride has 
dissolved begin the simultaneous gradual addition of 100 ml of glacial acetic 
acid, and adjust the rate so that addition is complete by the end of the remain- 
ing 2.5 hours. Stir the mixture for a further period of 1 hour, and then filter off 
the product and wash it with a little cold water. Transfer the filter-cake to a 
beaker, stir thoroughly with 500 ml of water to remove soluble salts, filter, 
wash with a little more water and dry in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of N- 
methyleneaminoacetonitrile (1) is 120g (59%), m.p. 127-128 °C. 

Aminoacetonitrile sulphate. Cautiously add 85 ml of concentrated sulphuric 
acid to 400 ml of rectified spirit in a 1 -litre conical flask and adjust the tem- 
perature to 50 °C. Add rapidly 102 g (1.5 mol) of dried powdered JV-methyl- 
eneaminoacetonitrile, shake vigorously until the solid has dissolved and 
continue shaking while the product crystallises. Cool in an ice bath for 4 
hours, filter and wash the product with a little cold rectified spirit. Dissolve 
the crude product in a minimum of water, filter off traces of insoluble matter 
and run the solution with stirring into 400 ml of cold rectified spirit. Cool 
well, filter off the purified aminonitrile salt and wash it with a little cold recti- 
fied spirit. The yield is 105 g (67%), m.p. 164 °C (decomp.). 

Hydrolysis to glycine. Boil a suspension of 79 g (0.25 mol) of barium hydrox- 
ide octahydrate in 175 ml of water in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask and add 
in portions 21 g (0.1 mol) of aminoacetonitrile sulphate. Fit a reflux con- 
denser and continue boiling until no more ammonia is evolved (about 3 
hours). Transfer the suspension to a beaker, add 50 per cent v/v aqueous sul- 
phuric acid (about 20 ml) until precipitation of the barium is complete and 
the solution is slightly acidic, and digest on a steam bath. Filter the suspen- 
sion through a medium-speed filter paper (e.g. Whatman No. 30) using gentle 

753 



5.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



suction, and adjust the filtrate to neutrality by carefully adding saturated 
barium hydroxide solution. Digest further and decant the supernatant solu- 
tion through a similar filter paper (this is best done under gravity), suspend 
the precipitate in a little hot water and add this to the filter. Concentrate the 
filtrate under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator until a thick suspen- 
sion is obtained, and complete the precipitation of the glycine by adding 
100 ml of methanol. Cool well and filter off the crude glycine (about 12g). 
Dissolve the product in 25 ml of hot water, add gradually 1 25 ml of methanol, 
cool, filter and dry the crystals in an oven at 50 °C. The yield of glycine, m.p. c. 
250 °C (decomp.), is 11.2 g (75%). 

Aminoacetonitrile. Stir a suspension of 88 g (0.4 mol) of the nitrile sulphate in 
100 ml of dry methanol in a 500-ml three-necked flask cooled in crushed ice. 
Add a few crystals of phenolphthalein as an indicator, pass a slow stream of 
nitrogen through the flask and run in during 1 hour a solution of sodium 
methoxide in methanol prepared from 17 g (0.75 mol) of sodium and 350 ml 
of dry methanol; the suspension should at no time be allowed to become per- 
manently alkaline to phenolphthalein. Filter, and remove the methanol and 
distil the residue under reduced pressure under nitrogen. The yield of amino- 
acetonitrile, b.p. 73.5°C/15mmHg, is 35 g (83% based on sodium). Store the 
product at 0°C under nitrogen. 

Note. (1) The product in fact has a trimeric structure. 

Cognate preparation. DL-2-Aminophenylaeetic acid (a-phenylglycine). Dis- 
solve 10 g (0.2 mol) of sodium cyanide in 40 ml of water, add 1 1 g (0.2 mol) of 
ammonium chloride and shake until dissolved. Add a solution of 21 g 
(0.2 mol) of redistilled benzaldehyde in 40 ml of methanol and shake vigor- 
ously. The mixture soon becomes warm; allow it to stand at ambient 
temperature for 2 hours, shaking occasionally. Then add 100 ml of water and 
shake well, and extract out the oily aminonitrile which separates using two 
portions (60 ml and 40 ml) of toluene. Combine the toluene layers, wash twice 
with water and extract with two 60 ml portions of 5 m hydrochloric acid. Boil 
the acid extract under reflux for 22 hours (CARE: hydrogen cyanide is 
evolved). Cool and filter through a small plug of cotton wool to remove a little 
tarry matter. Basify the solution by adding about 40 ml of concentrated 
ammonia solution (dO.88) with stirring and cooling, collect the resulting pre- 
cipitate by filtration and wash it with 100 ml of cold water and then with 
1 5 ml of warm ethanol. The crude material is almost colourless; the yield is 
1 1 .5 g after drying in an oven at 50 °C. To purify the phenylglycine, dissolve it 
in 80 ml of 1 m sodium hydroxide, add 50 ml of ethanol and clarify the solu- 
tion by adding a little decolourising charcoal, warming and filtering. Heat the 
filtrate almost to boiling and neutralise by slowly adding with stirring 16 ml 
of 5 m hydrochloric acid. Filter off the purified DL-phenylglycine, wash it with 
10 ml of ethanol followed by 20 ml of water and dry at 50 °C; the yield of 
colourless glistening plates is 9g (30%). The compound has no m.p.; when 
placed in a rapidly heated melting point apparatus when the temperature 
reaches 275 °C, it sublimes between 300 and 310 °C, depending upon the rate 
of heating.

evaporate the solution to a syrup under reduced pressure on a rotary evapor- 
ator. Dissolve the syrup in 120 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, boil 
under reflux (fume cupboard) for 1 hour and evaporate to dryness under 
reduced pressure. Extract the dry residue with 200 ml of boiling absolute 
ethanol, filter off the sodium chloride and extract the latter with a further 
100-ml portion of hot ethanol. Evaporate the ethanol extracts on the rotary 
evaporator and boil the residue under reflux with 100 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid for 1 hour (fume cupboard). Evaporate again to a syrup, 
and dissolve the latter in water and re-evaporate twice more to remove most 
of the excess hydrochloric acid. Finally dissolve the residual gum in about 
200 ml of distilled water and pass the solution through a 50 x 2.75 cm col- 
umn of a weakly basic anion exchange resin (e.g. Amberite IR 45, e OH form, 
about 300 ml of moist granules). Continue to elute the column with distilled 
water (about 1.5 litres) until the eluate gives no purple coloration when a 
portion is tested by boiling with a few mg of ninhydrin (2). Combine all the 
ninhydrin-positive eluates, which should be free from chloride ion, and evap- 
orate to dryness under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator). Dissolve the 
straw-coloured residue in 150 ml of hot water, boil with a little decolourising 
charcoal, filter and add to the filtrate 750 ml of hot ethanol. Cool in ice, filter 
off the purified DL-serine which crystallises, wash it with a little cold ethanol 
and dry in an oven at 50 °C. The yield is 12g(57%), m.p. c. 235 °C (decomp.). 
The product thus obtained is homogeneous (R F 0.57) on t.l.c. (silica gel, 15 cm 
run; butan-1-ol-formic acid-water, 6:3:1) (3). 

Notes. (1) If necessary, the formaldehyde solution should be neutralised (narrow 
range pH paper) by the careful dropwise addition of 1 m sodium hydroxide solution. 

(2) After use, regenerate the resin in the following way. Firstly exhaust the column by 
passing 0.25 m hydrochloric acid through it until the pH of the eluate is about 2. Wash 
the column with 2 or 3 bed-volumes if distilled water, and then regenerate the resin by 
passing through it 0.25 m sodium hydroxide solution until the eluate is strongly alka- 
line. Finally wash the column thoroughly with much distilled water until the pH of the 
eluate is within the range 5.5-6.5 (narrow range indicator paper). 

(3) Using this solvent system, serine is not completely separable from glycine (R F 0.58) 
which is a possible contaminant. The latter may be distinguished, however, by the 
characteristic brownish-pink spot which it gives on spraying with ninhydrin; that of 
serine is purple.

Phenylhydrazone of 4-acetamido-4,4-diethoxycarbonylbutanal. CAUTION: 

Carry out all operations in an efficient fume cupboard. Place 43.5 g (0.2 mol) of 
diethyl acetamidomalonate and 70 ml of benzene (CAUTION) in a 250-ml 
three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer and dropping funnel and surrounded 
by a bath of water at room temperature. Stir mechanically, add about 0.5 ml 
of a concentrated solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol and then add slowly 
from the dropping funnel a solution of 12g (14ml, 0.215 mol) of acrylalde- 
hyde [acrolein - CAUTION: highly toxic and irritant vapour (1)] in 14 ml of 
benzene; adjust the rate of addition so that the temperature of the reaction 
mixture does not exceed 35 °C. When the addition is complete, stir for 2 hours 
more and filter off any traces of insoluble material. Add 5 ml of glacial acetic 
acid and 24 g (22 ml, 0.22 mol) of redistilled phenylhydrazine [CAUTION: 
(2)], warm to 50 °C and leave the resulting orange solution at room tempera- 
ture for 2 days. Collect the crystalline phenylhydrazone by filtration and 
wash it thoroughly by trituration with two 40 ml portions of benzene. The 
yield of off-white crystals, m.p. 141 °C, is 50 g (69%). If the yield is low, warm 
the filtrate to 50 °C and set it aside for a further 2 days, when a further crop of 
the product may be obtained. 

Diethyl (3-indolylmethyi)acetamidomalonate. Add 47 g (0.13 mol) of the 
phenylhydrazone to 300 ml of water containing 14 ml of concentrated sul- 
phuric acid in a 500-ml two-necked flask fitted with a sealed stirrer unit and a 
reflux condenser. Boil the mixture under reflux with vigorous stirring for 4.5 
hours; the suspended solid liquefies and then solidifies during this time. Cool, 
filter off the resulting product (in the form of hard nodules) and wash it thor- 
oughly by grinding it with water and re-filtering. Recrystallise the product 
from 1:1 aqueous ethanol to obtain the purified malonate derivative; yield 
32 g (71%). The product melts at 143 °C, re-solidifies and then melts at 1 59 °C. 

DL-Tryptophan. Boil 31 g (0.09 mol) of the above product under reflux for 4 
hours with a solution of 18 g (0.45 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 180 ml of 
water. Add a little decolourising charcoal, filter and cool the filtrate in an ice- 
salt bath. Acidify the filtrate by adding about 55 ml of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid slowly and with shaking, keeping the temperature below 20 °C. 
Cool the resulting suspension at 0°C for 4 hours and then collect the crude 
(indolylmethyl)malonic acid, a pale buff solid, by filtration. Boil the crude 
product under reflux with 1 30 ml of water for 3 hours; decarboxylation ensues 
and some JV-acetyltryptophan separates. Add a solution of 16 g (0.4 mol) of 
sodium hydroxide in 30 ml of water, continue to boil under reflux for 20 
hours and then add about 1 g of decolourising charcoal and filter. Cool, 
acidify the filtrate by adding 24 g (23 ml, 0.4 mol) of glacial acetic acid and 
cool the mixture at °C for 5 hours. Collect the crude tryptophan by filtra- 
tion, dissolve it in a solution of 5 g of sodium hydroxide in 200 ml of water 
and warm to 70 °C. Dilute the solution with 100 ml of ethanol at 70 °C and 
decant it from a little gummy precipitate which separates. Acidify the hot 
solution with 7.5 ml of glacial acetic acid and allow to cool slowly. When crys- 
tallisation is complete, filter off the purified DL-tryptophan and wash it suc- 
cessively with ice-cold water (2 x 40 ml), ethanol (2 x 40 ml) and ether (2 x 
40 ml). The yield of colourless plates is 15 g (82%), m.p. 283-284 °C 
(decomp.). The i.r. spectrum of the L-enantiomer is shown in Fig. 3.37.

Notes. (1) Acrolein is usually supplied in sealed amber-coloured ampoules stabilised 
by the addition of a little hydroquinone. The ampoule should be cooled thoroughly 
before being opened with great care. It has been recorded that opened samples of 
acrolein stored in screw-capped bottles may explode violently, presumably as the re- 
sult of rapid exothermic polymerisation. 

(2) Phenylhydrazine is highly poisonous and produces unpleasant burns in contact 
with the skin. Always wear disposable gloves. If any liquid does come in contact with 
the skin wash off immediately with 2 per cent acetic acid, then with soap and water.

3-Ethoxycarbonyl-2-piperidone. Dissolve 160g (0.75 mol) of diethyl (2- 
cyanoethyl)malonate (Expt 5.161) in 600 ml of ethanol and hydrogenate in 
the presence of about 4-5 g of Raney nickel catalyst (Section 4.2.50, p. 450) at 
80 °C and 75 atmospheres pressure of hydrogen in an autoclave (Section 
2.17.1); uptake of hydrogen is complete in about 2 hours. Remove the catalyst 
by filtration and the solvent by distillation under reduced pressure (rotary 
evaporator) and pour the residue with stirring into 500 ml of light petroleum 
(b.p. 60-80 °C). Filter off the precipitated piperidone and allow it to dry in the 
air; yield 1 1 5 g (90%), m.p. 74 °C. A specimen crystallised from ethanol/light 
petroleum has m.p. 80 °C. 

3-ChIoro-3-ethoxycarbonyI-2-piperidone. Assemble in a fume cupboard a 
500-ml three-necked flask fitted with a sealed stirrer unit, a dropping funnel 
and a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride guard-tube. Charge 
the flask with a solution of 1 1 1 g (0.65 mol) of 3-ethoxycarbonyl-2-piperidone 
in 175 ml of dry chloroform (CAUTION), and the dropping funnel with 90 g 
(54 ml, 0.67 mol) of redistilled sulphuryl chloride dissolved in 125 ml of dry 
chloroform; close the neck of the funnel with a calcium chloride guard-tube. 
Start the stirrer, and slowly run in the solution of sulphuryl chloride so that 
the reaction mixture refluxes gently. When the addition is complete, warm on 
a steam bath until hydrogen chloride .evolution ceases. Remove the solvent 
under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and cool the residue, 
scratching the sides of the flask to induce crystallisation. Dissolve the solid in 
70 ml of hot ethyl acetate, add hot light petroleum (b.p. 80-100 °C) until the 
solution is slightly turbid, and cool while scratching the side of the vessel 
vigorously until the product crystallises (it helps to add a few crystals of the 
crude solid as a seed). Add 30 ml more of light petroleum, cool further and 
filter. The chloropiperidone is obtained as a somewhat sticky white solid, 
m.p. 64-68 °C; yield is 100 g (82%).

DL-Proline hydrochloride. Boil 103 g (0.5 mol) of the above chloropiperidone 
under reflux with 200 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid (fume cupboard) 
for 5 hours during which time decarboxylation ensues. Boil the solution with 
about 2 g of decolourising charcoal (acid-washed grade), filter and evaporate 
under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator; dissolve the residue in 
water and re-evaporate to assist the removal of most of the excess hydro- 
chloric acid. Dissolve the resulting pale golden syrup in 80 ml of water, add a 
solution of 60 g of sodium hydroxide in 120 ml of water and leave at room 
temperature for 2 days. Acidify the solution to Congo red paper with concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid (about 130 ml are needed) and evaporate to dryness 
under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator). Dry the resulting solid com- 
pletely by leaving it overnight in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pen- 
toxide and potassium hydroxide pellets, and then extract it with 200 ml of 
boiling absolute ethanol. Filter off the sodium chloride and re-extract it with 
150 ml more of boiling ethanol. Evaporate the ethanol from the combined fil- 
trates and boil the residue under reflux for 1 hour with 1.25 litres of 2 m 
hydrochloric acid to hydrolyse any proline ester formed in the extraction pro- 
cess. Evaporate to dryness, redissolve the residue in water and re-evaporate, 
and dry the resulting crude DL-proline hydrochloride in a vacuum desiccator 
over phosphorus pentoxide and potassium hydroxide; the yield is 70 g. 
Recrystallise the product from 175 ml of hot propan-2-ol, cool in ice, filter 
and wash the crystals with 20 ml of ice-cold propan-2-ol. The yield of the pur- 
ified product, m.p. 148-150 °C, is 50 g (66%). 

Conversion to DL-proline. Suspend 15 g (0.1 mol) of dry proline hydrochloride 
in 70 ml of dry chloroform, stir vigorously and run in dropwise 1 5 g (0. 1 5 mol) 
of dried, redistilled triethylamine. Continue stirring for 1 hour, filter off the 
product and wash it with a little cold chloroform. The yield of DL-proline is 
10 g (87%); a sample crystallised from absolute ethanol has m.p. 206-207 °C 
(with preliminary sintering).

methanol, 125 ml of ammonia solution and 1250 ml of water in the above 
manner. Dry the resulting ammonium rhodanilate sesquihydrate in an oven 
at 50 °C; the yield is 130 g (50.5%). 

L-Proline. Place 150g of good quality sheet gelatin (cut into conveniently 
sized pieces) in a 1 -litre flask and add 450 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid. Boil gently under reflux for 8 hours (fume cupboard), or boil under reflux 
for about 3 hours and leave on a steam bath overnight; complete hydrolysis is 
indicated by a negative biuret reaction (1). Concentrate the hydrolysate to a 
syrup by distillation under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator), and remove 
excess hydrochloric acid by dissolving the syrup in water and evaporating 
twice more. Dissolve the residual syrup finally in 500 ml of water, boil briefly 
with 3g of decolourising charcoal, filter, cool and dilute with water to 
1 200 ml. Add this solution slowly with stirring to a filtered solution of 1 25 g of 
ammonium rhodanilate in 750 ml of methanol and keep at °C for 2 hours to 
allow the complete separation of proline rhodanilate. Filter off the latter, 
wash it with water and suck as dry as possible. Dissolve the damp crude 
product in 400 ml of methanol, filter and add 800 ml of 0.5 m hydrochloric 
acid slowly with stirring. Cool at °C for 2 hours, filter off the purified proline 
rhodanilate and wash it with 250 ml of cold water. Dry the product in an oven 
at 50 °C; the yield is about 100 g, m.p. c. 130°C, with preliminary softening 
and blackening. 

Suspend the purified salt in 850 ml of water in a stoppered bottle, add 
25 ml of pure pyridine and shake the mixture for 4-5 hours. Remove the in- 
soluble pyridine rhodanilate by filtration and wash it with 100 ml of cold 
water (2). Combine the pale pink filtrate and washings, and add glacial acetic 
acid dropwise until the formation of a small pink precipitate is complete. 
Filter, evaporate the almost colourless filtrate to dryness (rotary evaporator) 
and suspend the residue in absolute ethanol and re-evaporate twice. Dry the 
resulting faintly pink crude proline in a vacuum desiccator over silica gel; the 
yield is about 18 g. Recrystallise from the minimum volume of absolute 
ethanol to obtain 1 1 g (7.3% based on gelatin) of L-proline, m.p. 218-219 °C 
(decomp.), [a]^ 8 -85.6° (c3.0 in H 2 0). Check the purity of the product by 
t.l.c. on silica gel using the solvent system butan-1-ol-acetic acid- water, 4:1:1; 
R F 0.26 (yellow spot with ninhydrin). 

Notes. (1) Remove about 0.25 ml of the hydrolysate, cool it and basify it with 5 m 
sodium hydroxide solution. To a portion add a few drops of very dilute copper(u) sul- 
phate solution, and note the absence of any colour change. As a control, prepare a 
specimen of biuret (NHyCONH-CONH 2 ) by heating about lOmg of urea just 
above its melting point for about 2 minutes. Add a little basified hydrolysate warm to 
dissolve, cool and add a trace of copper(u) sulphate. A deep pink colour superimposed 
upon the pale brown colour of the hydrolysate should be observed. If the hydrolysate 
gives a similar colour originally, it contains peptide material and hydrolysis should be 
continued until the biuret test is negative. 

(2) About 100 g of pyridine rhodanilate is obtained. To convert this into the ammo- 
nium salt for re- use, suspend it in 175 ml of methanol and add 90 ml of concentrated 
ammonia solution. Stir at °C for 30 minutes and then dilute gradually with 900 ml of 
water. Filter off the precipitated ammonium salt, wash it with water and repeat the

Place 500 g of washed, dried human hair (1) in a 3-litre round-bottomed flask 
and add 1 litre of a 1:1 mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and formic 
acid. Fit a reflux condenser and boil the mixture gently under reflux (fume 
cupboard) until the biuret test [Expt 5.186, Note (1)] is negative (about 20 
hours). Treat the hydrolysate with about 12 g of acid-washed decolourising 
charcoal, filter hot and concentrate the filtrate to a thick syrup under reduced 
pressure using a rotary evaporator. Dissolve the residue in 250 ml of water 
and add with shaking warm 50 per cent aqueous sodium acetate until the 
solution is no longer acid to Congo red. Leave the mixture at room temperat- 
ure for 3 days, and then filter off the precipitate of crude cystine and wash it 
with 50 ml of warm water. Dissolve the product in 750 ml of 1m hydrochloric 
acid, treat the hot solution with 5 g of acid-washed decolourising charcoal 
and filter. If the filtrate is more than faintly yellow, repeat the treatment with 
a further 5 g of charcoal. Neutralise the filtrate to Congo red and with sodium 
acetate solution as previously and leave at room temperature for 5-6 hours 
(2). Filter off the colourless plates of purified L-cystine, wash with two 50 ml 
portions of hot water, then with ethanol and finally with ether. The yield is 
about 25 g (5%); m.p. 260-262 °C (decomp.); [&lt;x]£, -21 6° (c 0.69 in 1 m HC1). 

Notes. (1) Raw material can usually be obtained from barbers' shops. The washing 
procedure must remove effectively grease and natural oils. A warm aqueous solution 
of a good quality detergent is satisfactory; it is important that the washing medium 
should not be alkaline as this may markedly reduce the yield of cystine. Raw sheep's 
wool, adequately cleaned, may also be used as the starting material if available, but 
processed material (e.g. old woollen garments, etc.) may give poor yields. 
(2) The crude product contains some of the aromatic amino acid tyrosine which is 
present in the original hydrolysate. A portion of this is removed by the charcoal treat- 
ment and by the hot-water washing, but the final recrystallised cystine may be contam- 
inated with tyrosine if the suggested 5-6 hour period for crystallisation is greatly 
exceeded.

of absolute ethanol with the aid of about lOg of dry hydrogen chloride in the 
manner described for the preparation of glycylglycine ethyl ester hydro- 
chloride (Expt 8.38). Recrystallise the product from the minimum of absolute 
ethanol. The yield of glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride, m.p. 144 °C, is 18.5 g 
(66%). 

Benzyloxycarbonyl-L-proline. Dissolve 4.6 g (0.04 mol) of L-proline (Expt 
5. 1 86) in 10 ml (0.04 mol) of 4 m sodium hydroxide solution, cool to °C in an 
ice bath, and add 7.0 g (0.041 mol) of benzyl chloroformate and 10 ml 
(0.04 mol) of 4 m sodium hydroxide solution alternately and portionwise, 
with shaking and cooling, during 30 minutes. Allow the mixture to warm to 
room temperature with intermittent shaking during 1 hour, extract with 2 x 
1 5-ml portions of ether, and acidify the aqueous phase (Congo red) with 
dilute (1:1) hydrochloric acid. Extract the liberated oil with 4 x 10-ml por- 
tions of ether, dry over anhydrous sodium sulphate, and remove the ether to 
obtain 8.8 g (88%) of benzyloxycarbonyl-L-proline which crystallises slowly. 
A sample recrystallised from ether-light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C) has m.p. 
75 °C. 

Benzyloxycarbonyl-L-proIyglycine. Dissolve 6.2 g (25 mmol) of benzyloxy- 
carbonyl-L-proline in 15 ml of dry chloroform containing 2.5 g (3.4 ml, 
25 mmol) of dried redistilled triethylamine and cool the mixture in ice while 
adding 2.7 g (2.4 ml, 25 mmol) of ethyl chloroformate steadily and with shak- 
ing. Set the mixture aside at 0°C for 15 minutes and then stir into the semi- 
solid mass a suspension of 3.5 g (25 mmol) of glycine ester hydrochloride in 
20 ml of dry chloroform containing a further 2.5 g of dry triethylamine. 
Carbon dioxide is evolved and the solids go into solution. Set the mixture 
aside at room temperature for 30 minutes, warm at 50 °C for 10 minutes, and 
then wash it successively with 15 ml of water, 10 ml of 1 m hydrochloric acid, 
2 x 10-ml portions of 0.5 m sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 10 ml 
of water. Dry the solution over anhydrous sodium sulphate and remove the 
chloroform under reduced pressure to obtain 8.3 g (99%) of benzyloxy- 
carbonyl-L-prolylglycine ethyl ester as an oil. Dissolve the entire product in a 
mixture of 26 ml of 1 m sodium hydroxide solution and 10 ml of acetone and 
set it aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Concentrate the solution some- 
what under reduced pressure to remove most of the acetone and then acidify 
(Congo red) with dilute (1:1) hydrochloric acid. Extract the precipitated oil

with ethyl acetate, dry over anhydrous sodium sulphate and remove the sol- 
vent under reduced pressure. The resulting oil crystallises slowly on cooling 
and scratching under a small quantity of ethyl acetate. To recrystallise dis- 
solve the product in the minimum of hot ethyl acetate, cool somewhat and 
add an equal volume of ether, and then seed and set aside overnight. The yield 
of benzyloxycarbonyl-L-prolyglycine, m.p. 122-123 °C, is 5.3 g (69%). A 
sample crystallised from water has m.p. 125 °C. 

L-Prolyglycine. Dissolve 4.6 g (1 5 mmol) of the foregoing product in 75 ml of 
methanol and add 75 ml of water and 2 ml of glacial acetic acid. Place 0.4 g of 
palladium black (Section 4.2.54, p. 453) into a Drechsel bottle and add the 
above solution, taking care to rinse all traces of catalyst down below the sur- 
face of the liquid. Connect the Drechsel bottle inlet tube to a hydrogen 
cylinder and vent the exit tube to the external atmosphere or to a fume cup- 
board via a second Drechsel bottle charged with lime-water. Suspend the 
bottom of the inlet tube just above the surface of the liquid in the reaction 
bottle and pass in hydrogen to displace the air. Lower the Drechsel head to 
close the system and allow hydrogen to bubble through the reaction mixture 
at a rate sufficient to agitate the catalyst. Continue the passage of hydrogen 
for about 2 hours, shaking periodically. The onset of the reaction, accom- 
panied by the liberation of carbon dioxide, is indicated by typical carbonate 
precipitation in the lime-water bubbler; continue to pass hydrogen until car- 
bon dioxide evolution ceases (confirm using a fresh charge of lime-water). 
Then filter off the catalyst (CARE - pyrophoric when dry) and evaporate the 
solution to dryness under reduced pressure. Recrystallise the residue by dis- 
solving it in the minimum of hot water, adding hot methanol and cooling. 
L-Prolylglycine is obtained as the monohydrate; yield 2.4 g (86%), m.p. 
226-227 °C (decomp.), [oeU 7 -21.9° (c 3.9 in H 2 0). Check the homogeneity 
of the product by t.l.c. on silica gel using the system butan-1-ol-ethanol- 
acetic acid-water, 9:3:2:4; R F 0.14. 



5.15 NITROALKANES 

Primary (R-CH 2 -N0 2 ), and also secondary (R 2 CH-N0 2 ), nitroalkanes exist in 
tautomeric equilibrium with the corresponding nitronic acids, the two species 
being interconvertible via the mesomerically stabilised a-carbanion. These 
nitroalkanes are therefore soluble in alkali.

Tertiary nitroalkanes (R 3 ON0 2 ) are neutral. The most important unsaturated 
analogues are the vinyl nitro compounds (e.g. R-CH=CH-N0 2 ). All these nitro 
compounds have in recent years become of great interest as versatile inter- 
mediates in organic synthesis. 196 Some of these aspects are noted in Chapter 1, 
p. 21, in Section 5.7.7, p. 599, and in Section 5.9.3, p. 635, and are further exem- 
plified in the following discussion.

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The characteristic i.r. frequency for the nitro group is observed as twin absorp- 
tions which occur in the region of 1560 and 1388 cm" 1 and are attributed to the 
asymmetric and symmetric stretching of the nitrogen-oxygen bonds respect- 
ively. The nitro group, being strongly electron withdrawing, causes the a- 
protons in the alkyl group to be deshielded, and hence the signals occur in the 
5 4.4 region of the p.m.r spectrum (see Appendix 3). The structure of the alkyl 
group may be inferred from the spin-spin coupling patterns (cf. p. 341). Further 
illustrative and descriptive spectroscopic interpretations are given in some of the 
preparations below. 

5.15.1 THE DISPLACEMENT OF A HALOGEN BY A NITRITE ION IN AN ALKYL HALIDE 

Classically, primary nitroalkanes may be prepared by heating the alkyl bromide 
(or iodide) but not the chloride, with silver nitrite, frequently in anhydrous ether. 
The method is not satisfactory with secondary or tertiary halides, when the 
major products are the alkyl nitrites. 

764 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.15 



0=N-&gt;O^R-Br &gt; R-NO, + Br e 

This method is clearly expensive, and nowadays the cheaper sodium nitrite is 
employed with the alkyl halide in dimethyl sulphoxide or dimethylformamide as 
solvent. 197 Although the yields are a little lower than in the silver nitrite method, 
a further feature is that secondary halides may be converted into secondary 
nitroalkanes, although even this modification fails with tertiary halides. The 
reaction is illustrated by the preparation of 2-nitrooctane (Expt 5.189). 

This method offers therefore a means of preparation of primary and second- 
ary nitroalkanes which then provides a facile route to primary amines (by reduc- 
tion, Section 5.16.2, p. 774), aldehydes and ketones (the Nef reaction, Sections 
5.7.7, p. 599, and 5.8.7, p. 623), and to the rapidly developing strategy of carbon- 
carbon bond construction by way of the mesomerically stabilised anions 
(Section 5.15.3, p. 768). 

Experiment 5.189 2-NITROOCTANE 197

CAUTION: Nitroalkanes should always be distilled in apparatus sited behind a 
safety screen. 

2-Iodooctane (71.2 g, 0.30 ml) is poured into a stirred solution of 225 ml of 
dimethyl sulphoxide and 36 g of sodium nitrite (0.52 mol) contained in a 500- 
ml flask immersed in a water bath held at room temperature. Stirring is con- 
tinued for 4 hours. The reaction mixture is poured into 600 ml of ice-water 
layered over with light petroleum (b.p. 35-37 °C). After separation the 
aqueous phase is further extracted with four 100-ml portions of light petro- 
leum. The combined organic extracts are washed with four 100-ml portions 
of water and dried over magnesium sulphate. The drying agent is removed by 
filtration and the light petroleum solution is distilled through a small frac- 
tionating column at atmospheric pressure, after which the residue is distilled 
under reduced pressure. The following fractions are obtained: (i) 14.0 g (30%) 
of 2-octyl nitrite, b.p. 32°C/2mmHg, ng 1 1.4089; (ii) 3.9 g, b.p. 53-56 °C/ 
ImmHg, n^ 1 1.4111-1.4382; and (iii) 27 g (58%), b.p. 61 °C/1 mmHg of 2- 
nitrooctane, n^' 1.4281. 

Cognate preparation. Nitrocyclopentane. Use cyclopentyl bromide (22.0 g, 
0.15mol), sodium nitrite (18g, 0.26mol) and 100ml of dimethyl sulphoxide; 
allow the reaction mixture to stir at 15°C for 3 hours. The product (9.9 g, 
58%), b.p. 62°C/8mmHg, n^ 1 1.4538, was isolated as above. 

5.15.2 THE OXIDATION OF OXIIHES AND AMINES 

The oxidation of oximes offers an attractively simple route to nitroalkanes from 
carbonyl compounds. The most effective reagent is pertrifluoroacetic acid in 
acetonitrile in the presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate as a buffer. Yields are 
improved by the addition of small quantities of urea to remove oxides of nitro- 
gen. The reaction is illustrated by the conversion of dipropyl ketoxime into 4- 
nitroheptane (Expt 5.190).

Since many aliphatic primary amines are usually prepared by methods not 
involving the reduction of a nitroalkane (cf. aromatic amines), their oxidation 
may provide a useful route to this class of compound. For amines which lead to 
tertiary nitroalkanes, potassium permanganate appears to be the most satisfac- 
tory reagent 198 (the preparation of 2-nitro-2-methylpropane, Expt 5.191). In the 
case of amines which lead to primary or secondary nitroalkanes the oxidant of 
choice is m-chloroperbenzoic acid, and Expt 5.191 includes a general procedure 
for this reaction. 199

CAUTION: The reactions involving hydrogen peroxide and pertrifluoroacetic 
acid should be carried out in a fume cupboard behind a safety screen. Adequate 
precautions should be observed in handling the hydrogen peroxide solution (1). 

Dipropyl ketoxime (heptan-4-one oxime). Heat a mixture of 20 g (0. 1 8 mol) of 
heptan-4-one, 17 g (0.25 mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 19.6 g (20 ml, 
0.25 mol) of pyridine and 1 50 ml of ethanol under reflux for 1 hour in a 500- 
ml round-bottomed flask. Rearrange the condenser for downward distillation 
and remove the ethanol on the water bath. Allow the residue in the flask to 
cool and add 150 ml of water. Extract the oxime with three 50 ml portions of 
ether. Wash the combined extracts with water and dry over magnesium sul- 
phate. Remove the ether on the rotary evaporator and distil the residue at 
atmospheric pressure. Collect the fraction having b.p. 192-195 °C; the yield is 
18.2g (80%). The oxime shows infrared absorptions at 3300cm" 1 (O — H 
stretch) and 1655 cm" 1 (C=N stretch). 

4-Nitroheprane. Prepare a solution of pertrifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile 
as follows. Place 50 ml of acetonitrile in a two-necked, 250-ml round- 
bottomed flask fitted with a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser. Insert a 
plastic-covered magnetic stirrer follower bar and cool the flask in an ice bath 
sited on the stirrer unit. To the cooled and stirred solution add 5.8 ml 
(0.2mol) of 85 per cent hydrogen peroxide (1) and then 39.0ml (58.1 g, 
0.24 mol) of trifluoroacetic anhydride. Stir the solution for 5 minutes and then 
allow to warm to room temperature. In a three-necked, 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask fitted with a sealed stirrer unit, dropping funnel and reflux 
condenser place 200 ml of acetonitrile, 47 g (0.56 mol) of sodium hydrogen 
carbonate, 2g of urea and 12.9g (0.1 mol) of dipropyl ketoxime. Heat the 
stirred suspension under reflux on the water bath and add dropwise over 90 
minutes the prepared solution of pertrifluoroacetic acid. When the addition is 
complete heat the mixture under reflux for 1 hour. Pour the cooled reaction 
mixture into 600 ml of cold water and extract with four 100 ml portions of 
dichloromethane (note: the organic layer is the upper layer in the first extrac- 
tion, but subsequently it is the lower layer). Wash the combined extracts with

three 100 ml portions of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 
dry over magnesium sulphate. Remove the solvent on the rotary evaporator 
and distil the residue under reduced pressure through a short fractionating 
column packed with glass helices. Site the apparatus behind a safety screen. 
4-Nitroheptane distils at 66-69 °C/2 mmHg; the yield is 8.4 g (58%). A small 
amount of dipropyl ketone is obtained as a forerun. The infrared spectrum of 
the nitroalkane shows absorption at 1555 and 1385 cm" ' attributable to the 
antisymmetric and symmetric stretching of the nitro group. The purity of the 
product may be investigated by g.l.c. using a 10 per cent Silicone oil on 
Chromosorb W column held at 100 °C; the nitroalkane has a slightly shorter 
retention time than the oxime; the ketone is rapidly eluted from the column. 

Note. (1) Considerable care should be exercised when carrying out reactions with 85 
per cent w/v hydrogen peroxide (see also Section 4.2.4J, p. 439). Rubber gloves and a 
face mask should be worn and reactions carried out behind a safety screen. Plenty of 
water should be at hand to wash away any spillages; fire may result if the peroxide is 
spilled on to combustible material. Any spillage on the skin similarly should be 
washed with plenty of water. Care should be taken to avoid the formation of poten- 
tially explosive emulsions with organic materials. Spirit thermometers and not mer- 
cury thermometers should be used; grease on taps and joints should be kept to the 
absolute minimum; safety pipettes must be used for pipetting. Disposal of high test 
perioxide solution may be effected by diluting with a large excess of water. The perox- 
ide used in these experiments was supplied gratis by Interox Chemicals Ltd.

CAUTION: All operations should be conducted behind a safety screen. 

In the course of 15 minutes t-butylamine (1,1-dimethylethylamine, 100 g) 
is added to a stirred solution of potassium permanganate (650 g) in 3 litres of 
water; the temperature rises to 45 °C. The stirring is continued for 8 hours 
without external heating, and the solution is then held at 55 + 5 °C for a 
further 8 hours. The product is isolated by steam distillation and washed with 
dilute hydrochloric acid, then with water and dried. Distillation gives 1 17 g 
(83%) of the tertiary nitro compound, b.p. 127-128 °C, n£ 8 1.3980, m.p. 25- 
26 °C. 

Cognate preparation. General procedure for the oxidation of primary and 
secondary amines using m-chloroperbenzoic acid. 199 m-Chloroperbenzoic 
acid (4.1 g, 0.020 mol, 85% pure) is dissolved in 30 ml of 1,2-dichoroethane in 
a three-necked flask equipped with a condenser and a pressure-equalising 
dropping funnel. The amine (0.0050 mol) in 3-5 ml of solvent is added drop- 
wise to the refluxing peracid solution. Refluxing temperature 83 °C, time 3 
hours. After the addition the reaction mixture is cooled, filtered and washed 
with three 50-ml portions of 1 m sodium hydroxide solution and dried over 
magnesium sulphate. Removal of solvent gives a product which is distilled or 
recrystallised as appropriate. The following amines have been oxidised by 
this procedure: cyclohexylamine, 2-aminobutane, hexylamine, propylamine 
and 2-phenyl-l-aminoethane.

5.15.3 C-ALKYLATION OF NITROALKANES AND OTHER HOMOLOGATION PROCEDURES 

Primary nitroalkanes when treated with two equivalents of butyllithium, in a 
mixed tetrahydrofuran-hexamethylphosphoramide solvent system held at 
— 78 °C, may be doubly deprotonated to give the dilithio derivative (2) via the 
monolithio derivative (1).

The dilithio derivative (2), in contrast to (1), may be C-alkylated 200 or C- 
acylated 201 to give homologous products. 

An alternative and convenient a-alkylation reaction uses a l-alkyl-2,4,6- 
triphenylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate with the monosodio derivative of a prim- 
ary or secondary nitroalkane. 202

The reaction is thought to proceed by a radical chain mechanism (S RJV 1), prob- 
ably first involving a charge transfer complex between cationic species (3) and 
the anionic species (4). The illustrative example is the synthesis of 2-phenylnitro- 
ethane from nitromethane and l-benzyl-2,4,6-triphenylpyridinium tetra- 
fluoroborate (Expt 5.192); this latter compound is prepared from benzylamine 
and 2,4,6-triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (Expt 8.31). 

Other major homologation processes are the nitroaldol reaction, arising from 
the reaction between a nitronate anion and a carbonyl compound, and a 
Michael addition reaction.

Both reaction processes are base catalysed, and the use of alumina (Brockmann 
activity I) at room temperature is a particularly mild method leading to good 
yields of products. 203 

The nitroaldol may be dehydrated to a nitroalkene; in the case of nitroaldols 
arising from aromatic aldehydes this dehydration reaction occurs spontan- 
eously as is illustrated in the preparation of co-nitrostyrene (Expt 6.136). The 
nitroalkenes are important dienophiles in the Diels-Alder reaction (Section 7.6, 
p. 1117). An example of the Michael addition reaction is illustrated in the syn-

thesis of 1,4-dicarbonyl compounds (Section 5.9.3, p. 635) and y-keto carboxylic 
acids (Section 5.14.3, p. 738); these examples exemplify the value of nitroalkanes 
as acyl anion equivalents.

Sodium hydride (0.72 g, 0.03 mol) is dissolved in ethanol (30 ml). Nitro- 
methane (1.83 g, 0.030 mol) is added with stirring, followed by 1 -benzyl- 2,4,6- 
triphenylpyridinium tetrafluoroborate (Expt 8.31) (4.85 g, 0.01 mol). The 
solution is refluxed with stirring for 1 hour: the reaction is followed by t.l.c. 
(silica gel; chloroform). When no further pyridinium compound remains, the 
solution is cooled; the resulting crystalline by-product 2,4,6-triphenylpyridine 
is filtered off. The filtrate is added to water (50 ml), extracted with ether 
(3 x 25 ml) and the extract dried over magnesium sulphate. Dry hydrogen 
chloride is passed into the ethereal extract to remove residual 2,4,6-triphenyl- 
pyridine, and the solution is evaporated under reduced pressure (25 °C/ 
15mmHg). The crude product is distilled in vacuo (15mmHg) to yield 2- 
phenylnitroethane, b.p. 120-130°C/15 mmHg, yield 78 per cent, pure by g.l.c. 
(Carbowax 220M, 200 °C); p.m.r. (CDC1 3 , TMS) 5 3.45 (t,2H), 4.75 (t,2H), 
and 7.50 (s, 5H). 



5.16 ALIPHATIC AMINES 

Amines are classified as primary (RNH 2 ), secondary (R 2 NH), or tertiary (R 3 N). 
The alkyl groups in secondary and tertiary amines can of course be the same or 
different. These latter classes of amines are usually prepared by alkylation at a 

® e 
nitrogen atom, as is also the case with quaternary ammonium salts (R 4 N}X). 

Quaternary ammonium salts having four different alkyl groups are chiral; terti- 
ary amines with three different groups, although chiral, undergo rapid pyrimidal 
inversion and hence autoracemisation, and enantiomeric forms are not isolable. 
Chirality in amines may arise from the presence of a chiral carbon atom in an 
alkyl chain (e.g. ( + )-Ph-CH(NH 2 )-Me). 

Imines (e.g. R-CH 2 -CH=N-R or R-CH 2 -C(R)=N-R) are derived from the 
reaction of primary amines with aldehydes or ketones respectively, and may 
exist in tautomeric equilibrium with the corresponding enamine form, but in 
which the imine form predominates.

The most important general methods for the preparation of aliphatic amines 
are as follows. 

1. The reduction of alkyl azides, alkyl cyanides and amides (Expts 5.193 to 
5.195). 

2. The reduction of nitro compounds and oximes (Expt 5.196). 

3. The reductive alkylation of ammonia or amines (Expt 5.197). 

4. The alkylation of ammonia and its derivatives (Expts 5.198 and 5.199). 

5. Imine and enamine formation (Expt 5.200 and 5.201). 

6. Molecular rearrangements of the Hofmann type (see Expt 6.53). 

Methods for the protection of the amino and imino groups are considered in

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The characteristic i.r. absorption of the stretching vibration of the amino and 
imino groups of primary and secondary amines is clearly visible in the region of 
3300 cm ~ ' ; the bending vibration and the out-of-plane deformation of the 
amino group are usually easily recognised, as the example of the spectrum of 
butylamine (Fig. 3.26) illustrates. The nitrogen-bound protons are frequently 
observed as broad signals in the p.m.r. spectrum of primary and secondary 
amines and their ready exchange with, for example, deuterium oxide is discussed 
on p. 348. The structure of the alkyl groups may be often assigned from the spin- 
spin splitting patterns (p. 341). In the m.s. of aliphatic amines the molecular ion 
is usually very weak or negligible (p. 368). The fragmentation reactions are 
noted in detail on p. 381 where the spectrum of diethylamine (Fig. 3.87) is given. 
The u.v.-visible absorption is not structurally informative. Further illustrative 
spectroscopic interpretations are given in appropriate preparative sections 
below. 

5.16.1 THE REDUCTION OF ALKYL AZIDES. ALKYL CYANIDES AND AMIDES 

As these compounds all possess a nitrogen-containing functional feature, it is 
worth pointing out that they arise from alkyl halides (or methanesulphonates) 
in the case of azides and cyanides, or from carboxylic acid chlorides (in the case 
of amides).

5.16 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



A one-pot PTC reaction procedure for the overall conversion of an alkyl 
halide into a primary amine via an azide is particularly illustrative. 204 Thus the 
reduction of the azide is effected by the addition of sodium borohydride to a 
reaction mixture arising from the PTC displacement reaction of an alkyl halide 
with sodium azide (the preparation of 1-octylamine, Expt 5.193). The reaction 
appears to be applicable to primary and secondary alkyl halides, alkyl methane- 
sulphonates and benzylic halides. 

Alkyl cyanides in general are smoothly reduced to primary amines (giving a 
product having one carbon atom more than the alkyl halide starting material) 
by the action of sodium and ethanol (e.g. the preparation of pentylamine, Expt 
5.194). The use of a metal-acid reducing medium is unsatisfactory since extens- 
ive hydrolysis of the cyano group occurs. Catalytic hydrogenation over a Raney 
nickel catalyst (Section 2.17.1, p. 87), in the presence of excess ammonia to sup- 
press secondary amine formation, is illustrated by the preparation of 2-phenyl- 
ethylamine (cognate preparation in Expt 5.194). The secondary amine may be 
formed by the following sequence.

Lithium aluminium hydride has also been used for the reduction of nitriles to 
amines; a recommended procedure involves the slow addition of the nitrile to at 
least one molar proportion of the reducing agent in a cooled ethereal solu- 
tion. 205 The reduction of nitriles is also effected by the use of sodium trifluoro- 
acetoxyborohydride (from sodium borohydride and trifluoroacetic acid) in 
tetrahydrofuran solution. 206 

Amides may be reduced to the corresponding primary, secondary and terti- 
ary amines with lithium aluminium hydride with a varying degree of success. 
The reagent sodium acetoxyborohydride (1) has been used to reduce a wide 
range of aliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amides to the corres- 
ponding primary and secondary amines; in the case of tertiary amides 
(R-CONR 2 ) sodium trifluoroacetoxyborohydride is the reagent of choice. 207

The reduction of benzamide to benzylamine is the illustrative example (Expt 
5.195). Sodium borohydride with methanesulphonic acid is also a convenient 
and effective reductant for amides, 208 and a general procedure is included in 
Expt 5.195. 



Experiment 5.193 OCTYLAMINE 2 



A mixture of 1-bromooctane (19.3 g, 0.1 mol), hexadecyltributylphos- 
phonium bromide (5.1 g, 0.01 mol), sodium azide (16.2 g, 0.25 mol) and water 
(50 ml) is stirred at 80 °C for 8 hours. The aqueous phase is carefully removed, 



772 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.16 



the organic phase is diluted with toluene (15.5 ml), and then a solution of 
sodium borohydride (1 1.7 g, 0.3 mol) in water (30 ml) is added in 30 minutes. 
The mixture is stirred at 80 °C for 16 hours. The layers are separated and the 
organic phase is extracted with 10 per cent hydrochloric acid. The catalyst is 
recovered from the organic phase by removal of the solvent and is reused as 
isolated. Basification of the acid phase and extraction with ether affords 
octylamine, 11.4g (88%), b.p. 172-174 °C. 

Experiment 5.194 PENTYLAMINE 

Pr-CH 2 -CN -^&gt; Pr-CH 2 -CH 2 -NH 2 

Equip a three- necked 1 -litre flask with a dropping funnel, an efficient 
mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. Place 55 g (2.4 mol) of clean 
sodium and 200 ml of sodium-dried toluene in the flask, heat the mixture 
until the toluene commences to boil and then stir the molten sodium vigor- 
ously thus producing an emulsion. Run in through the dropping funnel a 
mixture of 33g (41.5ml) of butyl cyanide (Expt 5.158) and 60g (76ml) of 
absolute ethanol during 1 hour. During the addition and the subsequent in- 
troduction of ethanol and of water, the stirring should be vigorous and the 
temperature adjusted so that the refluxing is continuous; the heat of reaction 
will, in general, be sufficient to maintain the refluxing. After the butyl cyanide 
solution has been added, introduce gradually a further 60 g (76 ml) of abso- 
lute ethanol. In order to destroy any residual sodium, treat the reaction mix- 
ture slowly with 40 g (50 ml) of rectified spirit and then with 20 g of water. 
Steam distil the contents of the flask (compare Fig. 2.102) (about 2 hours) and 
add 40 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the distillate. Separate the 
toluene layer; evaporate the aqueous layer, which contains alcohol and 
amine hydrochloride, to dryness under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator). 
Treat the resulting amine hydrochloride with a solution of 40 g of sodium 
hydroxide in 200 ml of water. Separate the amine layer, dry it by shaking with 
sodium hydroxide pellets (prolonged contact is required for complete drying) 
and distil. Collect the fraction boiling at 102-105 °C as pure pentylamine. Dry 
the fraction of low boiling point again over sodium hydroxide and redistil; 
this gives an additional quantity of amine. The total yield is 30 g (86%). 

Cognate preparation. 2-Phenylethylamine. Saturate commercial absolute 
methanol with ammonia (derived from a cylinder) at °C; the resulting solu- 
tion is c. 10 m. Dissolve 58 g (0.5 mol) of benzyl cyanide (Expt 5.157) (1) in 
300 ml of the cold methanolic ammonia, and place the solution in a high- 
pressure hydrogenation bomb (Section 2.17.1, p. 95), add 10 ml of settled 
Raney nickel catalyst (Section 4.2.50, p. 450), securely fasten the cap and in- 
troduce hydrogen until the pressure is 500-1000 lb. Set the mechanical stir- 
ring device in motion, and heat at 100-125 °C until absorption of hydrogen 
ceases (about 2 hours). Allow the bomb to cool, open it and remove the con- 
tents. Rinse the bomb with two 100 ml portions of anhydrous methanol and 
pour the combined liquids through a fluted filter paper to remove the cata- 
lyst; do not permit the catalyst to become dry since it is likely to ignite. 
Remove the solvent and ammonia by distillation (fume cupboard), and frac- 
tionate the residue through a short column. Collect the 2-phenylethylamine 
at 92-93°C/18mmHg. The yield is 54 g (90%).

lyst; it is advisable to distil the benzyl cyanide from Raney nickel.

CAUTION: Hydrogen gas is evolved in these reactions. 

To a stirred suspension of sodium borohydride (1.89 g, 50mmol) and ben- 
zamide (1.21, lOmmol) in dioxane (20ml) is added acetic acid (3.0g, 
50 mmol) in dioxane (10 ml) over a period of 10 minutes at 10 °C; the reaction 
mixture is stirred at reflux for 2 hours. The reaction mixture is concentrated 
to dryness in vacuo, excess reagent is decomposed with water and the solution 
extracted with chloroform. The extract is washed with water and dried over 
anhydrous sodium sulphate. The chloroform layer is treated with dry hydro- 
gen chloride, evaporated in vacuo and the residue recrystallised from 
methanol-ether to give benzylamine hydrochloride (1.09 g, 76.2%). 

Cognate preparation. General procedure for the reduction of amides with 
sodium borohydride I methanesulphonic acid in dimethyl sulphoxide. 109 To a 

vented 100-ml two-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, are added 
16 mmol of amide, 1.61 g (40 mmol) of sodium borohydride, and 20 ml of 
dimethyl sulphoxide. Methanesulphonic acid (CAUTION) (freshly distilled 
prior to use, b.p. 112-1 14 °C/0.5mmHg) (3.4 ml, 55 mmol) and 20 ml of 
dimethyl sulphoxide are mixed and added dropwise to the reaction mixture 
by means of an addition funnel over a 30-minute period. During this addition 
the reaction mixture is constantly stirred with the magnetic stirrer. Gas is 
evolved during the addition of acid and a gelatinous substance is formed, 
which dissolves when the acid comes to exceed the sodium borohydride on a 
molar basis. At the end of this time, if the reduction product is to be a primary 
or secondary amine, the reaction mixture is quenched by the addition of 
20 ml of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide. If the product is to be a tertiary amine, 
the reaction mixture is kept at 70 °C for 2 hours to liberate the product from 
what appears to be a complex with borane. After this additional reaction 
period tertiary amines are isolated in the same way as primary and secondary 
amines. After the reaction is quenched, the product is extracted from the reac- 
tion mixture with three 10-ml portions of dichloromethane. The product 
solution is then washed with three 10-ml portions of 0.1 m sodium hydroxide 
to remove most of the residual dimethyl sulphoxide, and the product is 
extracted into three 10-ml portions of 10 per cent hydrochloric acid. Neutrali- 
sation with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide, followed by extraction with three 
10-ml portions of dichloromethane, drying over calcium sulphate and frac- 
tional distillation affords the amine. In this way hexanamide gives hexyl- 
amine, b.p. 38-40 °C/25 mmHg, 74 per cent yield; acetanilide gives JV- 
ethylaniline, b.p. 90-91 °C/1 5 mmHg, 77 per cent yield; JV,JV-dimethylbenz- 
amide gives JV,JV-dimethylbenzylamine, b.p. 73-77 °C/22 mmHg, 59 per cent 
yield. 

5.16.2 THE REDUCTION OF NITRO COMPOUNDS AND OXIMES 

These methods are particularly useful for branched chain primary amines. 

774 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.16 



Although the reduction of nitro compounds is more widely applied in the aro- 
matic series using procedures discussed in Section 6.5.1, p. 890, these are equally 
applicable to the reduction of primary or secondary nitroalkanes when these are 
readily available. oe,/?-Unsaturated nitro compounds (arising for example from 
the Claisen-Schmidt reaction, Section 6.12.2, p. 1032) may be reduced to the 
saturated amine very effectively with sodium dihydrobis(2-methoxyethoxy)- 
aluminate ('Red-Al'). 

The ready conversion of aldehydes and ketones into oximes and their sub- 
sequent reduction is more generally applicable to the synthesis of straight and 
branched chain primary aliphatic amines. Reduction with sodium and alcohol is 
convenient and effective and two examples of its use are given in Expt 5.196.

Other methods of reduction include the use of metal-acid systems, catalytic 
hydrogenation over Raney nickel or palladium-on-charcoal, and modified metal 
hydride reducing agents such as 'Red-Al'. 209 

Experiment 5.196 HEPTYLAMINE 

Me-(CH 2 ) 5 -CH=NOH -^&gt; Me-(CH 2 ) 5 -CH 2 -NH 2 

Heptaldoxime. Fit a 1 -litre three-necked flask with an efficient mechanical 
stirrer, a double surface condenser and a thermometer. Place 1 15 g (141ml, 
1.25 mol) of heptanal (1) and a solution of 87 g of hydroxylamine hydro- 
chloride in 150 ml of water in the flask, and stir the mixture vigorously (2). 
Introduce, from a separatory funnel down the reflux condenser, a solution of 
67 g (0.63 mol) of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 250 ml of water at such a 
rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 45 °C. 
Continue the stirring for 1 hour at room temperature. Separate the upper 
layer and wash the oil with two 25 ml portions of water; dry with magnesium 
sulphate. Distil from a flask fitted with a short fractionating column. A small 
fraction of low boiling point (containing heptanenitrile and heptaldoxime) 
passes over first, and as soon as the temperature is constant the heptaldoxime 
is collected (e.g. at 103-107 °C/6mmHg); the temperature of the oil bath is 
maintained at about 30 °C above the boiling point of the liquid. The yield is 
about 1 10 g, and the liquid slowly solidifies on cooling and melts at 44-46 °C; 
it is sufficiently pure for conversion into heptylamine. If required pure, the 
heptaldoxime may be recrystallised from 60 per cent ethanol (25 g of solid to 
70 ml of solvent) and then melts at 53-55 °C (the m.p. depends somewhat 
upon the rate of heating). 

Heptylamine. In a 3-litre round-bottomed flask, equipped with two large 
Liebig condensers (34/35 joints) joined in series, place a solution of 64.5 g 
(0.5 mol) of heptaldoxime in 1 litre of super-dry ethanol (Section 4. 1 .9, p. 401 ) 
and heat on a water bath. Immediately the alcohol boils, remove the flask 
from the water bath and introduce 125 g (5.4 mol) of sodium, cut in small 
pieces, as rapidly as possible through the condenser consistent with keeping 
the vigorous reaction under control. The last 30 g of sodium melts in the hot 
mixture and may be added very rapidly without appreciable loss of alcohol or 

775 



5.16 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



of amine. As soon as the sodium has completely dissolved (some warming 
may be necessary), cool the contents of the flask and dilute with 1250 ml of 
water. At once equip the flask with a condenser set for downward distillation 
and arrange for the distillate to be collected in a solution of 75 ml of concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid in 75 ml of water contained in a 3-litre flask. Con- 
tinue the distillation as long as amine passes over. Towards the end of the 
reaction considerable frothing sets in; then add a further 750 ml of water to 
the distillation flask. The total distillate is 2-2.2 litres and contains alcohol, 
water and some unreacted oxime as well as the amine hydrochloride. Evapor- 
ate the solution under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator; the amine 
hydrochloride will crystallise out in the flask. Cool the flask, attach a reflux 
condenser and introduce 250 ml of 40 per cent potassium hydroxide solution. 
Rotate the flask to wash down the hydrochloride from the sides of the flask, 
cool the mixture to room temperature and transfer it to a separatory funnel. 
Run off the lower alkaline layer and add solid potassium hydroxide to the 
amine in the funnel. Again remove the lower aqueous layer, add more solid 
potassium hydroxide and repeat the process until no further separation of an 
aqueous layer occurs. Finally, transfer the amine to a small flask and leave it 
in contact with potassium hydroxide pellets for 24 hours. Decant the amine 
into a flask and distil through a well-lagged fractionating column. Collect the 
heptylamine at 153-157 °C. The yield is 40 g (70%). 

Notes. (1) The heptanal should be dried and redistilled: b.p. 150-156 °C or 54-59 °C/ 
16mmHg. 

(2) The solution may be rendered homogeneous by the addition of ethanol but the 
yield appears to be slightly diminished and more high boiling point material is pro- 
duced. 

Cognate preparation. Hexyl methyl ketoxime. From hexyl methyl ketone 
(octan-2-one) (Expt 5.86) in 90 per cent yield; b.p. 106-108 °C/1 2 mmHg. 

1-Methylheptylamine. Reflux a solution of 50 g (0.35 mol) of the oxime in 
200 ml of super-dry ethanol on a water bath while adding 75 g (3.25 mol) of 
sodium; introduce more alcohol (about 300 ml) to maintain a vigorous reac- 
tion. When all the sodium has passed into solution, cool, dilute with 250 ml of 
water and distil gently until the b.p. reaches 96 °C; add a further 200 ml of 
water and repeat the distillation to ensure the complete removal of the alco- 
hol. The amine remains as a layer on the strongly alkaline solution: extract it 
with ether, dry the ethereal solution with sodium hydroxide or anhydrous 
calcium sulphate, remove the ether on a water bath, and distil the residue 
under diminished pressure. Collect the 1-methylheptylamine at 58-59 °C/ 
1 3 mmHg; the b.p. under atmospheric pressure is 1 63-1 64 °C. The yield is 3 1 g 
(69%). 

5.16.3 REDUCTIVE ALKYLATION OF AMMONIA OR AMINES 

The process of reductive alkylation involves the treatment of ammonia or prim- 
ary or secondary amines with an aldehyde or ketone under reducing conditions. 
The conversion in the case of ammonia or primary amines and a carbonyl 
compound probably involves the following stages.

A retrosynthetic analysis for a target molecule of either a primary or second- 
ary amine is therefore a two-stage process; first an FGI to reveal an imine, and 
then a disconnection to ammonia (or primary amine) and the carbonyl com- 
pound. 

When secondary amines are used the intermediate aminol cannot give rise to 
an imine and the tertiary amine product is formed by a hydrogenolytic pathway.

The reduction is usually effected catalytically in ethanol solution using 
hydrogen under pressure in the presence of Raney nickel. As in the reduction of 
nitriles (Section 5.16.1, p. 771), which also involves the intermediate imine, 
ammonia or the amines should be present in considerable excess to minimise the 
occurrence of undesirable side reactions leading to the formation of secondary 
and tertiary amines. These arise from the further reaction of the carbonyl com- 
pound with the initially formed amine product. Selected experimental con- 
ditions for these reductive alkylation procedures have been well reviewed. 210 
Sodium borohydride has also been used as an in situ reducing agent and is par- 
ticularly effective with mixtures of primary amines and aliphatic aldehydes and 
ketones. 211

A major variation is the use of formic acid or one of its derivatives as the 
reductant (the Leuckart reaction). In the synthesis of 1-phenylethylamine (Expt 
5.197), ammonium formate is heated with aceptophenone while the water 
formed in the reaction is carefully removed by fractional distillation to give the 
required amine as its JV-formyl derivative, (l-phenylethyl)formamide. This is 
then hydrolysed with acid to yield the primary amine. The procedure has been 
satisfactorily applied to many aliphatic-aromatic, alicyclic and aliphatic- 
heterocyclic ketones, some aromatic ketones and aldehydes, and to some ali- 
phatic aldehydes and ketones boiling at about 100 °C or higher.

Place 126g (2.0 mol) of ammonium formate, 72 g (0.6 mol) of acetophenone 
and a few chips of porous porcelain in a 250-ml flask fitted with a Claisen 
still-head carrying a short fractionating column; insert a thermometer extend- 
ing nearly to the bottom of the flask, and attach a short condenser set for 
downward distillation to the side-arm. Heat the flask with a heating mantle 
or in an air bath; the mixture first melts to two layers and distillation occurs. 
The mixture becomes homogeneous at 150-1 55 °C and reaction takes place 
with slight frothing. Continue the heating, more slowly if necessary, until the 
temperature rises to 185 °C (about 2 hours); acetophenone, water and ammo- 
nium carbonate distil. Stop the heating at 185 °C, separate the upper layer of 
acetophenone from the distillate and return it without drying to the flask. 
Heat the mixture for 3 hours at 180-185 °C and then allow to cool; the aceto- 
phenone may be recovered from the distillate by extraction with 20 ml por- 
tions of toluene (1). Transfer the reaction mixture to a 250-ml separatory 
funnel and shake it with two 75 ml portions of water to remove formamide 
and ammonium formate. Transfer the crude (l-phenylethyl)formamide into 
the original reaction flask; extract the aqueous layer with two 20 ml portions 
of toluene, transfer the toluene extracts to the flask, add 75 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid and a few chips of porous porcelain. Heat the mixture cau- 
tiously until about 40 ml of toluene are collected, and boil gently under reflux 
for a further 40 minutes; hydrolysis proceeds rapidly to 1-phenylethylamine 
hydrochloride except for a small layer of unchanged acetophenone. Allow the 
reaction mixture to cool, remove the acetophenone by extraction with four 
20 ml portions of toluene (1). Transfer the aqueous acid solution to a 500-ml 
round-bottomed flask equipped for steam distillation, cautiously add a solu- 
tion of 6.5 g of sodium hydroxide in 125 ml of water, and steam distil; heat the 
distillation flask so that the volume remains nearly constant. Most of the 
amine is contained in the first 500 ml of distillate; stop the operation when the 
distillate is only faintly alkaline. Extract the distillate with five 25 ml portions 
of toluene, dry the extract with sodium hydroxide pellets and fractionally 
distil (2). Toluene distils over at 1 1 1 °C, followed by the phenylethylamine. 
Collect the latter as a fraction of b.p. 1 80-190 °C (the bulk of the product dis- 
tils at 184-1 86 °C (3); the yield is 43 g (59%). 

Notes. (1) The acetophenone may be recovered by washing the toluene solution with 
dilute alkali, drying with anhydrous calcium sulphate and distilling; the fraction, b.p. 
198-205 °C, is collected. 

(2) Ground glass apparatus must be used as the amine attacks rubber (and cork). 
Since the product absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, attach the receiving flask to the 
condenser with a take-off adapter carrying a soda-lime guard-tube. 

(3) The b.p. under diminished pressure is 80-81 °C/18mmHg. To obtain a very pure 
sample of the amine, dissolve 1 part (by weight) of the above product in a solution of 
1.04 parts of crystallised oxalic acid in 8 parts of hot water, add a little decolourising 



778 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.16 



carbon and filter. The filtered solution deposits crystals of the oxalate salt; about 5 g of 
this salt remains in each 100 ml of mother-liquor, but most can be recovered by evap- 
oration and further crystallisation. The amine may be liberated from its oxalate salt 
with sodium or potassium hydroxide, steam distillation and purification as described 
above. The salt provides a convenient method of obtaining a known weight of the 
amine in water, since it can be weighed out and decomposed with alkali hydroxide. 

5.16.4 THE ALKYLATION OF AMMONIA AND ITS DERIVATIVES 

A C — N disconnection of a primary amine gives rise to the carbocation and 
amide anion synthons. It might be predicted therefore that treatment of an alkyl 
halide with ammonia (reagents equivalent to the above synthons) under pres- 
sure would constitute a suitable synthesis of a primary amine. In practice, how- 
ever, the yield is poor since a mixture of all three classes of amines, together with 
some of the quaternary ammonium salt, is obtained, owing to more ready 
further alkylation of the sequentially formed products.

A similar ammonolysis of alcohols in the presence of certain metallic oxide cata- 
lysts is, however, extensively used on the large scale for the manufacture of all 
classes of amines. 

An alternative reagent equivalent for the amide anion synthon is the potas- 
sium salt of phthalimide which can only react with one molecular proportion of 
alkyl halide. The resulting JV-alkylphthalimide is then cleaved to the primary 
amine (the Gabriel synthesis). The preliminary preparation of potassium phthal- 
imide (from a solution of phthalimide in absolute ethanol and potassium 
hydroxide in 75% ethanol) may be avoided in some cases by boiling phthalimide 
with the halide in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The cleavage 
of the JV-substituted phthalimide is best effected by reaction with hydrazine 
hydrate and then heating the reaction mixture with hydrochloric acid. The in- 
soluble phthalylhydrazide is filtered off, leaving the amine hydrochloride in 
solution from which the amine may be liberated and isolated in the appropriate 
manner.

The Gabriel synthesis is illustrated by the preparation of benzylamine and 2- 
phenylethylamine (Expt 5.198). 

The preparation of pure symmetrical secondary amines (e.g. dibutylamine, 
Expt 5.199) is conveniently achieved by the hydrolysis of dialkylcyanamides 
with dilute sulphuric acid. The appropriate dialkyl cyanamide is prepared by 
treating sodium cyanamide (itself obtained from calcium cyanamide and 
aqueous sodium hydroxide solution) with an alkyl halide. In this case the 
reagent [:$ — C=N] 2e may be regarded as a masked NH group.

A-Benzylphthalimide. Grind together 76 g (0.55 mol) of finely powdered, 
anhydrous potassium carbonate and 147g (1 mol) of phthalimide (Expt 
6.155) in a glass mortar, transfer the mixture to a round-bottomed flask and 
treat it with 151 g (1.2 mol) of redistilled benzyl chloride. Heat in an oil bath 
at 190 °C under a reflux condenser for 3 hours. While the mixture is still hot, 
remove the excess of benzyl chloride by steam distillation. The benzylphthal- 
imide commences to crystallise near the end of the steam distillation. At this 
point, cool the mixture rapidly with vigorous swirling so that the solid is 
obtained in a fine state of division. Filter the solid with suction on a Buchner 
funnel, wash well with water and drain as completely as possible; then wash 
once with 200 ml of 60 per cent ethanol and drain again. The yield of crude 
product, m.p. 100-1 10 °C, is 180 g (76%). Recrystallise from glacial acetic acid 
to obtain pure benzylphthalimide, m.p. 116°C: the recovery is about 80 per 
cent. 

Benzylamine. Warm an alcoholic suspension of 1 18.5 g (0.5 mol) of finely 
powdered benzylphthalimide with 25 g (0.5 mol) of 100 per cent hydrazine 
hydrate (CAUTION: corrosive liquid, see Section 4.2.31, p. 436): a white, gela- 
tinous precipitate is produced rapidly. Decompose the latter (when its forma- 
tion appears complete) by heating with excess of hydrochloric acid on a 
steam bath. Collect the phthalylhydrazide which separates by suction filtra- 
tion, and wash it with a little water. Concentrate the filtrate by distillation on 
a rotary evaporator to remove alcohol, cool, filter from the small amount of 
precipitated phthalylhydrazide, render alkaline with excess of sodium

hydroxide solution and extract the liberated benzylamine with ether. Dry the 
ethereal solution with potassium hydroxide pellets, remove the solvent 
(rotary evaporator) and finally distil the residue. Collect the benzylamine at 
185-187 °C: the yield is 50 g (94%). 

Cognate preparation. 2-Phenylethylamine. Prepare 2-phenylethylphthali- 
mide as above by substituting 2-phenylethyl bromide (Expt 5.55) for benzyl

132°C. Convert it into 2-phenylethylamine by treatment with hydrazine 
hydrate and hydrochloric acid as described for benzylamine. The yield of 
2-phenylethylamine, b.p. 200-205 °C, is about 95 per cent.

Dibutyl cyanamide. Equip a 2-litre three-necked flask with a reflux condenser 
and a sealed stirrer unit. Place 220 ml of water and 50 g of finely crushed ice in 
the flask and add slowly, with vigorous stirring, 70 g (0.46 mol) of commercial 
calcium cyanamide (1). As soon as the solid is thoroughly suspended, fit a 
separatory funnel into the third neck of the flask and introduce through it a 
cold solution of 34 g (0.85 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 70 ml of water; replace 
the funnel by a thermometer. Continue the vigorous stirring for 1 hour to 
complete the decomposition of the calcium cyanamide; if the temperature 
rises above 25 °C, add a little more ice. Add to the resulting solution of 
sodium cyanamide a solution of 134 g (195 ml, 1 mol) of butyl bromide (Expt 
5.54) in 220 ml of rectified spirit. Heat the mixture, with stirring, on a water 
bath until it refluxes gently; continue the refluxing and stirring for 2.5 hours. 
Replace the reflux condenser by one set for downward distillation and distil 
the mixture until 165-170 ml of liquid are collected: stir during distillation. 
Cool the residue in the flask and filter it, with suction, through a Buchner or 
sintered glass funnel, and wash the residue with rectified spirit. Extract the fil- 
trate, which separates into two layers, first with 90 ml and then with 45 ml of 
benzenes Dry the combined benzene extracts with anhydrous calcium sul- 
phate, and remove the benzene on a rotary evaporator. Distil under reduced 
pressure and collect the dibutul cyanamide at 147-161 °C/35 mm. The yield is 
33g(47%). 

Dibutylamine. Into a 1 -litre round- bottomed flask furnished with a reflux 
condenser place a solution of 34 g (18.5 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in 
100 ml of water: add 33 g (0.2 mol) of dibutyl cyanamide and a few fragments 
of porous porcelain. Reflux gently for 6 hours. Cool the resulting homo- 
geneous solution and pour in a cold solution of 52 g of sodium hydroxide in 
95 ml of water down the side of the flask so that most of it settles at the 
bottom without mixing with the solution in the flask. Connect the flask with a 
condenser for downward distillation and shake it to mix the two layers; the 
free amine separates. Heat the flask, when the amine with some water distils: 
continue the distillation until no amine separates from a test portion of the 
distillate. Estimate the weight of water in the distillate and add about half this

amount of potassium hydroxide in the form of pellets so that it dissolves 
slowly. Cool the solution in ice while the alkali hydroxide is dissolving; some 
ammonia gas is evolved. When the potassium hydroxide has dissolved, separ- 
ate the amine, and dry it for 24 hours over sodium hydroxide pellets. Filter 
and distil from a flask fitted with a Claisen still-head. Collect the dibutyl- 
amine at 157-160 °C. The yield is 21 g (75%). 

Note. (1) Also known as 'nitrolim'. The fresh product contains approximately 55 per 
cent of calcium cyanamide, 20 per cent of lime, 12 per cent of graphite and small 
amounts of other impurities. It should be protected from moisture when stored in 
order to prevent slow polymerisation to dicyanodiamide. 



5.16.5 IMINE AND ENAMINE FORMATION 212 

Imines are formed by the reaction of a primary amine with aldehydes or ketones 
with the simultaneous removal of water, for example by azeotropic distilla- 
tion, 213 by the addition of anhydrous sodium sulphate, 214 by the addition of 
molecular sieves, 215 or by the use of titanium(iv) chloride. 216 When one, or 
both, of the reactants is aromatic, the imine is quite stable and usually known as 
a Schiff base (see Section 6.5.5, p. 902). In the case of wholly aliphatic reactants 
the imines tend to decompose or polymerise; in these cases their further reaction 
is carried out without delay.

A typical procedure involving water removal with anhydrous potassium car- 
bonate 217 is described in Expt 5.200 for the preparation of JV-(l,l-methylethyl)- 
2-methylpropylimine. The imines are important synthetic intermediates and 
some of these aspects have been outlined in Section 5.16.3 above, Section 6.5.5, 
p. 902, and Section 5.7.8, p. 600. 

Enamines are the stable products of a similar reaction between secondary 
amines (such as pyrrolidine or morpholine) and aldehydes and ketones. 218 
These vinylamines are reactive reagents of value in synthesis; they function as 
specific enol equivalents of carbonyl compounds, readily undergoing alkylation 
and acylation processes (e.g. Section 5.9.2, p. 632). 





As with imines, enamine formation may be achieved using azeotropic distilla- 
tion, 219 or with the aid of molecular sieves. The procedure described in Expt 
5.201 for the preparation of the enamine from morpholine and diisobutyl ketone 
utilises titanium(iv) chloride as a catalyst and water scavenger. 220 

The reaction of an amine with, principally, formaldehyde, followed by further 
reaction with compounds having active hydrogen atoms, give rise to the 
Mannich bases which are discussed in Sections 5.18.2, p. 801, and 6.12.7, p. 1050.

2-Methylpropanal (72 g, 1.0 mol) is added dropwise and with stirring during 
2 hours to 1,1-dimethylethylamine (t-butylamine) (73 g 1.0 mol). During the 
addition the temperature rises from 25 to 40 °C and an aqueous layer separ- 
ates near the end of the addition. The organic layer is treated with anhydrous 
potassium carbonate (15 g), stirred at 25 °C for 17 hours, and then decanted 
on to barium oxide (12 g). After the mixture has been stirred for 10 hours, it is 
filtered and the organic filtrate is distilled to separate the imine as a colourless

To a vigorously stirred, cold (0°C) solution of morpholine (680 g, 7.8 mol) in 
1500 ml of hexane is added a solution of titanium(iv) chloride (146 ml, 
1.33 mol) in 300 ml of hexane. After the addition is complete diisobutyl 
ketone (142.2g, 1.0 mol) is added in one portion. The cooling bath is removed 
and the reaction allowed to proceed under reflux for 2 hours. After cooling, the 
mixture is filtered through a sintered glass filter and the solvent removed under 
reduced pressure, giving a yellow oil which is distilled under reduced pressure. 
The yield of enamine is 171.4g (87.7%), b.p. 106-108 °C/10mmHg (1). 

Note. (1) This method has been successfully applied to a very large range of straight 
and branched chain aliphatic ketones. 

5.16.6 MOLECULAR REARRANGEMENTS OF THE HOFMANN TYPE 

By treatment of an amide with sodium hypobromite or sodium hypochlorite 
solution (or with halogen admixed with aqueous alkali), a primary amine 
having one less carbon atom is produced. Good yields are obtained when the 
reaction is applied to most aliphatic and aromatic amides. Examples are pro- 
vided by the preparation of anthranilic acid and 3-aminopyridine (Expt 6.53). 
The conversion of an amide in this way is termed the Hofmann reaction or the 
Hofmann rearrangement. The mechanism of the reaction involves an intra- 
molecular 1,2-carbon-to-nitrogen nucleophilic shift of the alkyl (or aryl) group 

783 



5.16 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



in the bromo amide anion (2) to form an isocyanate, which is hydrolysed to the 
primary amine by the aqueous base present.

(2) 

An important consequence of the mechanism of the rearrangement step is that if 
the migrating group R is attached to the amide carbonyl via a chiral carbon 
atom the configration is retained in the product, thus generating a fully optically 
active amine from optically active starting material (e.g. 2-phenylpropanamide). 
If the reaction is carried out by treating the amide with bromine and sodium 
methoxide in methanol, the alkyl isocyanate intermediate is trapped as the N- 
alkylurethane (3) which can subsequently be hydrolysed to the primary amine.

(3) 

With long chain (C &gt; 8) alkanamides this modification gives better yields than 
those obtained by the standard procedure. 221 

A closely related reaction of general applicability is the Curtius rearrange- 
ment 222 of acyl azides. The rearranging species in the Schmidt reaction (see 
p. 898) is in fact also a protonated acyl azide; these azides are readily prepared by 
the action of nitrous acid on acyl hydrazides which are themselves formed from 
esters and hydrazine (Section 9.6.17, p. 1269). On heating in aprotic solvents the 
acyl azides decompose to yield the corresponding isocyanates in good yield. 

5.16.7 SOME METHODS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE AMINO AND IMINO GROUPS 

Only a restricted selection of the very great number of methods for the protec- 
tion of the amino and imino groups is possible here. These have often been de- 
veloped for the protection of the amino group in an amino acid for the purpose 
of peptide synthesis. Those considered below are: (a) JV-acyl derivatives; (b) car- 
bamates; and (c) phthalimides. 

7V-ACYL DERIVATIVES 

The commonly encountered compounds in this class are the formyl, acetyl and 
benzoyl derivatives. The formation of the N-formyl compound is readily accom- 
plished by heating the amino compound with formic acid in the presence of 
acetic anhydride. 223 Alternatively, formic acid in the presence of dicyclohexl- 
carbodiimide (DCC) in pyridine solution is a suitable method for the protection 
of amino acid esters. 224 

General procedure for the formation of 7V-formyl derivatives of a-amino acids. 223 

Acetic anhydride (83 ml) is added dropwise to a mixture of approximately 
0.10 mol of the amino acid in 250 ml of 85 per cent formic acid at a rate to main- 
tain the temperature of the mixture between 50 and 60 °C. After the addition is 
complete, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour at the end of 
which time 80 ml of icewater is introduced, and the mixture is concentrated 



784 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.16 



under reduced pressure. The crystalline residue is recrystallised from water or 
aqueous ethanol. 

The JV-formyl group is stable providing hot aqueous acid or alkaline con- 
ditions are avoided. Deprotection is affected by prolonged hot alkaline hydroly- 
sis, or in the case of protected amino acids, by oxidative 225 or reductive 
procedures. 226 

N-Acetyl and N-benzoyl derivatives may be readily prepared from the cor- 
responding acid chloride or, in the case of acetyl derivatives, acetic anhydride. 
General procedures are detailed in Sections 9.6.21, p. 1273, and 9.6.23, p. 1279, 
and the use of JV-acetyl derivatives in amino acid synthesis is to be found, for 
example, in Expts 5.183 and 5.184. 

Deprotection may be effected by vigorous acidic or alkaline hydrolysis 
(p. 918). Alternative methods of deprotection are sodium hydride in refluxing 
dimethoxyethane, 227 or by heating with 85 per cent hydrazine hydrate (hydra- 
zinolysis). 228 

CARBAMATES 

The two commonest examples are the benzyl carbamates (CBZ derivatives) (4) 
and the t-butyl carbamates (BOC derivatives) (5) where the amino group is pro- 
tected by the benzyloxycarbonyl or the t-butyloxycarbonyl groups respectively. 

O O 

A ^ A /Bu- 

(4) (5) 

An illustrative example of the introduction of the benzyloxycarbonyl group, 
and its removal by hydrogenolysis is given in the synthesis of L-prolylglycine 
(Expt 5.188). An alternative reagent for the removal of this protecting group is 
iodotrimethylsilane in acetonitrile at room temperature. 229 

The conversion of the amino group in amino acids into a t-butyloxycarbonyl 
group is a process which is widely used in automated peptide synthesis carried 
out on solid (polymeric) supports (solid phase synthesis; the Merrifield tech- 
nique). 230 

t-Butyloxycarbonyl derivatives may be prepared by reacting the amino acid 
with t-butyl azidoformate while maintaining the pH at about 9.5 by the con- 
trolled addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide solution using an autotitrator 
(pH stat), and then liberating the product by careful acidification of the reaction 
mixture to pH 3 with citric acid. 231

Although it has been on the market for some time, the reagent is no longer com- 
mercially available however. One convenient route for its preparation, starting 
from phenyl chloroformate, proceeds as formulated below; concise details have 
been published. 232 The reagent is toxic and is best prepared as required and 
used in the crude state, since it may explode on distillation or storage.

Alternatively, acylation with di-t-butyl pyrocarbonate 233 has been recom- 
mended as a general procedure for the preparation of t-butyloxycarbonyl amino 
acids. 234

Procedure for BOC-amino acids. A solution of the amino acid (10 mol) in a mix- 
ture of dioxane (20 ml), water (10 ml) and 1 m sodium hydroxide (10 ml) is stirred 
and cooled in an ice-water bath. Di-t-butyl pyrocarbonate (1) (2.4 g, 1 1 mmol) is 
added and stirring is continued at room temperature for 30 minutes. The solu- 
tion is concentrated in vacuo to about 10-15 ml, cooled in an ice-water bath, 
covered with a layer of ethyl acetate (30 ml) and acidified with dilute aqueous 
potassium hydrogen sulphate solution to pH 2-3 (Congo red). The aqueous 
phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 15 ml). The ethyl acetate extracts are 
pooled, washed with water (2 x 30 ml), dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate 
and evaporated in vacuo. The residue is recrystallised with a suitable solvent (e.g. 
ethyl acetate-hexane). 

Note. (1) Commercially available, designated as di-t-butyl-dicarbonate. It melts at 20- 
22 °C and should be stored in a refrigerator. 

Deprotection. The BOC group is easily removed under quite mildly acidic con- 
ditions, a feature which underlines its value in selective deprotection in peptide 
synthesis. Typically, treatment at room temperature for 30^60 minutes with a 1 
m solution of hydrogen chloride in acetic acid, or with neat trifluoroacetic acid, 
is used. It is of interest that after t.l.c. of BOC-amino acids, brief exposure of the 
plates to hydrogen chloride fumes enables the ninhydrin reaction to be used to 
detect the presence of the liberated free amino acids. 

PHTHALIMIDES 

These may be prepared from a primary amine by reaction with phthalic anhyd- 
ride. The general procedure described in Section 9.6.21, p. 1276 uses glacial acetic 
acid; reaction conditions using chloroform as the solvent medium have been re- 
ported. 235 Deprotection using hydrazine is described in Expt 5.198. 



5.17 ALIPHATIC SULPHUR COMPOUNDS 

The simpler aliphatic sulphur derivatives considered in this section are the sul- 
phur analogues of oxygen compounds, e.g. the thiols (RSH), and the symmet- 
rical or unsymmetrical thioethers (R-S-R or R'-S*R 2 ). Compounds derived from 
these two groups, where the sulphur atom can attain a higher oxidation state, 
are the sulphinic and sulphonic acids (R-SOOH and R-S0 2 "OH), the sulphox- 
ides (R-SO-R), and the sulphones (R-S0 2 - R). Other compounds of interest 
which are considered in the following discussion are: 

the dialkyldisulphides (R-S-S-R: sulphur analogues of the peroxides); 

sulphonium salts [e.g. trimethylsulphonium halides (1)]; 

thioacetals [e.g. 2-ethyl-l,3-dithiane (2)]; 

0,S-dialkyldithiocarbonates (xanthate esters, e.g. O-ethyl S-ethyl dithiocarbon- 

ate (3)].

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The characteristic absorption frequencies of this varied group of sulphur com- 
pounds may be inferred by reference to the data given in Appendices 2, 3 and 4. 

5.17.1 THIOLS AND THIOACETALS 

The thiols are the sulphur analogues of the alcohols and were formerly called the 
mercaptans. Although they may be prepared by the interaction of an alkyl halide 
and sodium hydrosulphide in ethanolic solution, a better method involves the 
interaction of an alkyl bromide and thiourea to form an S-alkylisothiouronium 
salt, followed by hydrolysis of the latter with sodium hydroxide solution. 

RBr + NaSH &gt; RSH + NaBr 

2RBr + 2S=C(NH 2 ) 2 &gt; 

2RS-C(=NH 2 )-NH 2 }Br ^^&gt; 2RSH + H 2 N-C(=NH)-NH-CN 

This preparative method is quite general as indicated by the range of examples 
included in Expt 5.202. 

In many cases it is not necessary to prepare the alkyl bromide; the S-alkyliso- 
thiouronium salt may be prepared directly from the alcohol by heating with 
thiourea and concentrated aqueous hydrobromic acid. 236 

The lower members of the thiol series have remarkably disageeable odours, 
but the offensive odour diminishes with increasing carbon content; for example, 
dodecane-1 -thiol is not noticeably unpleasant. 

The preparation and isolation of S-benzylisothiouronium chloride by the 
interaction of benzyl chloride and thiourea is described in Expt 5.203. On recrys- 
tallisation the compound separates in either, or sometimes as both, of two 
dimorphic forms, m.p. 150 and 175 °C respectively. The former may be con- 
verted into the higher m.p. form by dissolving it in ethanol and seeding with 
crystals of the form, m.p. 175 °C: the low m.p. form when warmed to 175 °C 
gives, after solidification, a m.p. of 175 °C. The compound is of particular inter- 
est as a reagent for the characterisation of carboxylic acids or sulphonic acids 
with which it forms the S-benzylisothiouronium carboxylate (or sulphonate) 
salts (Sections 9.6.15, p. 1264, and 9.6.26, p. 1285). Both dimorphic forms 
give identical derivatives. 

Thioacetals, arising from the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone with either 
two moles of a thiol or one mole of a 1,2- or 1,3-dithiol, are useful both as a 
means of protection of a carbonyl group (Section 5.8.8, p. 625) and as important 
intermediates in organic synthesis.

CAUTION: This preparation must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard; 
disposable plastic gloves should be worn when handling thiourea. 

Into a 500-ml two-necked flask, equipped with a sealed stirrer unit and a 
reflux condenser, place 62.5 g (53.5 ml, 0.38 mol) of 1-bromohexane (Expt 
5.55) and a solution of 35 g (0.5 mol) of thiourea in 25 ml of water. Connect a 
tube from the top of the condenser leading to an inverted funnel just 
immersed in potassium permanganate solution in order to prevent the escape 
of unpleasant odours. Stir the mixture vigorously and heat under reflux for 2 
hours; the mixture becomes homogeneous after about 30 minutes and the 
additional heating ensures the completeness of the reaction. Add a solution of 
30 g of sodium hydroxide in 300 ml of water and reflux, with stirring, for a 
further 2 hours; during this period the thiol separates since it is largely insol- 
uble in the alkaline medium. Allow to cool and separate the upper layer of 
almost pure hexane-1 -thiol (35 g). Acidify the aqueous layer with a cold solu- 
tion of 75 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid in 50 ml of water, and extract it 
with 75 ml of ether. Combine the ethereal extract with the crude thiol, dry 
with anhydrous sodium sulphate and remove the ether on a water bath. Distil 
the residue using an air bath (Fig. 2.46(a) and (b)) and collect the hexane-1- 
thiol at 150-1 52 °C. The yield is 37.5 g (84%). 

Cognate preparation. Butane- 1 -thiol. Use 51 g (40 ml, 0.372 mol) of butyl 
bromide (Expt 5.54), 38 g (0.5 mol) of thiourea and 25 ml of water. Reflux, 
with stirring, for 3 hours; the mixture becomes homogeneous after 1 hour. 
Allow to cool and separate the upper layer of the thiol (A). Acidify the 
aqueous layer with a cold solution of 7 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid in 
50 ml of water, cool and saturate with salt; remove the upper layer of butane- 
1-thiol (B) and combine it with (A). Extract the aqueous liquid with 75 ml of 
ether, dry the ethereal extract with sodium sulphate or calcium sulphate and 
distil off the ether from a water bath through a fractionating column. Com- 
bine the residue with {A) and (£), and distil. Collect the butane- 1 -thiol at 97-

General remarks on the preparation of thiols. The above method is of quite 
general application. If the bromoalkane is inexpensive, the extraction with 
ether may be omitted, thus rendering the preparation of thiols a comparat- 
ively easy and not unduly unpleasant operation. The following thiols may be 
prepared in yields of the same order as hexane-1 -thiol and butane- 1 -thiol; 
ethanethiol, b.p. 35-36 °C; propane- 1 -thiol, b.p. 66-67 °C; propane-2-thiol, 
b.p. 51-52°C; 2-methylpropane-l -thiol, b.p. 87-88 °C; pentane-1 -thiol, b.p. 
124-125 °C; heptane- 1 -thiol, b.p. 175-1 76 °C; octane- 1 -thiol, b.p. 198-200 °C 
or 98-100 °C/22mmHg; nonane-1-thiol, b.p. 220-222 °C or 98-100 °C/ 
15mmHg; decane-1 -thiol, b.p. 96-97 °C/5 mmHg or 114°C/13mmHg; 
undecane-1 -thiol, b.p. 103-104 °C/3 mmHg; dodecane-1 -thiol, b.p. 111- 
112°C/3mmHg or 153-1 55 °C/24 mmHg; tetradecane-1 -thiol, b.p. 176- 
180°C/22mmHg; phenylmethanethiol, b.p. 195 °C.

Dissolve 76 g (1 mol) of thiourea in 200 ml of warm water in a 1 -litre round- 
bottomed flask. Dilute the solution with 135 ml of rectified spirit and add 
126.5 g (1 mol) of benzyl chloride. Heat the mixture under reflux on a water 
bath until the benzyl chloride dissolves (about 15 minutes) and for a further 
30 minutes taking care that the mixture is well shaken from time to time. Cool 
the mixture in ice: there is a tendency to supersaturation so that it is advisable 
to stir (or shake) the cold solution vigorously, when the substance crystallises 
suddenly. Filter off the solid at the pump. Evaporate the filtrate to about half 
bulk in order to recover a further small quantity of product. Dry the com- 
pound upon filter paper in the air. The yield of S-benzylisothiouronium 
chloride, m.p. 174 °C, is 200 g (99%). Recrystallise the salt from 400 ml of 0.2 m 
hydrochloric acid; filter off the solid which separates on cooling. The yield of 
recrystallised salt, m.p. 175 °C, is 185 g (91%); some of the dimorphic form, 
m.p. 1 50 °C, may also separate. 

5.17.2 DIALKYL SULPHIDES (THIOETHERS) AND TRIALKYLSULPHONIUM SALTS 

Retrosynthetic C — S disconnection reveals two possible routes to dialkyl sul- 
phides. 

(a) R-JS-J-R =&gt; 2R® + S 2e (b) R'-s1r 2 =&gt; R'-S e + ®R 2 

Formation of a symmetrical sulphide (a) (e.g. dipropyl sulphide, Expt 5.204), is 
conveniently effected by boiling an alkyl halide (the source of carbocations) with 
sodium sulphide in ethanolic solution. Mixed sulphides (b) are prepared by 
alkylation of a thiolate salt (a mercaptide) with an alkyl halide (cf. Williamson's 
ether synthesis, Section 5.6.2, p. 583). In the case of an alkyl aryl sulphide 
(R-S-Ar) where the aromatic ring contains activating nitro groups (see Section 
6.5.3, p. 900), the aryl halide is used with the alkyl thiolate salt. The alternative 
alkylation of a substituted thiophenol is described in Section 8.3.4, p. 1160. The 
former procedure is illustrated by the preparation of isobutyl 2,4-dinitrophenyl 
sulphide (Expt 5.205) from l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and 2-methylpropane- 
1-thiol. 

789 



5.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



A variant of this procedure is provided by the preparation of S-benzyl-L- 
cysteine (Expt 5.206). The required thiolate salt is prepared by the reductive 
cleavage with sodium in liquid ammonia of the disulphide linkage in the amino 
acid, (S)-cystine, and is alkylated in situ with benzyl chloride. The preparation of 
this S-benzyl derivative constitutes a method of protection of the thiol grouping 
in cysteine. 

The use of a cyanoethylation procedure (Section 5.13.3, p. 717) or related 
Michael type addition reactions for the synthesis of functionalised sulphides 
should be noted as an important preparative route.

This general procedure has been used for the preparation of sulphides before 
their conversion into five-membered heterocyclic sulphur systems. 239 

Dialkyl sulphides are converted into trialkylsulphonium salts by treatment 
with an alkyl halide (the bromide or iodide is usually the reactant of choice). An 
important example of this group is trimethylsulphonium iodide, which is used as 
a methylene transfer reagent by virtue of its being converted in the presence of 
base into a sulphur ylide, which is a nucleophilic carbene equivalent.

Examples of its use are to be found in Expt 8.4. 

Dialkyl disulphides, of which (S)-cystine above is an example, may be pre- 
pared from thiols by mild oxidation, usually with iodine in the presence of alkali. 
A convenient synthesis of unsymmetrical analogues results when a symmetrical 
disulphide is heated with thiol to establish an equilibrium mixture. By careful 
choice of the reactants, fractional distillation then removes the more volatile 
thiol leaving the mixed disulphide as a residue. 240

CAUTION: This preparation must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard. 
Place 56 g (0.5 mol) of finely powdered, fused sodium sulphide and 100 ml 
of rectified spirit in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux 
condenser. To the boiling mixture add 46 g (34 ml, 0.374 mol) of propyl bro- 
mide slowly and reflux for 6 hours. Distil off the ethanol on a water bath, and 
add a large excess of water to the distillate. Separate the upper layer of crude 
sulphide, wash it with three 40-ml portions of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution, then with water until the washings are neutral, and dry over an- 
hydrous calcium chloride or anhydrous calcium sulphate. Distil, and collect 
the dipropyl sulphide at 141-143 °C. The yield is 20g (91%). If the sulphide is 
required perfectly pure, it should be redistilled from a little sodium. 

Cognate preparation. Dibenzyl sulphide. Heat a solution of 63 g (0.5 mol) of

on a rotary evaporator and pour the residue on to 350 g of crushed ice. Separ- 
ate the oil and triturate with a little 70 per cent ethanol to crystallise the prod- 
uct. Recrystallise from the same solvent; the yield of dibenzyl sulphide is 26 g 
(83%), m.p. 49 °C.

aqueous sodium hydroxide. Heat under reflux for 10 minutes and decant the 
hot solution from any insoluble material into a clean conical flask. Allow the 
solution to cool, filter and recrystallise the sulphide twice from methanol. The 
product is obtained as yellow flakes, m.p. 75-76 °C; the yield is 440 mg (35%).

Collect about 750 ml of liquid ammonia (Section 2.17.7, p. 116) in a 1 -litre 
three-necked flask, surrounded by a lagging bath of cork chips and fitted with 
a sealed stirrer unit, a soda-lime guard-tube and a stopper. Weigh out 24 g 
(0.1 mol) of L-cystine (Expt 5.187), and about 10 g (0.48 mol) of sodium cut 
into small pieces under dry light petroleum. Start the stirrer, add about 2 g of 
the sodium followed by L-cystine in small portions until the blue colour has 
disappeared. Repeat this addition sequence until all of the cystine has been 
added and a permanent blue colour remains. Discharge the blue colour by 
gradually adding powdered ammonium chloride, and then add dropwise 
25.3 g (23 ml, 0.2 mol) of benzyl chloride. Remove the stirrer and lagging bath 
and allow the ammonia to evaporate overnight. Dissolve the residue in 
100 ml of cold water and add concentrated hydrochloric acid until the result- 
ing mass is acid to Congo red. Heat the mixture gradually to boiling to dis- 
solve the precipitated product and allow to cool. Filter off the long needles of 
S-benzyl-L-cysteine which separate, wash with a little cold water and allow to 
dry in the air. The yield is 38 g (90%), m.p. 214 °C (decomp.). 



5.17.3 SULPHOXIDES AND SULPHONES 

Dialkyl sulphides may be oxidised to the sulphoxides (4) (alkylsulphinylal- 
kanes), and thence to the sulphones (5) (alkylsulphonylalkanes).

5.17 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Sulphoxides are obtained by using a variety of mild oxidising agents; hydro- 
gen peroxide has been widely used, but aqueous sodium metaperiodate and 
sodium perborate 241 have the advantage of being easily handled reagents. The 
use of the former reagent is described in Expt 5.207. 

More vigorous oxidising agents yield sulphones; an excess of potassium per- 
manganate in aqueous acetic acid is often employed. The preparation of isobutyl 
2,4-dinitropenyl sulphone (Expt 5.208) may be regarded as typical. Frequently 
the vigour of this oxidant (and indeed others such as organic peracids) results in 
other functional groups which may be present in the sulphide (e.g. carbon- 
carbon multiple bonds) being oxidatively degraded. A reagent which is chemo- 
selective for the sulphide to sulphone conversion is potassium hydrogen persul- 
phate. 242 

The simplest sulphoxide, dimethyl sulphoxide, is an important aprotic sol- 
vent (Section 4.1.55, p. 412). Its use as a reagent in carbon-carbon forming reac- 
tions and as a reagent for the oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds 
(p. 608) (the Pfitzner-Moffatt and Swern oxidations) has been extensively 
reviewed/ 4 " An illustrative example of carbon-carbon bond formation using 
dimethyl sulphoxide is noted in Expt 7.3.

45 ml of a 1:1 mixture of water and methanol held at 0°C. Add portionwise 
2.14 g (0.01 mol) of dibenzyl sulphide (Expt 5.204) and continue to stir the 
mixture at °C for several hours, preferably overnight. Extract the reaction 
mixture (which contains precipitated sodium iodate) with three 20 ml por- 
tions of chloroform. Dry the combined chloroform extracts over magnesium 
sulphate and remove the solvent on a rotary evaporator. Recrystallise the 
product from ethanol. The yield of dibenzyl sulphoxide is 2.2 g (96%), m.p. 
135°C.

Dissolve 340 mg of isobutyl 2,4-dinitrophenyl sulphide (Expt 5.205) in 10 ml 
of acetic acid, warm to about 50 °C and add dropwise 8 ml of 3 per cent 
aqueous potassium permanganate solution. Maintain the solution at about 
50 °C for 20 minutes, and then pass through the solution a stream of sulphur 
dioxide to decompose excess potassium permanganate. Add crushed ice to 
the yellow solution to precipitate the crude sulphone. Filter the precipitate, 
dry and recrystallise from rectified spirit to give the yellow crystalline prod- 
uct, m.p. 105-106 °C; the yield is 190 mg (50%). 

5.17.4 0,£DIALKYL DITHIOCARBONATES (XANTHATE ESTERS) 

Alkali metal salts of the O-alkyl dithiocarbonates (e.g. ROCS-S e K®, the 
xanthates) are prepared by the reaction of carbon disulphide with an alcohol 
and an alkali metal hydroxide.

an 0,S-dialkyl dithiocarbonate. 

R'O-CS-S^R 2 -! &gt; R'O-CS-SR 2 + I 

vjrt 

The xanthate esters are of interest in that if the O-alkyl group contains at least 
one a-hydrogen atom, pyrolysis produces an olefin, a thiol and carbon oxysul- 
phide (the Chugaev reaction, Section 5.2.1, p. 489). 

Isolation of the intermediate xanthate salts in the preparation of the xanthate 
esters is not essential. The formation of the latter may be achieved, in one step, 
by converting the alcohol into the corresponding alkoxide by reaction with a 
potassium derivative of a tertiary alcohol (e.g. potassium t-pentoxide), followed 
by reaction successively with carbon disulphide and the alkyl halide. Both pre- 
parative procedures are illustrated in the following section.

Potassium 0-ethyI dithiocarbonate. Into a 500-ml round-bottomed flask, 
fitted with a reflux condenser, place 42 g (0.75 mol) of potassium hydroxide 
pellets and 120g (152 ml) of absolute ethanol. Heat under reflux for 1 hour. 
Allow to cool and decant the liquid from the residual solid into another dry 
500-ml flask; add 57 g (45 ml, 0.75 mol) of carbon disulphide (1) slowly and 
with constant shaking. Filter the resulting almost solid mass, after cooling in 
ice, on a sintered glass funnel at the pump, and wash it with three 25 ml por- 
tions of ether. Dry the potassium O-ethyl dithiocarbonate in a vacuum desic- 
cator over silica gel. The yield is 74 g. If desired, it may be recrystallised from 
absolute ethanol but this is usually unnecessary. 

0-EthyI S-ethyl dithiocarbonate. Place 32 g (0.2 mol) of potassium O-ethyl 
dithiocarbonate and 50 ml of absolute ethanol in a 500-ml round-bottomed 
flask provided with a double surface condenser. Add 32 g (1 6.5 ml, 0.205 mol) 
of ethyl iodide. No reaction appears to take place in the cold. Heat on a water 
bath for 3 hours: a reaction sets in within 15 minutes and the yellow reaction 
mixture becomes white owing to the separation of potassium iodide. Add 
about 150 ml of water, separate the lower layer and wash it with water. Dry it 
with anhydrous calcium chloride or anhydrous calcium sulphate and distil 
collecting O-ethyl S-ethyl dithiocarbonate at 196-198 °C. The yield is 23 g 
(77%). 

Note. (1) Carbon disulphide is toxic and has a dangerously low flash point (Section 
2.3.2, p. 40). 

Cognate preparation. O-Ethyl S-butyl dithiocarbonate. Use 32 g (0.2 mol) of 
potassium O-ethyl dithiocarbonate, 37 g (23 ml, 0.2 mol) of butyl iodide (Expt

into 150 ml of water, saturate with salt (in order to facilitate the separation of 
the upper layer), remove the upper xanthate layer, wash it once with 25 ml of 
saturated salt solution and dry with anhydrous calcium chloride or anhy- 
drous calcium sulphate. Distil under reduced pressure and collect the pale 
yellow O-ethyl S-butyl dithiocarbonate at 90-91 °C/4mmHg. The yield is 
34 g (95%). 

0-[l,2,2-Trimethylpropyl] S-methyl dithiocarbonate. In a 2-litre three-necked 
flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser and dropping funnel, prepare 
potassium t-pentoxide by dissolving 48.5 g (60 ml, 0.55 mol) of 2-methyl- 
butan-2-ol (t-pentyl alcohol) in 750 ml of dry toluene and adding in portions 
21.5 g (0.55 mol) of potassium metal (1) and refluxing gently until reaction is 
complete. Then add 51 g (63 ml, 0.5 mol) of 3,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol to the hot 
solution slowly and with stirring. Cool and add slowly 57 g (0.75 mol) of car- 
bon disulphide. When the reaction has subsided, cool the resulting orange 
xanthate suspension to room temperature, add 78 g (34 ml, 0.55 mol) of 
methyl iodide and heat on a water bath for 4-5 hours. Filter, remove toulene 
and the residual alcohols on a rotary evaporator (fume cupboard) and distil 
the product under reduced pressure collecting the xanthate ester at 85-87 °C/ 
6mmHg (2). The yield is 63 g (70%). 

Note. (1) Great care must be taken in the handling of potassium (see Section 4.2.62, p. 
460) and of methyl iodide (Section 2.3). 

(2) Use a 500-ml flask fitted with a short fractionating column; the distillation is 
accompanied by considerable frothing. 



5.18 UNSATURATED COMPOUNDS 

This section reviews some of the futher important methods of synthesis of (i) 
unsaturated alcohols, (ii) unsaturated carbonyl compounds, and (iii) unsatur- 
ated carboxylic acids. It also provides an opportunity to consider those methods 
which were not conveniently included elsewhere, but which are of great import- 
ance and interest. 

The importance of these three classes of unsaturated compounds is that they 
contain many naturally occurring examples having specific biological activity. 
For this reason their general methods of synthesis are of interest. Furthermore, 
their particular functional features are to be found embedded in the structures of 
more complex acyclic, alicyclic and polycyclic molecules. Thus the incorpora- 
tion of the simpler structures as 'building blocks' in multistage syntheses of, for 
example, antibiotics has been one of the synthetic challenges of recent decades. 

5.18.1 UNSATURATED ALCOHOLS 

The two important groups of unsaturated alcohols are the allylic alcohols [e,g, 
(1)], and the homoallylic alcohols [e.g. (2)]. The (£)-isomers are formulated for 
(1) and (2) but the (Z)-isomers are of course also known; the hydroxyl-carrying 
carbon may also be chiral [(/?)- and (S)-isomers].

ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.18

(I) 

A synthetic survey embracing all these structural and isomeric features cannot 
be attempted here, and the discussion is restricted to the allylic alcohols. 

Retrosynthetic strategies, limited to the more obvious but widely used FGI 
and disconnection transforms in the case of an allylic alcohol target molecule, 
are summarised below. 




RI _c=c e ^ OH 

R 2 



R'-CHO + Me-CO-R 2 



R'-C=CM + R 2 -CHO[ + H] 

The synthetic method (a) is the regioselective reduction of an oe,/?-unsaturated 
aldehyde or ketone (Section 5.18.2, p. 798), which is most conveniently effected 
by the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley procedure (Section 5.4.1, p. 520). The 
further disconnection shown of the oe,/?-carbonyl compound is a refro-aldol con- 
densation (Section 5.18.2, p. 799); however it should be emphasised that other 
routes to the unsaturated carbonyl compound, such as the Horner-Emmons 
reaction (Section 5.18.2, p. 799), may also be feasible. 

Asymmetric reduction of oe,/?-unsaturated carbonyl compounds using chiral 
complexes (Section 5.4.1, p. 521) could feasibly lead to optically active allylic 
alcohols. Other reducing agents which have some merit of regioselectivity, but 
not stereoselectivity, are sodium cyanoborohydride, 244 and sodium boro- 
hydride in the presence of lanthanide salts. 245 

The synthetic method (b) combines the formation of a primary or secondary 
alkynol [from formaldehyde or an aldehyde respectively and an organometallic 
acetylenic reagent (Section 5.4.2, p. 532)] with the semihydrogenation of the 
triple bond to a double bond. As noted in Section 5.2.2, p. 493, appropriate selec- 
tion of catalyst is necessary in the hydrogenation step to ensure the formation of 
either the (£)- or the (Z)-isomer. The specific formation of the allylic alcohol, 
CH 2 =CH-CH(OH)-R, is from a vinylmagnesium halide (Expt 6.41) and an 
aldehyde. 

The synthetic method (c), is a base-catalysed ring opening of an oxirane. 246 
Since the oxirane may be formed by the epoxidation of an olefin (Section 8.1.3, 
p. 1132), or by a methylene insertion reaction into a carbonyl group (Section 
8.1.2, p. 1131), this method is of some versatility.

This reaction is used as one step [(7) to (6)] of the multistage synthesis of the 
monocyclic sesquiterpenic hydrocarbon, dehydro-a-curumene (3) [6-methyl-2- 
(4-methylphenyl)hepta-l,5-diene]. 247 The overall strategy is revealed from a 
retrosynthetic analysis for this compound, and is of interest since it emphasises 
the logic of the disconnection approach and draws together a number of import- 
ant reactions which are relevant to this discussion of unsaturated compounds.

Thus the initial disconnection of (3) reveals the ylide, isopropylidenetriphenyl- 
phosphorane, and the y,&lt;5-unsaturated aldehyde (4) (see the Wittig reaction, 
Sections 5.2.3, p. 495). A refro-Claisen-Cope rearrangement (a [3,3] sigmatropic 
shift, see also the Claisen rearrangement, Section 6.9.2, p. 978) of the aldehyde 
(4) discloses the allyl vinyl ether (5). Disconnection of this ether reveals the 
allylic alcohol and an alkyl vinyl ether. The forward synthetic step [(6) to (5)] is 
a transetherification reaction with ethyl vinyl ether. Reconnection of (6) gives 
the epoxide (7). Various retrosynthetic strategies for epoxides are considered in 
Section 8.1, but the most suitable in the case of (7) is disconnection to p-methyl- 
acetophenone and a carbene insertion reagent. The methodology of the syn- 
thesis of dehydro-a-curumene is formulated in Expt 5.210.

Wittig reaction. To the phosphorane [prepared from isopropyltriphenyl-

5.18.2 UNSATURATED CARBONYL COMPOUNDS 

By far the most important compounds of this type are the oe,/?-unsaturated alde- 
hydes and ketones, of which the simplest general representation is (8) and (9) re- 
spectively. Branching may be present at either or both of the a- or /?- positions as 
for example in 2-ethylhex-2-enal (10) and 4-methylpent-3-en-2-one (11). Com- 
pounds where the carbon-carbon double bond is terminal are acraldehyde [(8), 
R=H], and the alkyl (or aryl) vinyl ketones [(9), R' = H, R = alkyl, aryl etc.]. 




The preparation of oe,/?-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones is exemplified by 
the following four important methods: (a) the oxidation of the corresponding 
unsaturated primary or secondary alcohol; (b) the Horner-Emmons or 
Wadsworth-Emmons modification of the Wittig reaction 248 ; (c) the aldol con- 

798

densation followed by dehydration; and (d) the specific formation of alkyl (or 
aryl) vinyl ketones from Mannich bases. 

THE OXIDATION OF ^-UNSATURATED PRIMARY OR SECOND- 
ARY ALCOHOLS. 

This method is of value when the alcohol is readily available from natural 
sources, or when it can be prepared, for example, by the reaction of an alkenyl- 
organometallic reagent with an aldehyde. An example of the former is the oxida- 
tion of the terpenoid alcohol carveol to carvone (Expt 5.88) using pyridinium 
chlorochromate-on-alumina reagent. 

THE HORNER-EMMONS OR WADSWORTH-EMMONS MODIFICA- 
TION OF THE WITTIG REACTION 

This reaction is discussed in Section 5.2.3, p. 496, where the broad mechanism of 
the reaction and its preparative value is considered. The example included here 
is the preparation of 2-oxoundec-3-ene from octanal and diethyl 2-oxopropane- 
phosphonate, 249 (Expt 5.211). The interest of the procedure is that the reaction 
is carried out under heterogeneous liquid-liquid conditions using a high concen- 
tration of potassium carbonate, but in the absence of an organic solvent and a 
phase transfer catalyst. This may be contrasted with the conditions which 
employ an aprotic solvent and a base such as sodium hydride (cf. Expt 5.17). 

THE ALDOL REACTION FOLLOWED BY DEHYDRATION 

A retrosynthetic analysis of an oe,/?-unsaturated aldehyde or ketone involves an 
initial functional group interconversion into a /Miydroxycarbonyl compound, 
followed by a disconnection into the carbocation (12) and the carbanion (13) 
synthons. The reagent equivalents of these two synthons are the corresponding 
carbonyl compounds.

R 3 



R 2 , R 3 = Horalkyl (|2) (13) 

The forward synthetic reaction is a base-catalysed condensation reaction 
between two carbonyl compounds, the aldol condensation leading to /Miydroxy- 
aldehydes or /Miydroxyketones followed by dehydration. This sequence is one 
of the most important carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, and aldol-type 
condensation reactions are considered in a number of other sections of the text, 
for example, the Doebner reaction (Section 5.18.3, p. 805), the Knoevenagel 
reaction (Section 5.11.6, p. 681), the Perkin reaction (Section 6.12.3, p. 1036) and 
the Robinson annelation reaction (Section 7.2). 

The mechanism is illustrated in the simple case of the self-condensation of an 
aldehyde in the presence of base. Here the nucleophilic, mesomerically stabilised 
a-carbanion (the enolate ion) formed by the action of base, attacks the electro- 
philic carbonyl carbon of a second aldehyde molecule to form, after proton 
exchange with the solvent, the /Miydroxyaldehyde.

All the steps of this reaction are reversible but the position of the equilibrium is 
significantly in favour of the aldol, which generally may be obtained when the 
reaction is carried out at room temperature or below, followed by extraction 
and careful distillation under reduced pressure. When the required product is 
the unsaturated aldehyde the reaction is carried out at a higher temperature, and 
dehydration of the aldol occurs readily (e.g. 2-ethylhex-2-enal, Expt 5.212). In 
the case of aldehydes with only one a-hydrogen atom, aldol formation occurs 
but the resulting /?-hydroxyaldehyde cannot undergo the dehydration step. 

In a similar way a ketone may undergo a self-condensation reaction to give a 
ketol, which may be dehydrated in a separate reaction to an oe,/?-unsaturated 
ketone.

In this case however the position of equilibrium is not in favour of the condensa- 
tion product (which rapidly dissociates into the ketone in the presence of base), 
and a technique has to be employed which continuously removes the ketol prod- 
uct, as it is formed, from the presence of base. A satisfactory procedure for con- 
verting acetone into diacetone alcohol is described in Expt 5.213. The 
dehydration step to give mesityl oxide is subsequently effected by the presence of 
a trace of iodine. 

'Mixed' aldol reactions may be broadly classified as the reaction between two 
different aldehydes or ketones, or the reaction of an aldehyde with a ketone. 
Apart from the concomitant self-condensation, not less than two possible 
'crossed' products can be envisaged. Such reactions are therefore only prepara- 
tively useful either if appropriate structural conditions are present, or if certain 
experimental conditions are used to effect a directed aldol condensation. 

In the former instance, the major structural condition is that one of the car- 
bonyl components (either the aldehyde or the ketone) has no a-hydrogen and 
thus is unable to form an enolate ion, but is nevertheless sufficiently electrophilic 
at its carbonyl carbon that it reacts with the carbanion of the second carbonyl 
component. Examples are provided in the formation of 4-phenylbut-3-en-2-one 
from benzaldehyde (no a-hydrogens) and acetone in the presence of base, and 
the formation of benzylideneacetophenone from benzaldehyde and acetophe- 
none (Expt 6.135). 

Recent decades have seen the enormous development of a great range of pro- 
cedures for the achievement of directed self- or cross-coupling reactions. The 
interested reader should consult the relevant review articles which cover the field 
comprehensively. 250 One example is used here to illustrate, in part, the com- 



800 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.11 



plexity and interest of these reactions. This is the reaction between cyclo- 
hexanone and benzaldehyde where a conventional aldol-type reaction is 
unlikely to be successful owing to the low concentration of carbanions arising 
from the ketone. However, if the cyclohexanone is first converted into the cor- 
responding silyl enol ether (14), and then treated with the aldehyde in the pres- 
ence of titanium chloride, the reaction gives a chelated titanium complex of 2- 
(l'-hydroxybenzyl)cyclohexanone (15); hydrolysis with water gives the aldol 251 
(16) (Expt 5.214).

(16) 

The stereoisomeric features of the intermediates and of the product of this reac- 
tion should be noted. Thus the silyl enol ether (14) can only have the (£)- 
configuration. The product (16) has two chiral sites (*) and the aldol is therefore 
a mixture of erythro/threo ketols; in this case the ratio is 23:69. 

It should be noted that several procedures are available for the preparation of 
l-(trimethylsilyloxy)cyclohexene. In an original report 252 it was prepared by 
heating a dimethylformamide solution of cyclohexanone under reflux with 
chlorotrimethylsilane in the presence of triethylamine. This procedure is gener- 
ally satisfactory for aldehydes and symmetrical ketones, or ketones which can 
enolise in one direction only. The method described in Expt 5.214 employs lith- 
ium sulphide as an additive to increase the silylating power of the chlorotri- 
methylsilane, so that the reaction proceeds at room temperature; acetonitrile is 
used as the solvent. 253 



THE MANNICH REACTION 

The mechanism of the reaction is considered in Section 6.12.7, p. 1050, where 
acetophenone, which can only enolise in one direction, reacts with the formalde- 
hyde equivalent (17) formed from formaldehyde and dimethylamine hydro- 
chloride, to give the Mannich base (18), which in this case is isolated as the 
hydrochloride. The free Mannich bases are obtained by treatment with base and 
solvent extraction or crystallisation (e.g. gramine, Expt 6.147).

Conversion of a Mannich base hydrochloride into an oe,/?-unsaturated carbonyl 
compound, is illustrated by the formation of phenyl vinyl ketone, which is 
obtained directly by steam distillation (Expt 6.147). Alternatively the Mannich 
base may be treated with methyl iodide to form the quaternary salt, which then 
gives the oe,/?-unsaturated carbonyl compound by a base-catalysed elimination 
reaction.

(264 ml, 3.0 mol) of redistilled butyraldehyde (compare Expt 5.74). With 
vigorous stirring, add the butyraldehyde as rapidly as the efficiency of the

4-MethyI-4-hydroxypentan-2-one (diacetone alcohol). Fit a 1 -litre round- 
bottomed flask with a large Soxhlet extractor (Fig. 2.96) and attach an effi- 
cient double surface condenser to the latter. Place 595 g (750 ml, 10.25 mol) of 
commercial acetone, preferably dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, 
and a few fragments of porous porcelain in the flask. Select as large a Soxhlet 
thimble as the extractor will accommodate and three-quarters fill it with bar- 
ium hydroxide (1). Fill the remaining space in the thimble with glass wool. 
Insert the charged thimble into the extractor. Heat the flask on a water bath 
or steam bath so that the acetone refluxes back into the extractor rather 
rapidly. Continue the heating until the acetone no longer refluxes when the

flask is almost completely immersed in the boiling water bath (72-120 hours). 
The refluxing may be interrupted at any time for as long as desired without 
influencing the preparation. Equip the flask with a fractionating column 
attached to an efficient double surface condenser set for downward distilla- 
tion. Immerse the flask in an oil bath and raise the temperature gradually to 
125 °C; maintain this temperature as long as acetone distils over. The re- 
covery of acetone is complete when the temperature at the top of the column 
is about 70 °C. Distil the residue (2) under diminished pressure (3); a little 
acetone passes over first, followed by the diacetone alcohol at 71-74 °C/ 
23mmHg (or 62-64°C/13mmHg). The yield is 450 g (75%). 

Mesityl oxide. Fit a 750-ml round-bottomed flask with a fractionating col- 
umn attached to a condenser set for downward distillation. Place 400 g 
(3.44 mol) of diacetone alcohol (the crude product is quite satisfactory), 0.1 g 
of iodine and a few fragments of porous porcelain in the flask. Distil slowly 
with a small free flame (best in an air bath) and collect the following fractions: 
(a) 56-80 °C (acetone and a little mesityl oxide); (b) 80-126 °C (two layers, 
water and mesityl oxide); and (c) 126-131 °C, which is almost pure mesityl 
oxide. Separate the water from fraction (b), dry with anhydrous potassium 
carbonate or anhydrous sodium sulphate and fractionate from a small flask. 
A further quantity of mesityl oxide is thus obtained. The total yield is about 
320 g (95%). 

Notes. (1) If crystallised barium hydroxide [Ba(OH) 2 ,8H 2 0] is employed, this 
becomes dehydrated after one run; the anhydrous compound is just as satisfactory 
and may be used repeatedly. 

(2) The residual liquid contains about 95 per cent of diacetone alcohol and is satisfac- 
tory for the preparation of mesityl oxide. 

(3) Diacetone alcohol partially decomposes when distilled under normal pressure.

sulphide (1.5 g, 30mmol) (1) in dry acetonitrile (25 ml) in a 100-ml round- 
bottomed flask, fitted with a water condenser and a nitrogen inlet, is added

none (1.96 g, 20 mmol) and triethylamine (3 ml, 20 mmol) in succession, and 
the solution is allowed to stir at room temperature (25 °C). The progress of 
the reaction is monitored by removing aliquots periodically and analysing 
them after work-up by t.l.c. (silica gel plates with hexane as an eluant). Soon 
after the completion of the reaction (c. 16 hours), the mixture is taken up in 
ether (50 ml) and washed thoroughly with ice-cold aqueous 5 per cent hydro- 
chloric acid solution (4 x 50 ml) to remove all basic and water-soluble mater- 
ials. The ethereal extract is washed with ice-cold aqueous 5 per cent sodium

2.75 mmol) and titanium(iv) chloride (0.55 g, 2.75 mmol) (2) in dry dichloro- 
methane (20 ml) under an argon atmosphere at — 78 °C, and the reaction 
mixture is stirred for 1 hour. After hydrolysis (with water) at that tempera- 
ture, the resulting organic layer is extracted with ether, and the extract is 
washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The extract is 
evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue is purified by column 
chromatography (silica gel). Elution with dichoromethane affords 115mg 
(23%) of eryf/iro-2-(r-hydroxybenzyl)cyclohexanone, m.p. 103 °C (recrystal- 
lised from propan-2-ol, m.p. 103.5-104.5 °C); i.r. 3530 (OH), 1700 (C=0)

From the last fraction, 346 mg (69%) of f/ieo-2-(l'-hydroxybenzyl)cyclo-

(CAUTION). 

5.18.3 UNSATURATED ACIDS AND ESTERS 

As for the unsaturated carbonyl compounds, the most significant groups are the 
oe,/?-unsaturated acids or esters. Some of their methods of formation are closely 
analogous, for example, (a) the Horner-Emmons or Wadsworth-Emmons reac- 
tion, and (b) the aldol-type reactions. Rather more specific methods are con- 
sidered below for the formation of oe,/?-acetylenic acids, and for the conversion of 
the unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, maleic acid, into its anhydride or into fumaric 
acid. 

THE HORNER-EMMONS OR WADSWORTH-EMMONS REACTION 

This reaction is considered in Sections 5.2.3, p. 496, and 5.18.2, p. 799, and the 
specific examples that are included in this section are: (i) the formation of ethyl 
cyclohexylideneacetate from cyclohexanone and triethyl phosphonoacetate in 
the solvent 1,2-dimethoxyethane and using sodium hydride as the base for the 
formation of the phosphoryl-stabilised anion; 254 and (ii) the formation of ethyl 
(E)-but-2-enoate from acetaldehyde and triethyl phosphonoacetate under PTC 
conditions 255 (Expt 5.215). In the latter example the (£)-configuration is to be 
expected from the general features of the reaction that are summarised in 
Section 5.2.3, p. 496. 



804 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.18 



THE ALDOL-TYPE REACTIONS 

This reaction type leading to oe,/?-unsaturated acids and esters is exemplified in 
the Perkin reaction (Section 6.12.3, p. 1036) and the Knoevenagel reaction 
(Section 5.1 1.6, p. 681). The Doebner reaction, which is illustrated in this section, 
is the condensation of an aldehyde with malonic acid in pyridine solution, often 
in the presence of a trace of piperidine. The reaction mechanism involves the 
addition of a malonate anion to the aldehydic carbonyl carbon atom followed 
by the elimination of water accompanied by decarboxylation.

Examples given in Expt 5.216 include the preparation of non-2-enoic acid start- 
ing from hexanal, but-2-enoic acid (crotonic acid) from acetaldehyde, and also 
hexa-2,4-dienoic acid (sorbic acid) starting from the conjugated aldehyde 
crotonaldehyde. 

MISCELLANEOUS METHODS 

A useful route to oe,/?-acetylenic acids, illustrated by the preparation of but-2- 
ynoic acid (Expt 5.217), involves the base-induced decomposition of the 
dibromopyrazolone which is obtained by brominating pyrazol-5-one, which is 
itself prepared by the reaction of a /?-keto ester with hydrazine.

If the bromination of the pyrazol-5-one is interrupted when only one of the 
methylenic hydrogens has been substituted, and the monobromopyrazol-5-one 
is similarly treated with alkali, the oe,/?-ethylenic acid is obtained. 

The simplest unsaturated dicarboxylic acids are maleic acid and fumaric acid, 
both of which are cheap, commercially available, materials. They are geometric 
isomers; maleic acid is the (Z) isomer (19), and fumaric acid is the (£) isomer 
(20). Maleic acid forms an internal anhydride, maleic anhydride (21), which is 
widely used to form adducts with conjugated dienes (the Diels-Alder reaction, 
Section 7.6). The formation of the anhydride from maleic acid and the conver- 
sion of maleic acid into fumaric acid are described in Expt 5.218. The hydro- 
genation of maleic acid to succinic acid is of value as a means of evaluating the 
activity of a catalyst for use in hydrogenations at atmospheric pressure; the ex- 
perimental procedure is given in Section 2.17.1, p. 87.

CAUTION: Hydrogen gas is evolved in the first part of this experiment, hence 
the apparatus should be sited in an efficient fume-cupboard. 

Triethyl phosphonoacetate (1 1.2 g, 0.05 mol) is added dropwise at 20 °C to 
a slurry of 50 per cent sodium hydride (2.4 g, 0.05 mol) in 100 ml of dry 1,2-

at room temperature until gas evolution has ceased. Cyclohexanone (4.9 g, 
0.05 mol) is added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature is maintained 
below 30 °C. After the addition, the solution is stirred for 15 minutes at room 
temperature during which time a viscous semi-solid appears. The mixture is 
taken up in a large excess of water, and the aqueous solution extracted with 
ether. The ether layer, after being dried over magnesium sulphate and evapor- 
ated, gives a liquid residue, b.p. 88-90 °C/10mmHg, 5.8 g (70%), n£ 5 1.4704.

and tetrabutylammonium iodide (0.7 g) (1). The strongly exothermic reaction 
is complete in 15 minutes. The organic layer is separated, washed with water 
(5 ml), and dried with magnesium sulphate. Evaporation of the solvent and 
distillation of the residue affords the product, b.p. 51-52 °C/25mmHg, in 54 
per cent yield. 

Note. To avoid undesirable reactions of the aldol-type, both substrates should be 
added simultaneously to the reaction mixture.

(0.57 mol) of dry, powdered malonic acid in 67 g (68.5 ml, 0.85 mol) of dry 
pyridine to which 0.5 ml of piperidine has been added. Leave in an ice chest or 
refrigerator for 24 hours. Warm the mixture on a steam bath until the evolu- 
tion of carbon dioxide ceases. Cool in ice, add 60 ml of 1:1 sulphuric acid (by 
volume) and leave in the ice bath for 3-4 hours. Collect the crude crotonic 
acid (c. 27 g) which has separated by suction filtration. Extract the mother- 
liquor with three 25 ml portions of ether, dry the ethereal extract, and evapor- 
ate the ether; the residual crude acid weighs 6g. Recrystallise from light 
petroleum, b.p. 60-80 °C; the yield of crude crotonic acid, m.p. 72 °C, is 20 g 
(41%). 

Sorbic acid (Hexa-2,4-dienoic acid). Place 40 g (46.5 ml, 0.57 mol) of croton- 
aldehyde (b.p. 101-103 °C), 60 g (0.575 mol) of malonic acid and 60 g (61 ml, 
0.76 mol) of dry pyridine (b.p. 113-115 °C) in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask, 
attach a reflux condenser and heat on a water bath for 3 hours. At the end of 
this period the vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide will have ceased. Cool 
the mixture in ice and cautiously acidify it by the addition of a solution of 
21.3 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid in 50 ml of water with shaking. Most of 
the sorbic acid separates out immediately; a more complete separation is 
obtained by cooling the solution in ice for 3-4 hours. Filter the acid at the 
pump and wash it with a little ice-cold water. Recrystallise from about 125 ml 
of boiling water; the maximum recovery of purified acid is achieved by leav- 
ing the solution in an ice chest or a refrigerator overnight and then filtering. 
The yield of sorbic acid, m.p. 134°C, is 20 g (31%).

After further stirring for 1 hour at room temperature, cool the reaction mix- 
ture in an ice bath to complete the crystallisation, and filter. Wash the prod- 
uct with ice-cold ethanol; it is then pure enough for use in the next stage. The

4,4-Dibromo-3-methyIpyrazoI-5-one. Dissolve 20.0 g (0.2 mol) of 3-methyl- 
pyrazol-5-one in 80 ml of glacial acetic acid and stir magnetically during the 
slow dropwise addition of a solution of 32 g (0.2 mol) of bromine in 20 ml of 
glacial acetic acid (1). On completion of this addition, add 50 ml of water and 
continue the dropwise addition of a further 32 g (0.2 mol) of bromine dis- 
solved in 20 ml of glacial acetic acid. On completion of this second addition of 
bromine solution allow the mixture to stand at room temperature overnight. 
Add water to precipitate the dibromopyrazolone, filter and wash the solid 
product under suction with distilled water until the washings are neutral. The 
air-dried product, sufficiently pure for use in the next statge, has m.p. 130— 
132 °C, the yield is 41 g (79%). 

But-2-ynoic acid. Prepare a solution of 20 g of sodium hydroxide in 500 ml of 
water and stir magnetically in an ice bath until the temperature reaches 0- 
5°C. Add portion wise over 10 minutes 34 g (0.1 32 mol) of 4,4-dibromo-3- 
methylpyrazol-5-one. The bromoketone dissolves to give an orange-red solu- 
tion which evolves nitrogen gas; the temperature of the solution during the 
addition shows only a slight tendency to rise. Stir the reaction mixture for 
1 hour at 0-5 °C and then at room temperature for 1 hour. Cool the solution 
again and acidify it with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Continuously 
extract the acidified solution with ether overnight (Section 2.22), dry the 
ethereal extract with magnesium sulphate and remove the solvent on a rotary 
evaporator. Place the flask containing the orange oil in a vacuum desiccator 
and allow to stand until it solidifies. Extract the orange crystalline deposit 
with successive portions of boiling light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) and con- 
centrate the combined extracts to about 50 ml. Filter the slightly off-white 
product, m.p. 74-75 °C; recrystallise by dissolving in the minimum volume of 
light petroleum (b.p. 80-100 °C), adding an equal volume of light petroleum 
(b.p. 40-60 °C) and allowing to cool. The pure but-2-ynoic acid has m.p. 75- 
76 °C, the yield is 5.9 g (54%). The i.r. spectrum shows absorption at 2950 
(broad, —OH), 2240 (sharp, disubstituted — C=C— ), 1690 cm" 1 (broad, 
— 0=0 in carboxylic acid). 

Note. (1) Removal of a portion of the reaction mixture when 1 mol of bromine has 
been added and addition to it of water results in the precipitation of the monobromo

and a condenser set for downward distillation. Heat the mixture on an air 
bath; when the temperature reaches 150°C, 75 ml of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane 
and between 15 and 15.5 ml of water are present in the receiver. Continue the 
distillation using an air condenser and change the receiver flask when the 
temperature reaches 190 °C. Collect the maleic anhydride at 195-197 °C. 
Recrystallise the crude anhydride from chloroform. The yield of pure maleic 
anhydride, m.p. 54 °C, is 70 g (83%). 

5.19 RESOLUTION OF RACEMATES 

The development of the various strategies for the synthesis of optically active 
compounds in high enantiomeric excess has made great advances over the last 
decade or so (p. 15). Nevertheless, resolution is still necessary to prepare optic- 
ally pure chiral auxiliaries, to purify products of low enantiomeric excess and as 
a valid strategy for chiral synthesis in its own right. The most important general 
procedure for such resolutions, originally proposed and explored by Pasteur, in- 
volves the conversion of the mixture of enantiomers into a pair of diastereo- 
isomeric derivatives by reaction with a pure, optically active, reagent, e.g. 

2(±)-X + 2( + )-Y &gt; ( + )-X( + )-Y + (-)-X( + )-Y 

(1) (2) (3) 

It should be recalled that whereas the enantiomers in the mixture (or racemate) 
(1) have identical physical properties (except for their action on the plane of 
polarised light), the diastereoisomers (2) and (3) have physical properties (e.g. 
solubility, boiling points, chromatographic behaviour, etc.) which are frequently 
significantly different. Resolution of the mixture (or racemate) can then be 
achieved provided that one of the diastereoisomers may be obtained in a pure 
state, and that regeneration from it of the pure enantiomorphous form is not 
accompanied by any degree of racemisation. 

Pasteur's original chemical method of resolution, which is still widely used at 
the present time, involves the formation of diastereoisomeric salts from racemic 
acids or bases by neutralisation with available optically pure bases or acids re- 
spectively. The required optically pure reactants are often available from natural 
sources and include tartaric, malic and mandelic acids, and alkaloids such as 
brucine, strychnine, morphine and quinine. Ideally, by appropriate choice of the 
resolving reagent, the diastereoisomeric salts are crystalline and have solubilities 
sufficiently different to permit the separation and ready purification of the less 
soluble salt by fractional crystallisation from a suitable solvent. The regenera- 
tion of the optically pure enantiomorph, and incidentally the recovery of the 
resolving reagent, normally presents no problems. 

809 



5.19 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The procedure is illustrated in Expt 5.219 by the resolution of ( ± )-a-methyl- 
benzylamine (1-phenylethylamine) with the aid of tartaric acid. 

The Pasteur method can also be applied to the resolution of neutral 
racemates, if these can be first converted into an acidic or basic derivative from 
which eventually a mixture of crystalline diastereoisomeric salts may be pre- 
pared by appropriate neutralisation. Thus, a racemic alcohol (e.g. (±)-octan-2- 
ol, Expt 5.220) may be converted into the corresponding racemic hydrogen 
phthalate ester by heating with phthalic anhydride, and the ester is then resolved 
by the Pasteur procedure using an optically active base. The resulting optically 
active hydrogen phthalate ester is then carefully hydrolysed with aqueous 
sodium hydroxide to regenerate one of the optically active forms of the alcohol.

A racemic aldehyde or ketone may similarly be resolved by conversion into a 
diastereoisomeric mixture of hydrazones (or semicarbazones) using, for 
example, the optically active 1-phenylethylhydrazine. 256 

The most important development in the last decade for the resolution of mix- 
tures of enantiomers is in the application of g.l.c. and h.p.l.c. techniques. These 
techniques have been used in the analytical mode to determine the ratio of enan- 
tiomers, for example in the case of products arising from an asymmetric syn- 
thesis. Indeed this method of analysis has several advantages over the 
conventional procedure of optical rotation measurement and comparison with 
the maximum known rotation of one of the pure enantiomers (p. 34). Thus the 
analysis is rapid and is feasible on quantities of sample which would be in- 
adequate for measurement of optical rotation. These chromatographic methods 
may also be used in the preparative mode for the realistic isolation of the pure 
enantiomers. Furthermore, by a close study of the chromatographic behaviour 
(i.e. elution times) of a series of enantiomeric pairs of compounds having like 
functionality and known configurations, some judgement is possible for the 
assignment of configuration to a similar member of the series but of unknown 
configuration. 



810 



ALIPHATIC COMPOUNDS 5.19 



Both techniques can be applied in two ways. In the first method the enantio- 
meric mixture (or racemate) is converted into a diastereoisomeric mixture with a 
suitable optically pure reagent, and this mixture chromatographed on a column 
having an achiral stationary phase. Separation then depends on the differential 
molecular interactions of the diastereoisomers with the stationary phase. In the 
second method, the stationary phase on the support material (usually chemi- 
cally bonded) contains a chiral, optically pure residue. In this case the mixture of 
enantiomers which is loaded directly on to the column is separated by virtue of 
differential diastereoisomeric molecular interactions between each enantiomer 
and the optically pure stationary phase. 

Research in this area of resolution methods was first in g.l.c. However, the 
need to derivatise many of the compounds of interest to make them sufficiently 
volatile for analysis tended to increase the complexity of sample preparation. 
High performance liquid chromatography does not have this drawback (p. 232) 
and research activity in this field is now extensive. One illustrative example of 
the elegance of this technique is noted here 257 but the reader's attention is 
directed to an excellent summary to 1983 of both these chromatographic 
methods. 258 

A commercially packed h.p.l.c. column (25 cm x 4.6 mm) of y-aminopropyl

(Dupont Co.), or 10 /im Lithosorb (Merck), or 5^m irregular (J. T. Baker 
Chemical Co.)] was sequentially treated, at a pumping rate of 2 ml/min, with the 
following solutions: 2 ml of triethylamine in 40 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran, 2g of 
(/?)-JV-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylglycine in 40 ml of dry tetrahydrofuran, 20 ml 
of dry tetrahydrofuran, and finally 10 per cent propan-2-ol in hexane, until the 
base line stabilises. The chiral amino acid derivative (which is available from 
Aldrich Chemical Co.) becomes ionically bonded to the amino residues on the 
stationary phase.

This chiral column has been shown successfully to resolve enantiomeric mix- 
tures (or racemates) of aromatic alcohols including l,l'-bi-2-naphthol and its 
analogues (p. 836), aromatic hydroxy (or alkoxy) carboxylic esters and amides, 
amino acid derivatives, sulphoxides, cyclic imides and amides, lactones, etc. 
Even this list should not be regarded as limiting. The potential of this method, 
coupled with the simplicity of operation will undoubtedly be extensively de- 
veloped and explored in the coming years. 

Other chiral immobilised stationary phases are available commercially, for 
example covalently bonded bovine serum albumin or chemically bonded l- 
hydroxyproline-Cu 2 ® complexes to wide-bore Nucleosil (both from Macherey- 
Nagel). 

Several useful methods of resolution, which are particularly applicable to the 
a-amino acids, involve the use of enzymes. Their success depends upon the fact 
that enzyme-catalysed reactions are stereospecific, only one of the enantio- 
morphous forms (actually the form having the 'natural', l, configuration) taking 

811 



5.19 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



part in the reaction. For example, the conversion of an acyl-L-amino acid (best 
results are usually obtained with the benzoyl derivative) into the corresponding 
anilide by reaction with aniline in a buffered medium* is catalysed by the 
enzyme papain which occurs in papaya latex. Therefore, if the racemic acyl- 
amino acid is used, only the L-form is converted into the neutral anilide which 
can be readily separated from the unreacted acidic D-form.

This method represents a resolution by asymmetric enzymic synthesis (e.g. l-

( — )-a-Methy!benzyIamine. Add 450 ml of methanol to 31.5 g (0.21 mol) of 
( + )-tartaric acid in a 1 -litre conical flask and heat the mixture almost to boil- 
ing on a water bath. Then add cautiously with swirling 24.2 g (0.20 mol) of 
( + )-a-methylbenzylamine (Expt 5.197); too rapid an addition may cause the 
mixture to boil over. Allow the mixture to cool to room temperature and then 
to stand for 24 hours to allow slow separation of the ( — )-amine-( + )- 
hydrogen tartrate as prismatic crystals (1). Filter off the product (17.9 g); con- 
centrate the filtrate to 225 ml under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator 
and allow it to stand at room temperature for 24 hours to obtain a second 
crop. The total yield of the ( — )-amine-( + )-hydrogen tartrate is about 21 g 
(77%). 

Shake the total product with 90 ml of water in a 250-ml separating funnel 
and basify the mixture by cautiously adding 50 per cent aqueous sodium

184-1 86 °C; the yield is about 5g (53%). Measure the optical rotation of the 
neat liquid and calculate the specific rotation (Section 2.36). Pure ( — )-&lt;x-

( + )-a-Methy!benzyIamine. This enantiomer may be recovered using the 
following procedure. Evaporate the methanolic filtrate from the isolation of 
the ( — )-amine salt to dryness using a rotary evaporator. Convert the residual 
salt to the free amine by treatment with sodium hydroxide solution followed 
by ether extraction as described above. Do not distil the recovered amine but 
remove the last traces of ether completely by warming under reduced pres- 
sure. Weigh the resulting product (x g), measure its optical rotation and cal- 
culate the specific rotation. The ratio of this value to that of pure ( + )-amine 
is the optical purity of the sample; the weight of ( + )-amine in the sample in 
excess of that present in the racemic modification is given by: 

, . . xx observed [a] D for neat liquid 
excess ( + )-amine = ~^~ — grams 

For each gram of excess ( + )-amine present add firstly 10.0 ml of rectified 
spirit, bring to the boil and then add, for each gram, a hot solution of 0.44 g of 
98 per cent sulphuric acid (1.03 times the theoretical amount) in 21.5 ml of 
rectified spirit. Allow the solution to cool slowly to room temperature, filter 
off the crystalline ( + )-amine sulphate and wash it with cold rectified spirit. 
The yield is about 1 g of sulphate per gram of ( + )-amine (71%). Liberate the 
free ( + )-amine from the sulphate as described for the ( — )-amine from the 
tartrate, but use 4 ml of water and 0.5 ml of 50 per cent aqueous sodium 
hydroxide for each gram of sulphate. The yield of ( + )-amine, b.p. 184— 
186°C, is 60 per cent of theory; its optical purity is 95 per cent. 

Notes. (1) If fine needles separate, the mixture should be warmed until they re- 
dissolve, and the solution allowed to cool. The solution should be seeded with the 
prismatic crystals if these are available. 

(2) The free amine rapidly absorbs carbon dioxide. It is therefore essential to protect 
the distillation apparatus from the atmosphere with a guard-tube filled with soda- 
lime. As the product tends to foam excessively during distillation, the apparatus used 
should be larger than is customary for the volume of liquid to be distilled. 

Experiment 5.220 RESOLUTION OF (±)-OCTAN-2-OL* 

Heat a mixture of 65 g (0.5 mol) of dry octan-2-ol (b.p. 178-180°C), 74 g 
(0. 5 mol) of pure phthalic anhydride ( 1 ) and 40 g of dry pyridine (CAUTION) 
on a water bath for 1 hour, and allow to cool. Dissolve the resulting viscous 
mass in an equal volume of acetone. Add slowly, preferably with stirring, 
55 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid diluted with an approximately equal 
volume of crushed ice: if an oil separates before all the hydrochloric acid has 
been added, introduce more acetone to render the mixture homogeneous. 
Add ice-water until the oil is completely precipitated; this usually sets to a 
hard mass within 1-2 hours. If the resulting mass is semi-solid or pasty (2),

transfer it to a large flask and pass steam through it until the octan-2-one is 
removed, i.e. until the steam distillate is clear; pour the contents of the flask 
while still warm into a beaker. The (±)-2-octyl hydrogen phthalate solidifies 
on cooling. Filter the octyl hydrogen phthalate at the pump, wash it with 
water, grind it thoroughly in a mortar with water, filter again and dry in the 
air. The crude material is quite satisfactory for the subsequent resolution (3). 

Introduce 197 g (0.5 mol) of anhydrous brucine (CAUTION: poisonous) 
or 215 g of the air-dried dihydrate (4) into a warm solution of 139 g of (±)-2- 
octyl hydrogen phthalate in 300 ml of acetone and warm the mixture under 
reflux on a water bath until the solution is clear. Upon cooling, the brucine 
salt [( + )-A, ( — )-B] separates as a crystalline solid. Filter this off on a sin- 
tered glass funnel, press it well to remove mother-liquor and wash it in the 
funnel with 1 23 ml of acetone. Set the combined filtrate and washings (W) 
aside. Cover the crystals with acetone and add, slowly and with stirring, a 
slight excess (to Congo red) of dilute hydrochloric acid (1:1 by volume; about 
60 ml); if the solution becomes turbid before the introduction of the acid is 
complete, add more acetone to produce a clear liquid. Add ice-water until the 
precipitation of the active 2-octyl hydrogen phthalate [crude ( + )-A] is com- 
plete; filter (5), wash with cold water and dry in the air. The yield is about half 
that of the (±)-ester originally taken (6). 

Concentrate the combined filtrate and washings (W) to about half the 
original volume, and pour it into slightly more than the calculated amount of 
dilute hydrochloric acid (use a mixture of 30 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid and 30 ml of ice-water); then add about 300 ml of water. Collect the 
active 2-octyl hydrogen phthalate (crude( — )-A) as above (5). The weight of 
the air-dried ester is about half that of the (±)-ester originally used (7). 

Crystallise the two lots of crude active 2-octyl hydrogen phthalates separ- 
ately twice from 90 per cent acetic acid; use 2 g of acetic acid to each gram of 
solid. The recrystallised esters, if optically pure (8), will melt sharply at 75 °C; 
if the melting points are below 75 °C, further recrystallisation is necessary. 
The yields of optically pure products, m.p. 75 °C, are 48 g and 49 g respect- 
ively. 

To obtain optically pure ( + )- and ( — )-octan-2-ol, steam distil the respect- 
ive esters with 30 per cent sodium hydroxide solution; use the proportions 
1 mol of ester to 2 mols of sodium hydroxide. Separate the alcohols from the 
steam distillate, dry over anhydrous potassium carbonate and distil under 
diminished pressure. Both samples boil at 86 °C/20 mmHg (9) and have the 
following rotations: 

[aU 7 °+9.9°, [a]U° 6l +11.8°; [a]i 7 ° -9.9°, [a]U°6, -11.8°. 

The yields from the 2-octyl hydrogen phthalates are almost quantitative. 

Notes. (1) If the presence of phthalic acid is suspected, it may be readily removed by 
mixing with cold chloroform; phthalic anhydride dissolves readily, but the acid is in- 
soluble. 

(2) This is due to octan-2-one in the original octan-2-ol; it is most easily separated by 
steam distillation as described. 

(3) The inactive 2-octyl hydrogen phthalate may be recrystallised from light petro- 
leum, b.p. 60-80 °C, or from glacial acetic acid, and then melts at 55 °C. If the octan-2- 
ol is pure, the yield of pure material is almost quantitative.

(4) Commercial brucine is usually the tetrahydrate C 2 3H2604N2,4H 2 0; upon air dry- 
ing, this loses two molecules of water of crystallisation and passes into the dihydrate. 

(5) The filtrates from the decomposition of the brucine salts with dilute hydrochloride 
acid should be carefully preserved. The brucine is recovered by the addition of an 
excess of dilute ammonia solution (1:4); if the solution becomes turbid before all the 
ammonia solution is added, introduce a little ethanol until the solution becomes clear. 
After several hours in an open beaker, filter off the brucine, wash it well with cold 
water and dry it in the air. 

(6) The rotation in absolute ethanol is about [oe] D +44°, [a] 546 | +47°. 

(7) The rotation in absolute ethanol is about [a] D —44°, [a] 546 | -47°. 

(8) The optically pure esters have rotations in ethanol of [a] D —48.4°, [a] 5461 —58.5°, 
and [a] D +48.4°, [a] 5461 +58.5° respectively. A preliminary check of the optical 
purity is, however, more simply made by a m.p. determination; the rotation is deter- 
mined, if desired, when the m.p. is 75 °C. 

(9) The boiling point under atmospheric pressure is 179 °C. 

Experiment 5.221 RESOLUTION OF dl-ALANINE 
Benzoyl dl -alanine. Dissolve lOOg (1.1 mol) of DL-alanine (Expt 5.180) in 
400 ml of water containing 44.5 g (1.1 mol) of sodium hydroxide and cool the 
solution in an ice bath. Add 1 75 g (1.2 mol) of benzoyl chloride and a solution 
of 49 g (1.2 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 200 ml of water to the stirred, cooled, 
amino acid solution, alternately and in portions during 2 hours; continue to 
stir for a further 2-hour period. Boil the reaction mixture with 10 g of de- 
colourising charcoal, filter, cool the clear yellow filtrate to °C and acidify 
carefully to Congo red with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Triturate a por- 
tion of the oil which separates with water to induce crystallisation and then 
seed the bulk of the acidified solution with crystals and leave in an ice bath to 
complete the crystallisation process. Filter off the product, wash the filter 
cake with 500 ml of ice-cold water and recrystallise from about 3.5 litres of 
boiling water. The yield of benzoyl-DL-alanine, m.p. 162-164 °C, is 194.5 g 
(90%). 

Benzoyl-L-alanine anilide. Use freshly boiled, cooled, distilled water through- 
out this stage. Prepare an 0.1 m citrate buffer solution by dissolving 48 g of an- 
hydrous citric acid and 16.5 g of sodium hydroxide in 2.5 litres of water. Stir 
together 50 g of technical powdered papain (1) and 4g of potassium cyanide 
in 500 ml of the buffer solution, adjust the pH to 5 (narrow range pH paper) 
with glacial acetic acid, and stir for a further 75 minutes. Filter this enzyme 
extract through a Celite filter bed. Dissolve 193 g (1 mol) of benzoyl-DL- 
alanine by warming it in 300 ml of the citrate buffer to which has been added 
120 ml of 2.5 molar sodium hydroxide, 360 ml of 3 m sodium acetate solution 
and 93 g (91 ml, 1 mol) of redistilled aniline; adjust the pH of this solution to 5 
with sodium hydroxide solution. Cool the solution to 45 °C, add the filtered 
enzyme extract and transfer the mixture to several conical flasks of suitable 
size such that each is filled to the neck and tightly stoppered with a rubber 
bung to exclude air. Leave the flasks in an incubator held at 37 °C, shaking 
them occasionally during the early stages. 

Product begins to separate within 5 minutes and the contents of the flasks 
becomes almost immobile within 2 hours. After 24 hours filter the mixture 
and return the filtrate to the incubator for a further 24 hours and remove the 
additional crop of solid which separates. Wash the combined solids with

250 ml of water and recrystallise from 1 litre of 50 per cent aqueous ethanol 
with the aid of decolourising charcoal. The yield of benzoyl-L-alanine anilide 
is 122g (91%), m.p. 175-176 °C, [a]&amp;° -7.8° (c5 in Me-C0 2 H). 

[-Alanine. Heat a mixture of 50 g (0.187 mol) of benzoyl-L-alanine anilide 
and 250 ml of 6 m hydrochloric acid under reflux for 5 hours. Leave the mix- 
ture at room temperature overnight, remove the precipitated benzoic acid by 
filtration and evaporate the filtrate to dryness under reduced pressure (rotary 
evaporator). Dissolve the brown oily residue in 100 ml of water and boil it 
with decolourising charcoal. Filter and pass the filtrate through 450 g of a 
weakly basic anion exchange resin, e.g. Amberlite IR4B (which has been 
washed free from soluble colour with dilute hydrochloric acid and regener- 
ated with dilute aqueous ammonia) in the form of a column 60 cm long. 
Collect the effluent (in all about 2 litres) until it gives no colour when boiled 
with ninhydrin (Expt 5.99). Evaporate the effluent to dryness under reduced 
pressure (rotary evaporator) and boil the yellow solid residue with 20 ml of 
water and a little decolourising charcoal. Add ethanol to the hot filtered solu- 
tion until crystallisation begins and cool in ice to complete the separation of 
the L-alanine. The yield is 13.9 g (76%), [a] 2 , + 12.0° (c4 in 1 m HC1). 

Note. (1) An inexpensive crude commercial product (dried papaya latex) was used; 
the activity was not determined. Purified highly active enzyme preparations may, 
however, be obtained 259 (e.g. Koch-Light, Sigma, etc.).

CHAPTER 6 

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 



6.1 AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS 



Benzene (1) is the simplest aromatic hydrocarbon upon which our knowledge of 
aromatic chemistry is based. This hydrocarbon, the alkylbenzenes (2), the 
arylmethanes [e.g. diphenylmethane (3)], the biphenyls [e.g. biphenyl (4)] and 
the condensed polycyclic systems [e.g. naphthalene (5) and anthracene (6)] all 
exhibit chemical reactivity and spectroscopic features which are markedly 
different from their aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbon counterparts. Indeed the 
term aromatic character was introduced to specify the chemistry of this group of 
hydrocarbons and their substituted functional derivatives, and it was soon used 
to summarise the properties of certain groups of heterocyclic compounds having 
five- and six-membered ring systems and the associated condensed polycyclic 
analogues (Chapter 8). 

The crucial structural feature which underlies the aromatic character of 
benzenoid compounds is of course the cyclic delocalised system of six n- 
electrons. Other carbocyclic systems similarly possessing this 'aromatic sextet' of 
electrons include, for example, the ion C 5 H® formed from cyclopentadiene 
under basic conditions. The cyclopentadienide anion is centrosymmetrical and 
strongly resonance stabilised, and is usually represented as in (7). The analogous 
cycloheptatrienylium (tropylium) cation (8), with an aromatic sextet delocalised 
over a symmetrical seven-membered ring, is also demonstrably aromatic in 
character. The stable, condensed, bicyclic hydrocarbon azulene (Ci H 8 ) 
possesses marked aromatic character; it is usually represented by the covalent 
structure (9). The fact that the molecule has a finite dipole moment, however, 
suggests that the ionic form (10) [a combination of (7) and (8)] must contribute 
to the overall hybrid structure.

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

Aromatic hydrocarbons give rise to spectra which differ markedly from those of 
aliphatic and alicyclic hydrocarbons owing to the mesomeric stabilisation of the 
aromatic ring system. In the i.r. absorption spectrum of an aromatic hydrocar- 
bon there are four wavenumber regions which should be inspected to provide 
definitive evidence for the presence of an aromatic nucleus, and for the possible 
state of substitution: (a) at c. 3050 cm" 1 (Car— H stretching); (b) at 1600, 1590, 
1500 and 1450cm" 1 (ring-breathing vibrations); (c) at 650-820 cm" 1 (C AR — H 
out-of-plane vibrations); and (d) at 2000-1600cm _1 (summation bands) (p. 
278). The p.m.r. spectrum (e.g. Fig. 3.42 of toluene) also provides definitive 
evidence of the presence of an aromatic nucleus, since the aromatic protons are 
deshielded by the induced ring current sustained by the ^-electrons and they 
appear as signals at c. S 7.00 (p. 325). The l3 C-n.m.r. is discussed on p. 329 (see 
also Fig. 3.43). The u.v.-visible spectrum is more useful in the aromatic field than 
the aliphatic, since the energy associated with the 7r-electron transitions is 
markedly affected by the presence of a fused ring system or of substituent 
interaction in a mesomeric or inductive manner (p. 390). The profile of the m.s. of 
an aromatic compound also provides invaluable confirmation of the presence of 
an aromatic nucleus in that the relative abundance of the molecular ion and 
closely associated fragment ions is usually high compared to the low relative 
abundance found in the aliphatic series (p. 368). 

The isomeric xylenes provide a useful illustration of these spectroscopic 
features. Thus the i.r. spectrum of o-xylene (Fig. 3.16) shows absorption bands at 
c. 3050 cm" l and c. 2950 cm" J for the stretching vibrations of the aromatic and 
aliphatic carbon-bound hydrogens respectively. The ring-breathing vibrations 
are found at 1600, 1590, 1500 cm" 1 (the 1450 cm" 1 band is obscured by the 
methyl deformation absorption). The meta and para isomers show almost 
identical absorptions in these regions. However, the absorption in the 700- 
800 cm " l region clearly defines the state of substitution; for the ortho isomer the 
band at c. 740 cm" 1 indicates four adjacent hydrogens; for the meta isomer the 
bands are at c. 690 and 770 cm" 1 for three adjacent hydrogens and at c. 
870cm" 1 for one lone hydrogen; for the para isomer the band at c. 790cm" 1 
indicates two adjacent hydrogens. The three isomers each give a characteristic 
pattern in the summation band region when the spectra are appropriately 
recorded. The p.m.r. spectra of the three isomers do not clearly define the 
substitution pattern, the aromatic protons appearing as a four-proton singlet in 
the spectra of the ortho and para isomers, and as a multiplet in the case of the 
meta isomer. The m.s. of these isomers are very similar (ortho isomer, Fig. 3.76) 
and may be interpreted as m/z 106 (M), 105 (M — H), 91 (M — Me, base peak), 65 
(91 - C 2 H 2 ), 77 (91 - CH 2 ), 51 (77 - C 2 H 2 ) and 39 (65 - C 2 H 2 ).

The synthesis of aromatic hydrocarbons (arenes) is for convenience orga- 
nised under the following five headings. 

1. Alkylbenzenes (Expts 6.1 to 6.5). 

2. Di- and triarylmethanes (Expts 6.6 and 6.7). 

3. Biphenyl systems (Expts 6.8 to 6.10, see also Expt 6.79). 

4. Condensed polycyclic systems (Expts 6.11 to 6.14).

The synthesis of alkylbenzenes may be classified under: (a) the Wurtz-Fittig 
reaction; (b) the reduction of aryl aldehydes and ketones; and (c) and Friedel- 
Crafts alkylation reaction.

The Wurtz-Fittig reaction (cf. the Wurtz reaction, Section 5.1.4, p. 478). The 
interaction of an aryl halide, an alkyl halide and sodium gives a reasonable yield 
of an alkylbenzene. 

ArBr + RBr + 2Na &gt; Ar-R + 2NaBr 

The by-products of the reaction, e.g. R — R and Ar — Ar, can usually readily be 
separated by distillation. 

A likely mechanism for this reaction involves the formation of an arylsodium 
and its subsequent reaction with the alkyl halide. 

ArBr + 2Na &gt; Ar e Na® + NaBr 

Ar^'^R— Br &gt; Ar-R + :Br 

The reaction of the arylsodium with the more reactive alkyl bromide occurs in 
preference to reaction with the less reactive aryl bromide, which would lead to 

826 



AROMATIC COMPOUNOS 6.1 



the biaryl Ar — Ar. Furthermore, the formation of the aryl anion, which is likely 
to be stabilised by electron delocalisation, probably occurs more readily than 
the formation of the alkyl anion by reaction of the sodium with the alkyl 
bromide. For these reasons acceptable yields of the alkylbenzene are usually 
obtained. 

Better yields of alkylbenzenes result if the arylsodium is first prepared and 
then subjected to a suitable alkylation reaction. In the preparative example of 
butylbenzene (Expt 6.1), benzylsodium is conveniently obtained by first forming 
phenylsodium by reaction between sodium and chlorobenzene in a toluene 
medium, and then heating the toluene suspension of the phenylsodium at 105 °C 
for about 35 minutes when a transmetalation process occurs (formulated at the 
beginning of Expt 6.1). 

The Grignard reagent derived from benzyl chloride undergoes ready 
alkylation with an alkyl toluene-p-sulphonate, a reaction which provides a 
further useful synthesis of an alkylbenzene (e.g. pentylbenzene, Expt 6.2).

The reduction of aldehydes and ketones. Aromatic hydrocarbons are the main 
products when aromatic aldehydes or ketones are reduced with amalgamated 
zinc and concentrated hydrochloric acid (the Clemmensen reduction, e.g. 
hexylbenzene, Expt 6.3). 

Ar-CO-R »• Ar-CH 2 -R 

Some features of the Clemmensen reduction are discussed in Section 5.1.3, p. 
476. Purely aromatic ketones generally do not give satisfactory results: pinacols 
and resinous products often predominate. The reduction of ketonic compounds 
of high molecular weight and very slight solubility is facilitated by the addition 
of a solvent, such as ethanol, acetic acid or dioxane, which is miscible with 
aqueous hydrochloric acid. With some carbonyl compounds, notably keto 
acids, poor yields are obtained even in the presence of ethanol, etc., and the 
difficulty has been ascribed to the formation of insoluble polymolecular 
reduction products, which coat the surface of the zinc. The addition of a 
hydrocarbon solvent, such as toluene, is beneficial because it keeps most of the 
material out of contact with the zinc and the reduction occurs in the aqueous 
layer at such a high dilution that polymolecular reactions are largely inhibited 
(see Expt 6.123). 

Aryl alkyl ketones are readily prepared by the Friedel-Crafts acylation 
process (see Section 6.1 1.1, p. 1006) and their Clemmensen reduction constitutes a 
more efficient procedure for the preparation of monoalkylbenzenes than the 
alternative direct Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction (see below). Alternatively 
aldehydes and ketones may be reduced to the corresponding hydrocarbon by 
the Wolff-Kishner method which involves heating the corresponding hydrazone 
or semicarbazone with potassium hydroxide or with sodium ethoxide solution. 

Ar-CO-R -^1*. Ar-(R)C=N-NH 2 ^^&gt; Ar-CH 2 -R 

The Huang-Minion modification of the reaction has the following advantages: (i) 
the actual isolation of the hydrazone is unnecessary; (ii) the reaction time is 
considerably reduced; (iii) the reaction can be carried out at atmospheric 
pressure and on a large scale and; (iv) the yields are usually excellent. The 

827 



6.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



hydrazone is first formed in situ by refluxing a solution of the carbonyl 
compound in a moderate amount of diethylene glycol or triethylene glycol with 
the commercial 85 or 90 per cent hydrazine hydrate and about 3 equivalents of 
potassium hydroxide for 1 hour; the water and excess of hydrazine are removed 
by distillation until a favourable temperature for the decomposition of the 
hydrazone is attained (170-190 °C) and the solution is refluxed for 3-5 hours 
longer. 

An alternative milder procedure is the reduction of the corresponding 
toluene-p-sulphonylhydrazones with catecholborane, followed by decompo- 
sition of the intermediate with sodium acetate in the presence of dimethyl 
sulphoxide, or with tetrabutylammonium acetate. 1 These methods, which do 
not have the disadvantages of the Clemmensen reduction, are illustrated by the 
preparation of ethylbenzene from acetophenone (Expt 6.4, Methods A and B). 
Outline mechanisms for these reactions are given below.

The Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction. An alkyl halide reacts with an aromatic 
hydrocarbon in the presence of aluminium chloride to yield in the first instance a 
hydrocarbon, thus: 

ArH + RX ^^&gt; Ar-R + HX 

The reaction does not, however, stop at the stage of mono-substitution, since the 
alkylbenzene (Ar-R) initially produced undergoes alkylation more easily than 
the original hydrocarbon ArH, owing to the electron-releasing effect of the alkyl 
group. Mixtures of substances therefore often result and extensive purification 
may be required in order to isolate the monosubstituted compound. Some 
mono-alkylbenzenes may be prepared by using an excess of the hydrocarbon, 
which also acts as a diluent in moderating the violence of the reaction and 
prevents the undue formation of poly-alkylbenzenes. 

The mechanism of the reaction is generally considered to proceed by way of 
carbocations which attack the aromatic nucleus:

AROMATIC COMPOUNOS 6.1 



In many cases the alkyl group may undergo extensive skeletal rearrangement 
under the reaction conditions employed. For example, when benzene is 
alkylated with propyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride over a wide 
temperature range, a mixture of propylbenzene and isopropylbenzene, in 
approximately 1 : 2 ratio, is obtained. On the other hand isobutyl bromide or 
chloride with benzene in the presence of aluminium chloride gives exclusively 
t-butylbenzene. This alkylbenzene is, however, more conveniently prepared by 
using t-butyl chloride as the alkylating reagent (Expt 6.5). 

The rearrangement processes mentioned above involve a 1,2-nucleophilic 
shift of a hydride ion to form a more stable secondary or tertiary carbocation.

Other catalysts which may be used in the Friedel-Crafts alkylation reaction 
include iron(m) chloride, antimony pentachloride, zirconium tetrachloride, 
boron trifluoride, zinc chloride and hydrogen fluoride but these are generally 
not so effective in small-scale preparations. The alkylating agents include alkyl 
halides, alcohols and alkenes. 

Experiment 6.1 BUTYLBENZENE (2-Phenylbutane)

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask as detailed for p-toluic acid (Expt 6.158, 
Method A) and pass a slow stream of nitrogen through the apparatus. Charge 
the flask with 150 ml of sodium -dried, sulphur-free toluene (Section 4.1J, p. 
398) and 13.8g (0.6mol) of sodium wire. Place 34g (31ml, 0.3 mol) of 
chlorobenzene in the dropping funnel and add it dropwise through the 
condenser during 1 hour, with vigorous stirring, while maintaining the 
temperature inside the flask at 30-35 °C. The start of the reaction is indicated 
by the appearance of black specks on the sodium surface. (If the reaction is 
slow to start, it may be instantly initiated by a few drops of butanol.) 
Complete the formation of phenylsodium by stirring for 2-3 hours at 30 °C. 
Attach a calcium chloride tube to the top of the reflux condenser and reflux 
the mixture for 40 minutes. The reflux temperature, initially 107 °C, gradually 
falls to 103 °C as benzene is formed by the exchange reaction. Remove the 
heating bath and add 27.6 g (20.5 ml, 0.224 mol) of redistilled propyl bromide 
during 20-25 minutes at 103-105 °C; the reaction is strongly exothermic. 
Allow the reaction mixture to cool to room temperature: maintain the 
stirring and the slow stream of nitrogen. Add water slowly to destroy the 
excess of sodium. Separate the toluene layer, dry it (magnesium sulphate) and 
distil it through a short, jacketed column filled with glass helices (19 cm 
packed length, 14 mm diameter; compare Fig. 2.104). After removal of the 
toluene (up to 111 °C) and a small intermediate fraction (11 1-179 °C), pure 
butylbenzene passes over at 179.5-181 °C/752mmHg (23 g, 77%). A brown 
residue (4g) remains in the flask.

In a 1500-ml three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a sealed 
stirrer unit and a double surface condenser to which is attached a guard-tube 
filled with a mixture of calcium chloride and soda-lime, prepare an ethereal 
solution of benzylmagnesium chloride from 24.3 g (1 mol) of clean, dry 
magnesium turnings (under 100 ml of anhydrous ether) and a solution of 
126.5g (115 ml, 1 mol) of freshly distilled benzyl chloride in 500 ml of 
anhydrous ether. Use a crystal of iodine as a catalyst and proceed as 
described under the general procedure noted in Expt 5.39. Finally, cool the 
flask by immersion in a bath of ice-water. Place a solution of 456 g (2 mol) of 
butyl toluene-p-sulphonate (Expt 6.46) in about twice the volume of 
anhydrous ether in the dropping funnel, and add it slowly to the vigorously 
stirred benzylmagnesium chloride solution, at such a rate that the ether just 
boils; a white solid soon forms. The addition is complete after about 2 hours. 
Pour the reaction product slowly into a mechanically stirred mixture of 1 kg 
of finely crushed ice, 1 litre of water and 1 25 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid contained in a 4- or 5-litre beaker; the precipitated magnesium toluene- 
p-sulphonate will ultimately pass into the solution. Separate the ether layer, 
extract the aqueous layer with 250 ml of ether and wash the combined ether 
solutions with about 100 ml of water. Dry the ether solution with about 10 g 
of anhydrous potassium carbonate. Distil off the ether on a rotary 
evaporator, add to the mixture 5-7 g of sodium cut into small pieces and heat 
under reflux for about 2 hours in order to remove any benzyl alcohol which 
may have formed by atmospheric oxidation of benzylmagnesium chloride. 
Decant the solution and distil it from an air bath through a well-lagged and 
efficient fractionating column; collect the fraction, b.p. 190-210 °C. Redistil 
and collect the pentylbenzene at 198-203 °C. The yield is 90 g (61%). 

Record the i.r. spectrum and the p.m.r. spectrum and assign the 
absorptions using the spectra quoted above for butulbenzene (Expt 6.1) as a 
guide. Interpret the m.s. which shows principal fragment ions at m/z 148, 105,

condenser, a sealed stirrer and a gas entry tube reaching to within 1 cm of the 
bottom; connect the last-named through an intermediate empty wash bottle 
to a Kipp's apparatus supplying hydrogen chloride gas (Section 4.2.38, p. 
438). Place a mixture of 500 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 100ml 
of water in the flask and introduce 100 g (0.57 mol) of l-phenylhexan-3-one 
(Expt 5.93). Stir the mixture and pass a slow stream of hydrogen chloride gas 
while warming the flask on a suitable wire gauze by means of a small flame. If 
the reaction becomes unduly vigorous, stop the supply of hydrogen chloride 
until it subsides somewhat. Most of the zinc dissolves after 6 hours, by which 
time the reaction is almost complete; allow to stand overnight. Arrange the 
apparatus for steam distillation (Fig. 2.102) and pass steam into the flask, 
heated by means of a small flame, until the distillate is clear. Separate the 
upper hydrocarbon layer, wash it with 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, 
then with water and dry over magnesium sulphate. Distil from a 100 ml flask 
and at 21 8-230 °C collect the crude hexyl benzene, which contains some 
unsaturated compounds. These can be removed by repeated shaking with 5 
per cent of the volume of concentrated sulphuric acid until the latter is 
colourless or, at most, very pale yellow. The hydrocarbon is then washed with 
5 per cent sodium carbonate solution, then with water and dried over 
magnesium sulphate. It is then distilled twice from sodium when pure 
hexylbenzene, b.p. 220-225 °C is obtained. The yield is 40 g (43%).

potassium hydroxide has dissolved and then heat under reflux for 1 hour 
either by means of a free flame or by using a heating mantle. Remove the 
reflux condenser and fit a still-head and condenser for downward distillation. 
Distil until the temperature of the liquid rises to 175 °C (1). Separate the

6.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Note. (1) The reduction takes place at a comparatively low temperature and is fairly 
rapid for acetophenone. With higher ketones, the upper layer of the distillate should 
be returned to the contents of the flask and the heating under reflux continued for 3-5 
hours. The reaction mixture and the aqueous distillate are then combined, extracted 
with ether and the ether extract treated as described above. 

Method B. The toluene-p-sulphonylhydrazone of acetophenone (0.721 g, 
2.5mmol) (1), m.p. 140-141.5 °C, is placed in a flame-dried, nitrogen-filled 
flask containing 5 ml of chloroform. Catecholborane (0.52 ml, 5.0mmol) 
(Section 4.2.7, p. 420) is added and the reduction allowed to proceed for 2 
hours at room temperature (2). Methanol (1 ml) is added to destroy the 
excess of hydride followed by the addition of tetrabutylammonium acetate 
(0.7 g, 2.5mmol). The reaction mixture is stirred for 4 hours when g.l.c. 
analysis indicates a 94 per cent yield of ethylbenzene. The product is isolated 
by distillation, yield 0.21 g (79%), b.p. 132-136 °C. 

Notes. (1) The general procedure for the preparation of toluene-p-

CAUTION: This preparation should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 

Into a 1 -litre three-necked flask, equipped as in Expt 6.121, place 50 g 
(0.33 mol) of anhydrous aluminium chloride (1) and 200 ml (2.25 mol) of dry 
benzene (CAUTION); cool in a bath of crushed ice. Stir the mixture and add 
50 g (59 ml, 0.54 mol) of t-butyl chloride (Expt 5.49) from the dropping funnel 
during 4-5 hours; the first addition should be 3-4 ml in order to prevent the 
benzene from freezing. Maintain the mixture at a temperature of 0-5 °C by 
the addition of salt to the ice, if necessary. When all the t-butyl chloride has 
been run in, continue the stirring for 1 hour longer. Remove the separatory 
funnel and add 200 g of finely crushed ice in small portions with stirring; 
finally add 100 ml of cold water to complete the decomposition of the 
intermediate addition compound. Arrange the flask for steam distillation 
(Fig. 2.102) and steam distil the resulting reaction mixture. Transfer the steam 
distillate to a separatory funnel, remove the upper hydrocarbon layer, extract 
the water layer with two 50 ml portions of ether and combine the extracts 
with the upper layer. Dry with magnesium sulphate, distil off the ether on a 
water bath and fractionally distil the residue twice, using a well-lagged 
column (Fig. 2.104). Collect the t-butylbenzene at 165-170 °C. The yield is 
45g (62%). Pure t-butylbenzene boils at 168.5 °C. 

Note the characteristic absorptions for the aromatic system at 
c. 3050 cm" 1 , at 1600, 1590 and 1500 cm" 1 and at c. 700 and 765 cm " l for a 
monosubstituted nucleus. The t-butyl group shows characteristic carbon- 
hydrogen stretching absorptions at c. 2950 cm" 1 . 

Note. (1) In an alternative procedure 25 g of anhydrous iron(m) chloride replace the 
aluminium chloride, the mixture is cooled to 10 °C and the 50 g of t-butyl chloride are 
added. The mixture is slowly warmed to 25 °C and maintained at this temperature 
until no more hydrogen chloride is evolved. The reaction mixture is then washed with

6.1.2 Dl- AND TRIARYLMETHANES 

Alkylation with benzyl chloride by the Friedel-Crafts procedure yields di- 
phenylmethane (Expt 6.6). The reactive nature of the halide obviates the need 
for heating the reaction mixture, and a smaller proportion of aluminium chloride 
is employed compared to the standard conditions as illustrated by Expt 6.5. 

A Friedel-Crafts reaction between chloroform and an excess of benzene 
affords a convenient route to triphe.nylmethane (cognate preparation in Expt 
6.6). 

3PhH + CHC1 3 »• Ph 3 CH 

The synthesis of the triptycene system illustrates a synthetic use of the 
important reactive intermediate benzyne (13) which is generated by the thermal 
decomposition of benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate (see Section 6.5.3, p. 900). 
The latter is produced when anthranilic acid (1 1) is treated with an alkyl nitrite 
in an aprotic solvent, and probably exists mainly as the zwitterionic form (12). 

o 

(12) (13) 

The benzyne functions as a dienophile towards reactive diene systems. The 
reactivity of the 9,10-positions in anthracene is well known (Diels-Alder 
reaction, Section 7.6), and addition of benzyne to 9-bromoanthracene yields the 
interesting cage-ring alkyl halide: 9-bromotriptycene (9-bromo-9,10-o- 
benzenoanthracene). The reaction is incomplete and some unreacted 9- 
bromoanthracene remains in the crude reaction products, but may be removed 
by virtue of its ready conversion into a maleic anhydride adduct in a further 
Diels-Alder-type reaction. 

The environment of the halogen in the ring structure renders it almost 
unreactive in displacement reactions by nucleophiles.

further portion of the aluminium chloride and repeat the process until all has 
been introduced. The mixture should be kept well shaken and immersed in 
the ice bath during the addition. After 15 minutes cautiously add lOOg of 
crushed ice, followed by 100 ml of water in order to decompose the 
aluminium complex. Shake the mixture well, transfer to a separatory funnel 
and run off the lower aqueous layer. Wash the upper layer successively with 
dilute hydrochloric acid and water and dry it with anhydrous calcium 
chloride. Remove the benzene with the aid of the apparatus shown in Fig. 
2.101. Distil the remaining liquid through an air condenser either with a free 
flame or from an air bath. Collect the diphenylmethane at 250-275 °C (the 
pure substance boils at 262 °C) (1). The distillate should solidify on cooling in 
ice and scratching with a glass rod, or by seeding with a crystal of the pure 
material. If it does not crystallise, redistil from a small flask and collect the 
fraction, b.p. 255-267 G C; this generally crystallises on cooling and has m.p. 
24-25 °C. The yield is 25 g (50%). 

Note. (1) Alternatively the distillation may be conducted under diminished pressure; 
the fraction, b.p. 125-1 30 °C/10mmHg, is collected. 

Cognate preparation. Triphenylmethane. The apparatus is similar to that 
described above, but incorporating a reflux condenser to the outlet of which 
is fitted the gas absorption device. Place a mixture of 200 g (230 ml, 2.57 mol) 
of dry benzene (CAUTION) and 40 g (26 ml, 0.33 mol) of dry chloroform 
(CAUTION) (Section 4.1.6, p. 399) in the flask, and add 35 g (0.26 mol) of 
anhydrous aluminium chloride in portions of about 6 g and at intervals of 5 
minutes with constant stirring. The reaction sets in upon the addition of the 
aluminium chloride and the liquid boils with the evolution of hydrogen 
chloride. Complete the reaction by refluxing for 30 minutes on a water bath. 
When cold, pour the contents of the flask very cautiously on to 250 g of 
crushed ice and 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Separate the upper 
benzene layer, dry it with anhydrous calcium chloride or with magnesium 
sulphate and remove the benzene by flash distillation (Fig. 2.101). Attach a 
Claisen still-head connected to a short air condenser and distil the remaining 
oil under reduced pressure; collect the fraction, b.p. 190-215 °C/10mmHg. 
This is crude triphenylmethane which solidifies on cooling. Recrystallise it 
from about four times its weight of ethanol; triphenylmethane separates in 
needles and melts at 92 °C. The yield is 30 g (37%).

condenser. Heat the mixture to gentle reflux on an electric mantle and add 
down the condenser, dropwise during 30 minutes, a solution of 3.4 g 
(0.025 mol) of anthranilic acid in 15 ml of glyme. Remove the mantle, cool the 
mixture to about 40 °C and add 2.3 g more of isopentyl nitrite dissolved in 
5 ml of glyme. Resume the gentle refluxing and add during 15 minutes 
another solution of 3.4 g of anthranilic acid in 10 ml of glyme. Heat for an 
additional 1 5 minutes, add 1 ml of 9 5 per cent ethanol and pour the reaction 
mixture into a solution of 3.0 g of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml of water. Cool 
the resulting brown suspension thoroughly in ice-water and filter under 
suction. Wash the residue with a chilled methanol/water mixture (4 : 1 v/v) 
and transfer to a 100-ml round-bottomed flask which is then evacuated 
(rotary evaporator) on a steam bath until the weight is constant. 

To the flask containing the crude product, add 2.0 g (0.02 mol) of maleic 
anhydride and 25 ml of triethyleneglycol dimethyl ether ('triglyme', b.p. 
222 °C), fit a reflux condenser and boil under reflux for 10 minutes over a 
Bunsen flame. Cool the solution to about 100 °C, add 10ml of 95 per cent

Wash the residue with chilled methanol/water (4 : 1 v/v) and recrystallise from 
methylcyclohexane or a chloroform/methanol mixture to give colourless 
plates of 9-bromotriptycene, m.p. 251-256 °C; yield is 1.5 g (45%). Further 
recrystallisation gives the pure product, m.p. 258-262 °C. 

6.1.3 BIPHENYL SYSTEMS 

A reaction which is reminiscent of the Wurtz coupling procedure, and which is 
particularly valuable in the syntheiss of biphenyl and its symmetrically 
substituted derivatives, is that of Ullmann. It involves heating an aryl halide with 
copper powder, or better, with activated copper bronze. 

2ArX + 2Cu &gt; Ar - Ar + 2CuX 

Aryl iodides and bromides are more reactive than the corresponding chlorides 
but the latter may be used when activating substituents (e.g. the nitro group) are 
present, as for example in the synthesis of 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl (Expt 6.8). The 
coupling reaction can be effectively carried out in the absence of a solvent, but 
the use of dimethylformamide as a solvent and diluent often results in an 
increase of yield, particularly in the case of reactive halides, when the vigour of 
the exothermic reaction is moderated. 

The symmetrically substituted biphenyl system is also formed when aryl 
radicals generated from an appropriate precursor are allowed to undergo a self- 
coupling process. An interesting reaction involving the use of the diazonium salt 
derived from anthranilic acid affords an excellent method of preparing biphenyl- 
2,2'-dicarboxylic acid (diphenic acid, Expt 6.9). The diazotised anthranilic acid is 
reduced with the aid of a cupro-ammonia reagent obtained by dissolving 
copper(n) sulphate in aqueous ammonia and treating the solution with 
hydroxylamine hydrochloride.

PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Unsymmetrically substituted biphenyls may be prepared from diazonium 
salts by means of the Gomberg-Bachmann-Hey reaction. 2 Some preparative 
examples of the classical method and of a PTC procedure are described in Expt 
6.79. 3 

Reactive aromatic systems, in particular phenols, readily undergo oxidation 
by a single electron transfer process, leading to a mesomerically stabilised 
radical species, which then dimerises. The coupling of phenols in this way is 
frequently encountered in biogenetic pathways leading to naturally occurring 
molecules. A reaction illustrative of the process is the oxidation of 2-naphthol 
with iron(m) chloride (Expt 6.12) to give 2,2'-dihydroxy-l,l'-binaphthyl (l,l'-bi- 
2-naphthol). 




&gt; etc. 



This compound, in common with other suitable substituted biphenyls, possesses 
a chiral axis (p. 6) and is isolated from the reaction as a racemate. Although 
several resolution procedures have been reported, the superior method to date 4 
is that in which the binaphthol is first converted by treatment with phosphorus 
oxychloride into the binaphthyl phosphoric acid (14). Resolution is then effected 
by formation of diastereoisomeric salts with ( + )-cinchonine, appropriate 
fractional crystallisation and recovery of the (S)-( + )-binaphthyl phosphoric 
acid. Suitable hydrolysis gives (S)-( — )-l,l'-bi-2-naphthol (15).

Earlier attempts to effect an asymmetric coupling to mimic biological coupling 
reactions by using chiral copper(n)-amine complexes gave only low enant- 
iomeric excesses. 5 The use of (S)-( + )-amphetamine sulphate 

[Ph-CH 2 - CH(NH 3 )-Me}HS04 ] with copper(n) nitrate was more successful in 
that the (S)-( — )-enantiomer (15) was formed in 85 per cent chemical yield and 
95 per cent optical purity. 6 (S)-(-)-10,10'-Dihydroxy-9,9'-biphenanthryl has 
been similarly prepared from the coupling of 9-phenanthrol, using (#)-( — )-l,2- 
diphenylethylamine and copper(n) nitrate. 7 Enantioselective syntheses of

binaphthyls using chiral oxazolines in the coupling reaction have also been 
reported. 8 These chiral biaryls may be complexed with metal hydrides and used 
in the chiral reduction of, for example, the carbonyl group (p. 521).

Place 50 g (0.32 mol) of o-chloronitrobenzene and 75 g of clean dry sand in a 
250-ml three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an air 
reflux condenser. Heat the mixture in an oil or fusible metal bath to 215- 
225 °C and add, during 40 minutes, 50 g (0.78 mol) of copper bronze or, 
better, of activated copper bronze (Section 4.2.19, p. 426) (1). Maintain the 
temperature at 215-225 °C for a further 90 minutes and stir continuously. 
Pour the hot mixture into a Pyrex beaker containing 125 g of sand and stir 
until small lumps are formed; if the reaction mixture is allowed to cool in the 
flask, it will set to a hard mass, which can only be removed by breaking the 
flask. Break up the small lumps by powdering in a mortar, and boil them for 
10 minutes with two 400 ml portions of ethanol; filter after each extraction. 
Cool the filtered extracts in ice, and collect the crude product on a Buchner 
funnel. Concentrate the filtrate to about half the original volume and thus 
obtain a second crop of crystals. The total yield of crude solid should be 
about 24 g; if it is less than this, a third extraction of the reaction product 
should be made. Dissolve the crude solid in about 400 ml of hot ethanol, add 
a little decolourising charcoal, boil for a few minutes, filter and cool in ice. 
Recrystallise again from hot ethanol. The yield of pure 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl, 
m.p. 123-124 °C, is 20-22 g (54%). 

The experimental conditions for conducting the above reaction in 
dimethylformamide as solvent are as follows. In a 250-ml three-necked flask, 
equipped with a reflux condenser and a tantalum wire Hershberg-type stirrer, 
place 20 g of o-chloronitrobenzene and 100 ml of dimethylformamide (dried 
over anhydrous calcium sulphate). Heat the solution to reflux and add 20 g of 
activated copper bronze in one portion. Heat under reflux for 4 hours, add 
another 20 g portion of copper powder and continue refluxing for a second 4- 
hour period. Allow to cool, pour the reaction mixture into 2 litres of water 
and filter with suction. Extract the solids with three 200 ml portions of boiling 
ethanol: alternatively, use 300 ml of ethanol in a Soxhlet apparatus. Isolate 
the 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl from the alcoholic extracts as described above: the 
yield of product, m.p. 124-125 "C, is 11. 5g (75%). 

Note. (1) If the temperature is allowed to rise above 240 °C, reduction of the nitro 
groups will occur and carbazole will be formed.

The reducing agent (a solution containing cupro-ammonia ions) is first 
prepared. Dissolve 63 g (0.25 mol) of crystallised copper(n) sulphate in 250 ml 
of water in a 1 -litre beaker, add 100 ml of concentrated ammonium hydroxide 
solution (d 0.88) and cool the solution to 10 °C. Dissolve 17.8 g (0.256 mol) of 
hydroxylammonium chloride or 21 g (0.256 mol) of hydroxylammonium 
sulphate in 60 ml of water, cool to 10 °C and add 42.5 ml of 6 m sodium 
hydroxide solution; if the resulting solution of hydroxylamine is not clear, 
filter it at the pump. Without delay add the hydroxylamine solution, with 
stirring, to the ammoniacal copper(n) sulphate solution. Reduction occurs at 
once, a gas is evolved and the solution assumes a pale blue colour. Protect the 
reducing agent from the air if it is not used immediately. 

Grind 25 g (0.1 8 mol) of anthranilic acid (Expt 6.53) with 46 ml of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 75 ml of water in a glass mortar, and 
transfer the suspension to a 500-ml round-bottomed flask which is provided 
with a mechanical stirrer. Cool the contents of the flask in an ice bath to 0- 
5°C, and add a solution of 13.0g (0.19 mol) of sodium nitrite in 175 ml of 
water from a dropping funnel during about 20 minutes. Keep the diazonium 
solution below 5 °C and, if it is not clear, filter it by suction through a chilled 
Buchner funnel immediately before use. 

Surround the reducing solution in the 1 -litre beaker (which is equipped 
with a mechanical stirrer) with a bath of crushed ice so that the temperature 
of the solution is about 10 °C. Attach, by means of a short length of rubber 
tubing, to the stem of a dropping funnel a glass tube which dips well below 
the surface of the solution and is bent upwards at the end and constricted so 
that the opening is about 2 mm (this arrangement ensures that the diazonium 
solution reacts with the ammoniacal solution in the beaker and prevents the 
latter rising in the stem of the funnel). Place about 45 ml of the cold 
diazonium solution in the funnel and add it at the rate of about 10 ml per 
minute while the mixture is stirred. Add the remainder of the diazonium 
solution at the same rate; continue the stirring for 5 minutes after the addition 
is complete. Heat the solution rapidly to boiling and carefully acidify with 
125 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid; the diphenic acid precipitates as 
pale brown crystals. Allow to stand overnight and filter with suction; wash 
the crude diphenic acid with about 25 ml of cold water. Suspend the crude 
acid in 100 ml of water and add 20 g of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate. 
Filter the resulting solution by gravity, and then boil with about 0.5 g of 
decolourising carbon; filter and acidify the filtrate while still hot with excess 
of dilute hydrochloric acid (1:1). Collect the precipitated diphenic acid on a 
Buchner funnel, wash it with 20 ml of cold water and dry at 100 °C. The yield 
of diphenic acid is 18 g (82%); it melts at 227-228 °C and usually possesses a 
light cream colour.

In a 1 -litre three-necked flask, provided with a dropping funnel, a sealed 
stirrer and a reflux condenser, place 14.4g (0.1 mol) of 2-naphthol and 600 ml 
of water, and heat to the boiling point. To the boiling liquid containing liquid 
2-naphthol in suspension, add slowly through the dropping funnel and with 
vigorous stirring a solution of 28 g (0.1 mol) of crystallised iron(m) chloride in 
60 ml of water. The oily drops of 2-naphthol will disappear and the bis-2- 
naphthol separates out in flakes. Boil for 5-10 minutes, filter the hot 
suspension at the pump through a previously warmed Buchner funnel, wash 
with boiling water and dry in the air upon filter paper. The crude product 
weighs 9g. Recrystallise from toluene (about 150 ml); almost colourless 
crystals (7.5 g, 52%), m.p. 218 °C, are obtained. 

6.1.4 CONDENSED POLYCYCLIC SYSTEMS 

Dehydrogenation (the conversion of alicyclic or hydroaromatic compounds 
into their aromatic counterparts by removal of hydrogen - and also, in some 
cases, of other atoms or groups) has found wide application in the determina- 
tion of structure of natural products containing complex hydroaromatic 
systems. Dehydrogenation is employed also for the synthesis of polycyclic 
hydrocarbons and their derivatives from readily accessible synthetic hydro- 
aromatic compounds. The general process is illustrated by the conversion of 
tetralin into naphthalene. 




The principal dehydrogenation agents are (i) sulphur, (ii) selenium and (iii) 
catalytic metals. With sulphur, the general method is to heat the compound at 
200-260 °C with the theoretical amount of sulphur required to convert it into an 
aromatic system. In the case of selenium, the substance is heated with a large 
excess of selenium at 280-350 °C for 36-48 hours. Better yields (and less side 
reactions) are usually obtained than with sulphur, but, owing to the higher 
temperature, rearrangements are more likely. Oxygen-containing groups are 
particularly prone to elimination. Palladium and platinum catalysts are generally 
employed with a charcoal carrier. The dehydrogenation can be conducted in the 
vapour phase by distilling the compound through a tube containing the catalyst 
heated to 300-350 °C, but the liquid phase method is generally more convenient. 
Charcoal is employed containing 10-30 per cent of the metal. It has been 
established that the best results are obtained by conducting the process in an 
actively boiling medium (e.g. mesitylene, b.p. 165 °C; p-cymene, b.p. 177 °C; 
naphthalene, b.p. 218 °C; and 1-methylnaphthalane, b.p. 242 °C) and to provide 
for the removal of the hydrogen as it is formed (e.g. by sweeping the system with 
a stream of carbon dioxide). 

Examples of dehydrogenation processes are to be found in the synthetic 
sequences described in Expts 6.11 and 6.12. In the former instance, 
1-methylnaphthalene is synthesised from a-tetralone by first introducing a 
1-methyl substituent by reaction with methylmagnesium iodide. The resulting 
tertiary alcohol undergoes dehydration and dehydrogenation on heating with a 
palladium-on-charcoal catalyst. The preparation of the ketonic starting material 
from benzene is described in Expt 6.123 (see also Section 6.11.1, p. 1006); the 

839 



6.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



conversion of a-tetralone into 1-methylnaphthalene completes the reaction 
sequence known as the Haworth procedure for the synthesis of polycyclic 
aromatic hydrocarbons. 

Intramolecular cyclisation of a 4-arylbutanoic acid system is also an important 
step in a convenient synthesis of the polycyclic system, chrysene, which is 
formulated and described in Expt 6.12. Here, methyl cinnamate is first subjected 
to reductive dimerisation to give methyl meso-/J,y-diphenyladipate, which is 
accompanied by some of the ( + )-form. The meso isomer (16) is the most easily 
isolable and cyclisation occurs smoothly in sulphuric acid to yield the diketone 
2,ll-dioxo-l,2,9,10,ll,18-hexahydrochrysene, which is obtained as the trans 
form (17) as shown in the following formulation. Clemmensen reduction of this 
ketone followed by dehydrogenation (in this case using selenium) completes the 
synthesis of chrysene.

The synthesis of a tetraphenyl derivative (rubrene, Expt 6. 1 3) of the linearly 
fused tetracyclic aromatic hydrocarbon naphthacene involves an interesting 
intermolecular cyclisation process between two molecules of 1-chloro- 1,3,3- 
triphenylpropa-l,2-diene. This substituted allene is formed in situ from 1,1,3- 
triphenylprop-2-yn-l-ol (Expt 5.41) when the latter is allowed to react with 
thionyl chloride and the resulting chlorosulphite ester heated with a little 
quinoline; cyclisation occurs spontaneously under these reaction conditions to 
give rubrene which has an intense red colour.

The synthesis of 9-phenylphenanthrene (Expt 6.14) illustrates the formation 
of the phenanthrene system by the cyclisation of a 1,2-diphenylethylene 
(stilbene). The process involves an allowed photochemical cyclisation which 
gives initially a dihydrophenanthrene. This is readily dehydrogenated in situ by 
molecular oxygen in the presence of iodine.

The method has been applied to the synthesis of a range of substituted

some electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g. N0 2 , Me*CO) are present.

sublimate which gradually forms so that it runs back into the reaction 
mixture. Remove the cooled product and grind it in a mortar to a fine

with 200 ml of benzene, filter and reflux the filtered extract over a little clean 
sodium wire (or thin narrow slices of sodium metal); this treatment removes 
traces of selenium. Evaporate the benzene solution using a rotary evaporator

the latter may be recovered by evaporating the ether and crystallising the residue from 
the minimum of methanol; m.p. 70-71 °C.

Note. (1) If the product does not solidify it must be purified by distillation under 
reduced pressure using an efficient oil-immersion pump; b.p. 190°C/0.05mmHg.

Triphenylethylene. Equip a 2-litre, three-necked round-bottomed flask with a 
sealed stirrer unit, a 250-ml dropping funnel and a double surface condenser. 
All the apparatus should be rigorously dried and the dropping funnel and 
reflux condenser protected by calcium chloride guard-tubes. Place in the flask 
12.2g (0.50 mol) of magnesium turnings and about 250 ml of ether previously 
dried over anhydrous calcium chloride. In the funnel place a solution of 
57.5 ml (63.3 g, 0.50 mol) of freshly distilled benzyl chloride in about 100 ml of 
dry ether. Without stirring the contents of the flask run in about 20 ml of the 
benzyl chloride solution and then add a large crystal of iodine and allow the 
mixture to stand undisturbed. Reaction commences after about 5 minutes 
and the magnesium begins to dissolve. Add the benzyl chloride solution 
dropwise at such a rate as to maintain a steady reflux of the ether solvent. 
When the reaction is well established, start the stirrer motor and stir the 
reaction mixture at a moderate rate. When all the benzyl chloride solution 
has been added (about half an hour), heat the flask in an electric heating 
mantle and with continued stirring maintain a vigorous rate of reflux for a 
further half an hour. Turn off the heating mantle but continue stirring fairly 
rapidly, and add from the dropping funnel a solution of 91.1 g (0.50 mol) of 
benzophenone in about 250 ml of dry ether. The rate of addition should be 
sufficient to maintain rapid reflux. On completion of the addition (about 15

minutes) heat under reflux with stirring for a further half an hour before 
allowing the reaction mixture to stand at room temperature for at least 2 
hours or preferably overnight. Cool the reaction mixture in an ice-water bath, 
add 400 g of crushed ice to the flask contents, followed by 250 ml of cold 2.5 m 
sulphuric acid. Transfer the reaction mixture to a 3-litre separating funnel, 
run off the aqueous layer and extract with two 150 ml portions of ether. 
Combine the ether layer and extracts, dry over calcium sulphate and 
evaporate the ether on a rotary evaporator. To the syrupy residue add 100ml 
of 2.5 m sulphuric acid and boil vigorously under reflux for 2 hours. Cool the 
mixture to room temperature, add 50 ml of ether and shake vigorously. 
Transfer the resulting emulsion to a 1 -litre separatory funnel, wash the flask 
thoroughly with a mixture of 50 ml of water and 50 ml of ether and add this to 
the separatory funnel. After a few minutes the emulsion separates into two 
layers and the aqueous fraction can be run off and extracted with two 50 ml 
portions of ether. Combine the ether layer and extracts (1), and evaporate the 
ether using a rotary evaporator. Distil the residue under reduced pressure 
collecting the main fraction (93 g, 73%) at 196-200 °C/2.5mmHg. Dissolve 
the greenish-yellow syrupy distillate in 450 ml of hot 95 per cent aqueous 
ethanol and allow to cool slowly. Trituration is usually required to induce 
crystallisation. Complete the crystallisation process by cooling in ice-water 
and filter under suction to obtain 85 g (66%) of colourless crystals having 
m.p. 68-69 °C. Further recrystallisations from ethanol or acetic acid gives 
pure triphenylethylene, m.p. 72-73 °C. 

9-Phenylphenanthrene. The photochemical reactor should be completely 
screened with metal foil to avoid hazards from stray radiation (see Section 
2.17.5, p. 113). Dissolve 2.56g (0.01 mol) of triphenylethylene and 0.127g 
(0.0005 mol) of iodine in 1 litre of redistilled cyclohexane contained in a 
photochemical reactor vessel of 1 -litre capacity and fitted with a 100-W 
medium-pressure mercury arc lamp in a water-cooled quartz immersion well 
(Section 2.17.5, p. 1 10, Fig. 2.67(f)). Place the apparatus on a magnetic stirrer 
unit, insert a magnetic follower and with both the side-necks of the vessel 
open to the atmosphere irradiate the stirred solution until all the triphenyl- 
ethylene has reacted (2); this should take approximately 21-22 hours. There 
is no observable change in the colour of the cyclohexane solution during the 
irradiation. Remove the reaction mixture and evaporate to dryness under 
reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator to obtain the crude phenylphenan- 
threne as a pale fawn solid. Purify by column chromatography as follows. 
Dissolve the solid in 60 ml of warm cyclohexane, allow to cool and pour on to 
a short (c. 2 cm x 7 cm) column of neutral alumina (c. 16-17 g, Activity I, 
prepared as a slurry in cyclohexane). Collect the eluate, and when most of the 
solution has passed down the column rinse the flask which contained the 
solid with two 10 ml portions of cyclohexane and add to the column. When 
this has also been adsorbed, elute with a further 100-120 ml of cyclohexane or 
until no more phenylphenanthrene is obtained in the eluate. It is best to 
monitor the elution of the product by collecting and evaporating 40 ml 
fractions; a band of yellow material should remain near the top of the column 
and elution of this must be avoided. Crystallise the solid so obtained from 
60 ml of ethanol and collect the crystals which separate by suction filtration; a 
second crop may be obtained by concentrating the filtrate to c. 20 ml and

cooling in ice. The yield of 9-phenylphenanthrene (white needles), m.p. 104.5- 
105.5 °C, is 2.16g (85%) (3). 

Notes. (1) Do not wash the ethereal fraction with water or with aqueous sodium 
hydrogen carbonate solution, since the presence of a trace of sulphuric acid during the 
final distillation is necessary to complete the dehydration. 

(2) The irradiation time for complete reaction will depend on the power of the 
mercury arc used; in particular the light output of a lamp will vary with its age and use 
of a higher wattage lamp will, of course, shorten the reaction time required. The extent 
of the reaction may be most conveniently followed by g.l.c. of 0.5 \A samples of the 
reaction solution on a 1.5-m column of Methyl Silicone Gum S.E.30 on Chromosorb W 
held at 240 °C and with a nitrogen flow rate of 40 ml/minute. Triphenylethylene and 9- 
phenylphenanthrene have t R 2.3 minutes and 5.2 minutes respectively, cyclohexane 
has t R 0.5 minutes. Alternatively the reaction may be followed by evaporating 5-10 ml 
portions of the solution and recording the infrared spectrum of the residue as a mull in 
Nujol. Bands at 887(m), 750(m) and 738(s)cm~ 1 characteristic of 9-phenylphen- 
anthrene gradually appear and increase in intensity relative to bands due to the 
stilbene at 872(w) and 757(s)cm~' which gradually disappear. Other regions of the 
spectrum of the individual compounds are very similar and it is advisable to use the 
scale expansion adjustment of the instrument to enable the bands in the low 
wavenumber region to be readily identified. 

(3) For the preparation of larger amounts of the phenanthrene the reaction should be 
repeated; photolysis of more concentrated solutions is to be avoided in order to 
minimise the possibility of photodimerisation to give a cyclobutane derivative. 

6.1.5 SOME N0N-BENZEN0ID SYSTEMS 

Two examples, namely ferrocene and azulene, are selected to illustrate this 
group of aromatic compounds. 

The former is prepared (Expt 6. 1 5) by the reaction of cyclopentadiene with 
iron(n) chloride in the presence of diethylamine. Iron(n) chloride is prepared in 
situ from iron(m) chloride in tetrahydrofuran by reduction with iron metal. This 
preparation is one of the simplest for ferrocene, although not of general 
application for substituted ferrocenes. The acetylation of ferrocene in a Friedel- 
Crafts manner to yield the monoacetyl derivative is described in Expt 6.122. 

The aromatic character of ferrocene originates in the anionic cyclopen- 
tadienide system (18), which has six 7r-electrons delocalised over a symmetrical 
cyclic five-carbon system. Coordination of two such ring systems with a metal 
ion (iron in the case of ferrocene) in a sandwich-like structure (20) gives rise to a 
remarkably stable compound. 




(21) 

It is possible that the cyclopentadienide system also contributes to the 
structure of the undoubtedly aromatic azulene molecule (21) which may be 

847 



6.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



regarded as a condensed bicyclic system comprised of the anion (18) in 
combination with the cycloheptatrienylium ion (19) - the latter also has an 
aromatic sextet of six ^-electrons, disposed in this case over a seven-membered 
ring. Alternatively azulene may be viewed as a conjugated cyclodecapentaene 
with an additional transannular C — C single bond; such a structure is predicted 
to be aromatic by the Huckel (4n + 2) rule, having ten 7r-electrons in a cyclic 
system. 

The preparation of azulene (Expt 6.16) provides an interesting series of 
rearrangements. 9 The key step in the synthesis is the intramolecular insertion 
reaction, carried out under conditions of high dilution, of the ketocarbene (22) 
into the 1,2-position of the benzene ring. The unstable norcaradiene (23) which 
is formed then ring-opens to the bicyclic trienone (24), which isomerises to the 
more stable cross-conjugated trienone (25) during isolation. Dehydration of the 
trienone with a mixture of phosphorus pentoxide and methanesulphonic acid 
yields azulene. 




(22) 



(23) 





The ketocarbene is formed from 3-phenylpropanoyl chloride (dihydrocinnamic 
acid chloride) and diazomethane; ring substituted dihydrocinnamic acids 
provide a route to substituted azulenes. Alternatively the keto group in (25) may 
be treated with a Grignard reagent for the introduction of alkyl substituents into 
the five-membered ring.

phenylpropanoyl chloride dropwise during 1 hour with magnetic stirring. At 
the end of the addition the reaction mixture is stirred 1 hour more in the cold

Azulene. A mixture of 5g (35mmol) of phosphorus pentoxide (weighed

is homogeneous, 0.48 g (3.3 mmol) of (25) is added neat, dropwise during 7 
minutes. The solution rapidly darkens to orange-brown. Progress of the 
reaction is followed by removing one-drop aliquot portions and quenching 
them into water-hexane. The u.v. spectrum of the hexane layer shows a 
gradual decrease in the absorption at 226 nm due to (25) and the 
corresponding growth of the characteristic three-line pattern due to azulene 
around 274 nm. When the 226 nm absorption is no longer discernible (about 
6 hours), the reaction mixture is poured into 500 ml of ice-cold water and 
extracted twice with pentane. The dark-blue pentane layers are combined and 
washed with water until neutral, washed with saturated sodium chloride 
solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated under reduced 
pressure. The oily blue residue is purified by preparative layer chroma- 
tography on silica gel (1) using pentane as the eluant to give 130-210mg (30- 
50%) of azulene as beautiful dark-blue crystals, m.p. 98-98.5 °C. 

Note. (1) Silica gel PF 254-366 (Brinkmann) is used for the preparative layer 
chromatography. The editors suggest that the use of flash chromatography (Section 
2.31) could be explored in this case. 

6.2 AROMATIC NITRO COMPOUNDS 

The importance of aromatic nitro compounds arises in particular from the ready 
conversion of the nitro group into other functional groups, principally by routes 
involving initial reduction to the amino group. The following procedures, of 
which the first is by far the most important, are available for the synthesis of 
aromatic nitro compounds. 

1. Direct nitration (Expts 6.17 to 6.21). 

2. The oxidation of amines (Expt 6.22). 

3. The replacement of a diazo group by a nitro group (see Expt 6.78).

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The presence of a nitro group in a compound is readily recognised from its 
strong characteristic i.r. absorption frequencies (Fig. 3.38). The aromatic 
substitution pattern is less easily assigned by inspection of the longer wavelength 
region (p. 310). However, this may be frequently assessed by examination of the 
p.m.r. spectrum (Fig. 3.64, m-dinitrobenzene). Further examples are given in 
descriptive style in the preparative examples. The fragmentation pattern 
observed in the m.s. of a nitro compound is discussed on p. 855 and further 
illustrated in some of the preparations described below. The nitro group exerts a 
bathochromic shift on the aromatic absorption frequencies in the u.v.-visible 
spectrum (p. 392). 

6.2.1 DIRECT NITRATION 

Aromatic hydrocarbons may be nitrated, i.e. the hydrogen atoms replaced by 
nitro (N0 2 ) groups, with concentrated nitric acid in the presence of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid ('mixed acid reagent'). 

ArH + HN0 3 /H 2 S0 4 &gt;■ Ar-N0 2 

The function of the sulphuric acid is to convert the nitric acid into the highly 

reactive, electrophilic, nitro nium ion, N0 2 , which is the effective nitrating agent. 

HON0 2 + H 2 S0 4 &gt;■ N0 2 + H,0 + 2HSO? 

The mechanism of aromatic nitration, which is illustrated below in the case of 
benzene, is a two-step process involving electrophilic attack of the nitro nium ion 
on the benzene molecule to form the intermediate mesomeric ion (1), followed 
by removal of a proton by the hydrogen sulphate ion, which is the most basic 
species in the reaction mixture.

Nitration of aromatic hydrocarbons is usually carried out with the above 
mixed acid reagent at comparatively low temperatures (e.g. about 50 °C, as used 
in the preparation of nitrobenzene and 1-nitronaphthalene, Expt 6.17). Un- 
necessarily high temperatures should be avoided since polynitration is then 
more likely and oxidative breakdown of the aromatic ring system may occur. 

The nitration of substituted aromatic compounds (e.g. ArZ) presents a range 
of practical and theoretical problems which need to be briefly surveyed. These 
include: (a) the severity of the reaction conditions; (b) the sensitivity of the group 
Z to the oxidising conditions of the nitrating agents; (c) the regioselectivity of the 
reaction (i.e. the orientating influence of the group Z to either the meta or to the 
ortho/para positions); (d) the sequence of reactions (i.e. either to nitrate ArZ, or 
to introduce the substituent Z into the nitro compound ArN0 2 ); (e) the use 
of a disubstituted compound Z-C 6 H 4 *Y, wherein the orientating influence of Y 
predominates, and thus directs the nitro group to the desired position, but is 
then removed in a subsequent reaction step. 

Thus the nitration of aromatic compounds containing an electron-with- 
drawing group (e.g. — N0 2 , — S0 3 H, — CHO, — COR, — C0 2 H, — C0 2 R) 
does not occur readily under the above conditions, in which case forcing con- 
ditions which require the use of fuming nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric 
acid need to be employed. Nitrobenzene, for example, is converted by a mixture 
of fuming nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid into about 90 per cent 
of m-dinitrobenzene (Expt 6.18) and small amounts of the o- and p-isomers; 
the latter are eliminated in the process of recrystallisation. p-Nitro 
toluene is similarly converted largely into 2,4-dinitro toluene (Expt 6.18). A 
further example is the nitration of benzaldehyde to give m-nitrobenzaldehyde 
(Expt 6.19) in reasonable yield in spite of the fact that the reaction conditions are 
strongly oxidising. The nitro group is thus seen to be meta-directing in common 
with the other deactivating groups specified above. 

The deactivating effect of the nitro group is largely the result of its mesomeric 
interaction (-M effect) with the 7r-electron system of the benzene ring which is 
supplemented by the inductive (-/) effect (2). 




The overall electron withdrawal from the ring system results in the rate of attack 
of the nitronium ion being substantially retarded compared to benzene. 
Moreover, the representations of the canonical forms of nitrobenzene formu- 
lated above show that the ortho and para positions are subject to the greatest 
reduction in electron density. In addition the reaction intermediate resulting 

852 



AROMATIC COMPOUNOS 6.2 



from attack at a position para to the nitro group would be represented by the 
following hybrid species (similar formulations being possible as a result of ortho 
attack). 




(a) 





NO, 



(c) 



It follows that since (3(b)) is energetically unfavourable the mesomeric 
stabilisation of this intermediate is less than that of the corresponding 
intermediate resulting from attack in the meta position (4).

The nitration of aromatic compounds containing electron-releasing groups 
(e.g. — R, —OH, — NH 2 , — NHCOMe) needs to be conducted under 
conditions which are milder than those specified for benzene, since in these cases 
the aromatic nucleus is activated towards attack by the electrophilic species, and 
furthermore the ring system is more likely to be oxidatively cleaved. An example 
is provided by the nitration of acetanilide (Expt 6.68) to yield a mixture of o- and 
p-nitroacetanilides (see also Section 6.6.2, p. 916); the overall nitration of phenol 
to a mixture of o- and p-nitrophenols (Expt 6.102) is anomalous in that the 
reagent is dilute nitric acid alone; the mechanism is outlined in Section 6.9.2, p. 
975. These activating groups are therefore seen to be ortho and para directing. 
By contrast to the effect of electron-withdrawing groups, activating and 
ortho/para directing groups will stabilise by electron release the reaction 
intermediate formed as a result of attack at any of the three possible positions, 
but particularly so when attack is at the ortho and para positions. 

An interesting case is provided by the nitration of aryl halides where the effect 
of the halogen is to deactivate the aromatic nucleus (by the -/ effect) but to direct 
the incoming nitronium ion to the ortho and para positions as a result of the 
mesomeric interaction of the halogen lone electron pair with the charge 
developed in the corresponding intermediates [e.g. (5), in the formation of p- 
bromonitrobenzene from bromobenzene, Expt 6.20].

6.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 





Experimental details for the nitration of benzyl cyanide are also included 
(Expt 6.21). The product is largely p-nitrobenzyl cyanide (some of the ortho 
isomer is also formed): the cyanomethyl substituent (as a substituted alkyl 
group) is thus an ortho/para directing and weakly activating group. 

The electronic effect of groups in aromatic electrophilic substitution pro- 
cesses is fully discussed in all standard organic chemistry textbooks.

CAUTION: This preparation should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 
Place 50 g (35 ml, c. 0.5 mol) of concentrated nitric acid in a 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask, and add, in portions with shaking, 74 g (40 ml) of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid. Keep the mixture cool during the addition by 
immersing the flask in cold water. Place a thermometer (1 10 °C range) in the 
acid mixture. Introduce 26 g (30 ml, 0.33 mol) of benzene (CAUTION) in 
portions of 2-3 ml; shake the flask well, to ensure thorough mixing, after each 
addition of the benzene. Do not allow the temperature of the mixture to rise 
above 55 °C; immerse the flask, if necessary, in cold water or in ice-water. 
When all the benzene has been added, fit a reflux condenser to the flask and 
heat it in a water bath maintained at 60 °C (but not appreciably higher) for 
40-45 minutes; remove the flask from time to time from the bath and shake it 
vigorously to ensure good mixing of the immiscible layers. Pour the contents 
of the flask into about 500 ml of cold water in a beaker, stir the mixture well in 
order to wash out as much acid as possible from the nitrobenzene and allow 
to stand. When the nitrobenzene has settled to the bottom, pour off the acid 
liquor as completely as possible, and transfer the residual liquid to a 
separatory funnel. Run off the lower layer of nitrobenzene and reject the 
upper aqueous layer; return the nitrobenzene to the separatory funnel and 
shake it vigorously with about 50 ml of water. Separate the nitrobenzene as 
completely as possible and run it into a small conical flask containing about 
5 g of anhydrous calcium chloride. If the nitrobenzene does not become clear 
on shaking because of the presence of emulsified water, warm the mixture, 
with shaking, for a short period on a water bath; the cloudiness will soon 
disappear. Filter the cold product through a small fluted filter paper into a 
small (50- or 100-ml) distilling flask and attach a still-head and air condenser. 
Heat the flask on a ceramic-centred wire gauze or preferably in an air bath, 
and collect the fraction which boils at 206-21 1 °C (1). Do not distil quite to 
dryness nor allow the temperature to rise above 214 °C, for there may be a 
residue of m-dinitrobenzene and higher nitro compounds and an explosion 
may result. The yield of nitrobenzene is 35 g (85%). Pure nitrobenzene is a 
clear, pale yellow liquid, b.p. 210 °C.

spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) shows signals at 5 7.3-7.8 (m, 3H, C 3 , 4 , 5 — H) and a 
lower field signal at S 8.0-8.3 (m, 2H, C 2j6 — H). The m.s. reveals significant 
fragment ions at m/z 123 (M), 93 (M - NO), 77 (M - N0 2 ; base peak), and 
65 (93 - CO). 

Note. (1) Nitrobenzene (and many other liquid organic compounds containing 
nitrogen) is appreciably toxic and its vapour should not be allowed to escape into the 
atmosphere of the laboratory. Site the distillation apparatus in a fume cupboard, use 
the receiver assembly illustrated in Fig. 2.98, and attach to the outlet of the receiver 
adapter a piece of rubber tubing leading to the extraction system. The liquid is also a 
skin poison; if it is accidentally spilled on the skin, it should be removed by washing 
with a little methylated spirit, followed by soap and warm water. 

Cognate preparation. 1-Nitronaphthakne. Use 40 ml of concentrated nitric 
acid and 40 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid with 50 g (0.39 mol) of finely 
powdered naphthalene as detailed for nitrobenzene. The subsequent heating 
at 60 °C should be for 30-40 minutes or until the smell of naphthalene has 
disappeared. Pour the reaction mixture into 500 ml of water; decant the 
washings from the product and then boil the solid with 200 ml of water for 20 
minutes. Decant the water and subject the oil to steam distillation (Fig. 2.102) 
to remove unreacted naphthalene. Pour the warm residue into a large volume 
of water with vigorous stirring. Filter and recrystallise from dilute alcohol to 
give pure 1-nitronaphthalene (60 g, 89%), m.p. 61 °C.

Place 37.5g (21ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid and 22.5g (15ml) of 
fuming nitric acid, d 1.5, in a 250- or 500-ml round-bottomed flask; add a few 
fragments of unglazed porcelain. Attach a reflux condenser and place the 
apparatus in a fume cupboard. Add slowly, in portions of about 3 ml, 15 g 
(12.5 ml, 0.122mol) of nitrobenzene; after each addition, shake the flask to 
ensure thorough mixing. Heat the mixture, with frequent shaking, on a 
boiling water bath for 30 minutes. Allow the mixture to cool somewhat and 
pour it cautiously with vigorous stirring into about 500 ml of cold water; the 
dinitrobenzene soon solidifies. Filter with suction, wash thoroughly with cold 
water and allow to drain as completely as possible. 

Transfer the crude dinitrobenzene to a 250-ml flask fitted with a reflux 
condenser, add 80-100 ml of industrial (or rectified) spirit and heat on a water 
bath until all the crystalline solid dissolves. If the resulting solution is not 
quite clear, filter it through a fluted filter paper on a large funnel which has 
previously been warmed or through a warm Buchner funnel. Colourless 
crystals of m-dinitrobenzene (15 g, 73%) are deposited on cooling. If the m.p. 
is below 89-90 °C, recrystallisation is necessary. 

The i.r. absorption bands of the nitro group (KBr disc) should be noted at 
c. 1525 and 1340 cm" l (see Fig. 3.38). The p.m.r. is noted on p. 349 (cf. ortho 
and para isomers, both being noted on p. 942). The 13 C-n.m.r. spectrum 
shows signals at S 118.6, 128.8, 130.8 and 148.1. The m.s. shows significant 
fragment ions at m/z 168 (M), 122 (M - N0 2 ), 76 (M - 2N0 2 ), 92 
(M - [N0 2 + NO]), 64 (92 - CO), and 30 (NO®, base peak).

Cognate preparation. 2,4-Dinitrotoluene. Use 18 g (12 ml, c. 0.36 mol) of 
fuming nitric acid, d 1.5, and 30g (16.5 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in a 
two-necked flask (reflux condenser, stopper side-arm). Add, in small portions, 
14 g (0.1 mol) of p-nitrotoluene through the side-arm keeping the temperature 
below 50 °C. Heat the reaction mixture and isolate the product as described 
above. Recrystallise from methanol. The yield of pure 2,4-dinitrotoluene, m.p. 
71 °C, is 12.5 g (69%). The stretching vibrations of the nitro groups are clearly 
visible in the i.r. spectrum (KBr disc) at c. 1520 and 1340 cm" 1 . The p.m.r.

Place 250 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and 21.5 ml of fuming nitric acid, 
d 1.5, in a 500-ml two-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer (unsealed) 
and a dropping funnel. Stir and cool to 0°C in a bath of ice and salt. Add 
62.5 g (60 ml, 0.59 mol) of benzaldehyde (see Expt 6.133) dropwise from the 
dropping funnel; do not allow the temperature to rise above 5 °C. Then warm 
the mixture gradually to 40 °C, cool to room temperature and pour in a thin 
stream with vigorous stirring on to finely crushed ice. Filter through a 
sintered glass funnel, wash with a little water, press out the oil with a wide 
glass stopper and dry the solid in the air upon absorbent paper. The resulting 
crude m-nitrobenzaldehyde weighs 55 g and melts at 48-50 °C. Melt the crude 
solid under excess of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution, stir, cool, filter 
and dry in the air; the product has m.p. 51-52 °C. Dissolve the solid in 120 ml 
of hot toluene (water bath;/ume cupboard), decant from any solid present and 
add light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C, until a slight turbidity results and cool. 
Collect the pure m-nitrobenzaldehyde and dry in the air; the yield is 45 g 
(50%), m.p. 58 °C. 

Note the i.r. absorptions at c. 3 100 cm " l (C AR — H), c. 2800 cm " l (H— CO), 
and at c. 1700 cm" 1 (C=0), together with well-observed aromatic ring 
vibrations (at 1600, 1590, 1500 and 1450cm" 1 ) and the absorptions arising 
from the vibrations of the nitro group. The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) 
shows 5 7.85 (distorted t, 1H, C 4 — H), 8.2-8.9 (broad m, 3H, C 2 5 6 — H), and

Prepare a mixture of 28.5 g (20 ml) of concentrated nitric acid and 37 g (20 ml) 
of concentrated sulphuric acid in a 250-ml round-bottomed flask (see Expt 
6.17) and cool it to the laboratory temperature. Attach a reflux condenser to 
the flask. Add 16 g (10.5 ml, 0.1 mol) of bromobenzene (Expt 6.23) in portions 
of 2-3 ml during about 15 minutes; shake the flask vigorously during the 
whole process and do not allow the temperature to rise above 50-60 °C by 
cooling in running water, if necessary. When the temperature no longer tends 
to rise owing to the heat of reaction, heat the flask on a boiling water bath for 



856 



AROMATIC COMPOUNOS 6.2 



30 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature and pour the reaction 
mixture with stirring into 200 ml of cold water. Filter the bromonitrobenzene 
at the pump, wash well with cold water and finally drain as far as possible. 
Recrystallise from 100 to 125 ml of industrial spirit (flask, reflux condenser 
and water bath; see Expt 6.18). When cold, filter the almost pure p- 
bromonitrobenzene, m.p. 125 °C. The yield is 14 g (70%). The mother-liquor 
contains the o-bromonitrobenzene, contaminated with some of the p- 
isomeride. 

The para-substitution pattern is clearly revealed by the p.m.r. spectrum 
(CDC1 3 , TMS), which shows the characteristic pair of two-proton doublets, 
5 7.26 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to Br), and 8.03 (d, 2H, ortho-Ws to N0 2 ). 

Experiment 6.21 /^NITROBENZYL CYANIDE 

Ph-CH,-CN + HNO, -5Z?°1* p-0 2 N-C 6 H 4 -CH 2 -CN 

Place a mixture of 275 ml of concentrated nitric acid with an equal volume of 
concentrated sulphuric acid in a 2-litre three-necked flask, fitted with a 
thermometer, a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel and assembled in 
the fume cupboard. Cool the mixture to 10 °C in an ice bath, and run in 100 g 
(98 ml, 0.85 mol) of benzyl cyanide (Expt 5.157) at such a rate (about 1 hour) 
that the temperature remains at about 10 °C and does not rise above 20 °C. 
Remove the ice bath, stir the mixture for 1 hour and pour it on to 1200g of 
crushed ice. A pasty mass slowly separates; more than half of this is p- 
nitrobenzyl cyanide, the other components being the ortho isomeride and a 
variable amount of an oil. Filter the mass on a sintered glass funnel, press well 
to remove as much oil as possible and then dissolve in 500 ml of boiling 
rectified spirit. The p-nitrobenzyl cyanide crystallises on cooling. Filter this 
off at the pump and recrystallise from 80 per cent ethanol. The yield of p- 
nitrobenzyl cyanide, m.p. 115-116 °C, is 75 g (54%). Another recrystallisation 
raises the m.p. to 116-1 17 °C. 

The i.r. spectrum (KBr disc) shows absorptions at c. 3050 (C AR — H str.), c. 
2950 (C AL — H str.), 2250 (C=N str.), 1500 and 1380cm -1 (N0 2 str.). The 
para substitution is confirmed by the p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS), S 3.89 
(s, 2H, CH 2 ), 7.48 (d, 2H, C 2 , 6 — H), and 8.18 (d, 2H, C 3 , 5 — H). 

6.2.2 THE OXIDATION OF AMINES 

Various reagents are available for the oxidation of an aromatic amine to the 
corresponding nitro compound. For example, peroxymonosulphuric acid 
(Caro's acid) and other peroxyacids have been quite widely used in the past, 
although the yields of nitro compounds are rather variable owing to the 
concomitant formation of azoxycompounds. Pertrifluoroacetic acid is the 
reagent of choice since it generally gives improved yields of purer products; its 
use is illustrated by the conversion of p-toluidine into p-nitrotoluene (Expt 6.22). 
Further examples are the formation of o-chloronitrobenzene and 2,6-di- 
chloronitrobenzene from the corresponding primary amines. The method is not, 
however, generally suitable for amines having ring systems which are highly 
activated as the result, for example, of the presence of an alkoxy substituent.

6.2.3 THE REPLACEMENT OF A DIAZO GROUP BY A NITRO GROUP 

This replacement is achieved by the decomposition of the aryldiazonium 
fluoroborate with aqueous sodium nitrite in the presence of copper powder and 
is described in Expt 6.78. This procedure gives better yields and thus replaces the 
former method of reacting an acidic aryldiazonium salt solution with nitrous 
acid in the presence of copper(i) oxide.

CAUTION: This reaction should be carried out in a fume cupboard behind a 
safety screen. Adequate precautions should be observed in handling the 
hydrogen peroxide solution (Expt 5.190, Note (7)). 

Prepare a solution of pertrifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane as 
follows. Place 50 ml of dichloromethane in a two-necked, 250-ml round- 
bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. Insert a 
plastic-covered magnetic stirrer follower bar, and cool the flask in an ice bath 
sited on the stirrer unit. To the cooled and stirred solution add 3.5 ml 
(0.12mol) of 85 per cent hydrogen peroxide and then 22.7 ml (33.9 g, 
0.14mol) of trifluoroacetic anhydride. Stir for 5 minutes after the addition is 
completed and then allow the solution to warm to room temperature. To this 
stirred solution add over 15 minutes a solution of 3.2 g (0.03 mol) of p- 
toluidine in 10 ml of dichloromethane. The reaction is exothermic but no 
cooling is necessary in this case. When the addition is complete heat the 
solution under reflux on the water bath for 1 hour. Cool, wash the 
dichloromethane solution with two 100 ml portions of water, dry (MgS0 4 ) 
and remove the solvent on a rotary evaporator to obtain p-nitrotoluene, 2.9 g 
(71%), having m.p. c. 49 °C. Recrystallisation from a small volume of ethanol 
gives a purer product, m.p. 51-52 °C. 

In the i.r. spectrum (KBr disc) note absorptions at c. 1555 and 1355 cm" 1 
(N0 2 str.). The para substitution is confirmed by the p.m.r. spectrum 
(CDC1 3 , TMS) which shows 8 2.45 (s, 3H, Me), 7.30 (d, 2H, C 2 . 6 — H), and 
8.10 (d, 2H, C 3 5 — H). The m.s. reveals principal fragment ions at m/z 137 
(M), 107 (M -NO), 91 (M - N0 2 , base peak), 79 (107 - CO), and 77 
(79 - H 2 ). 



6.3 AROMATIC HALOGEN COMPOUNDS 

The compounds described and discussed below are those in which the halogen is 
directly attached to the aromatic nucleus (e.g. C 6 H 5 C1, or PhCl, chlorobenzene) 
and those in which the halogen is substituted into an alkyl side chain (e.g. 
C 6 H 5 -CH 2 C1, or Ph-CH 2 C1, benzyl chloride). 

The following procedures are available for the preparation of aromatic 
halogen compounds. 

1. Direct halogenation by (a) substitution in the nucleus, and (b) substitution in 
the side chain (Expts 6.23 to 6.28).

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The i.r. spectrum of an aromatic halogen compound shows the expected 
absorptions due to the aromatic nucleus and strong absorption in the longer 
wavelength region due to the stretching of the C — X bond (p. 316). The p.m.r. 
spectrum and the m.s. are more useful for definitive structural characterisation. 
The former may frequently enable the substitution pattern to be assigned; 
examples are to be found in the preparative accounts below. By virtue of the 

859 



6.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



natural isotope ratios of bromine and chlorine (p. 366) the m.s. often enables the 
various possible combinations in mono- and poly-halogenated compounds to 
be assessed (see for example bromobenzene and p-dibromobenzene, Expt 6.23; 
p-bromochlorobenzene, Expt 6.30; 2,4,6-tribromoaniline Expt 6.59). The u.v- 
visible spectrum is not sufficiently informative to be of value in structural 
assignments. 



6.3.1 DIRECT HALOGENATION 

NUCLEAR SUBSTITUTION 

Benzene does not react appreciably with chlorine and bromine in the cold, but in 
the presence of catalysts, such as aluminium amalgam, pyridine or iron, reaction 
takes place readily, affording in the first instance the mono-halogenated 
derivative as the main product. Di-substituted products (largely the para 
isomer) are obtained if the proportion of the halogen is increased. A typical 
procedure is given in the preparation of bromobenzene (Expt 6.23). The function 
of the catalyst is to increase the electrophilic activity of the halogen and the 
mechanism of the bromination of benzene with pyridine as the catalyst can be 
represented by the following scheme (cf. the nitration of benzene, Section 6.2.1, 
p. 851).

Since iodine is the least reactive of the halogens, iodination does not occur 
unless the reaction is carried out in the presence of an oxidising agent. When 
using fuming nitric acid, the nature of the electrophile which functions as the I® 
donor is thought to be [0=N(I)OH] e . 10 More recently a procedure has been 
reported using copper(n) chloride as the source of oxidant in the presence of 
aluminium chloride. 11 Both methods give good yields of iodobenzene (Expt 
6.24), but the latter method is more suitable for the iodination of alkylbenzenes 
(e.g. p-xylene, which gives a good yield of 2-iodo-l,4-dimethyl benzene). Benzene 
derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups are not iodinated under these 
conditions. 

Condensed aromatic hydrocarbons are more reactive towards electrophilic 
reagents, and naphthalene, for example, may be brominated quite readily in 
solution in carbon tetrachloride without the need for a catalyst; electrophilic 
attack takes place at the more reactive a-position to yield 1-bromonaphthalene 
(Expt 6.25). 

The effects of substituents in electrophilic aromatic substitution processes, 



860 



AROMATIC COMPOUNOS 6.3 



which are outlined in Section 6.2.1, p. 852, are further illustrated here with 
reference to the bromination of nitrobenzene, where a substantially higher 
reaction temperature is required (the nitro group is deactivating) and the 
product is predominantly m-bromonitrobenzene (Expt 6.26). Nitration of an 
aryl halide gives a mixture of o- and p-halonitrobenzenes (Expt 6.20). 

SIDE-CHAIN HALOGENATION 

In the absence of catalysts, treatment of toluene with chlorine (or bromine) at 
the boiling point, preferably with exposure to sunlight or other bright light 
source, results in halogenation in the side chain. The introduction of the first 
chlorine atom, for example, proceeds at a much faster rate than the introduction 
of the second chlorine atom so that in practice the major portion of the toluene 
is converted into benzyl chloride (1) before appreciable chlorination of benzyl 
chloride occurs to give benzylidene chloride (2) and benzotrichloride (3).

Rapid side-chain chlorination of toluene proceeds in the dark with sulphuryl 
chloride in the presence of benzoyl peroxide (0.001-0.005 mol per mol of 
S0 2 C1 2 ) as catalyst (Expt 6.27). With an excess of sulphuryl chloride, benzylidene 
chloride is formed, but in this case chlorination does not proceed beyond this 
stage. 

Side-chain halogenation is illustrated also by the bromination of p- 
nitrotoluene (Expt 6.28). The radical mechanism with molecular bromine is 
similar to that of chlorination above; Af-bromosuccinimide has also found use as 
a side-chain brominating reagent and its application is described in Expts 6.1 19 
and 6.152. 

Experiment 6.23 BROMOBENZENE 

PhH + Br 2 -2*^ C 6 H 5 Br 

This preparation should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 

Place 50 g (57 ml, 0.64 mol) of dry benzene (CAUTION) and 0.5 ml of dry 
pyridine (1) (dried over potassium hydroxide pellets) in a 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask. Attach a reflux condenser to the flask and fit a device for 
absorbing the hydrogen bromide gas subsequently evolved (Fig. 2.61(a)). 
Partially immerse the flask in a bath of cold water, supported upon a tripod 
and gauze. Carefully pour 125 g (40 ml) of bromine (for precautions to be 
taken with bromine, see Section 4.2.9, p. 422) through the condenser and 
immediately insert the absorption device into the upper end of the condenser. 
A vigorous reaction soon occurs and hydrogen bromide is evolved which is 
absorbed by the water in the beaker; when the reaction slackens, warm the 
bath to 25-30 °C for 1 hour. Finally raise the temperature of the bath to 65- 

861 



6.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



70 °C for a further 45 minutes or until all the bromine has disappeared (no red 
vapours visible) and the evolution of hydrogen bromide has almost ceased. 
Transfer the dark-coloured reaction product to a separatory funnel and 
shake successively with water, with sufficient 5-10 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution to ensure that the washings are alkaline to litmus, and finally with 
water. Dry with magnesium sulphate or anhydrous calcium chloride. Filter 
through a fluted filter paper into a small distilling flask and distil slowly. 
Collect the crude bromobenzene at 150-170 °C; pour the residue while still 
hot into a small porcelain basin. Redistil the liquid of b.p. 150-170 °C (2) and 
collect the bromobenzene at 154-157 °C; the yield is about 60 g (60%). 

In the i.r. spectrum (thin film) note absorptions at c. 3050 cm " 1 (C AR — H, 
stretching), and at 1600, 1590, 1500 and 1450 cm" 1 (ring-breathing vibra- 
tions). The p.m.r. spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) shows two complex signals at 
5 7.13 (m, 3H, C 3 , 4 , 5 — H) and at 7.41 (m, 2H, C 2 ,e— H). The presence of 
bromine is clearly revealed in the m.s. which shows principal fragment ions at 
158 (M, 81 Br) and 156 (M, 79 Br) of nearly equal intensity, and at 77 (M - Br, 
base peak) and 51 (77 - C 2 H 2 ). 

Isolate the pure p-dibromobenzene from the residue in the basin by 
recrystallisation from hot ethanol with the addition of 1-2 g of decolourising 
charcoal; use about 4 ml of ethanol (industrial spirit) for each gram of 
material. Filter the hot solution through a fluted filter paper, cool in ice and 
filter the crystals at the pump. The yield of p-dibromobenzene, m.p. 89 °C, is 
about 12 g. 

The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) shows a sharp signal at 3 7.29 (s, 4H, 
C AR — H) characteristic of an A 4 aromatic substitution pattern. The m.s. shows 
the typical molecular ion cluster due to the presence of two bromine atoms (p. 
366), namely, m/z 238 (RA 48.8%), 236 (RA 100%) and 234 (RA 51.4%); the 
other ions are observable at m/z 157 (C 6 H 4 81 Br), 155 (C 6 H 4 79 Br), 75 
(157 - H 81 Br, and 155 - H 79 Br), 76 (157 - 81 Br and 155 - 79 Br) and 50 
(76-C 2 H 2 ). 

Notes. (1) Other halogen carriers may be used, e.g. 1-2 g of iron filings, or 1 g of 
aluminium amalgam. The bromine must then be added slowly from a dropping funnel 
to the benzene warmed on a water bath; a suitable two- or three-necked flask should 
be used. After all the bromine has been introduced, the mixture is heated on a water 
bath until no red vapours are visible above the liquid. The subsequent procedure is as 
above. 

(2) The best results are obtained by distillation from a small flask through a short 
fractionating column: a Hempel column filled with glass rings (Fig. 2.105(c)) and 
lagged with several thicknesses of linen cloth is quite satisfactory.

This preparation should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a reflux condenser, a sealed 
mechanical stirrer and separatory funnel, and support it on a water bath. 
Attach an absorption device (Fig. 2.61) to the top of the condenser. Place 
1 34 g ( 1 52 ml, 1 .72 mol) of benzene (CAUTION) and 1 27 g (0.5 mol) of iodine 
in the flask, and heat the water bath to about 50 °C; add 92 ml of fuming nitric 
acid, d 1.50, slowly from the separatory funnel during 30 minutes (1). Oxides

of nitrogen are evolved in quantity. The temperature rises slowly without the 
application of heat until the mixture boils gently. When all the nitric acid has 
been introduced, reflux the mixture gently for 15 minutes. If iodine is still 
present, add more nitric acid to the warm solution until the purple colour 
(due to iodine) changes to brownish-red. 

Separate the lower oily layer, mix with it an equal volume of 10 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution and steam distil from a 1 -litre flask until no more 
oil passes over. A yellow solid, consisting of nitro compounds, may collect 
towards the end of the distillation; remove this by mechanical stirring of the 
oil for about 3 hours with 7 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 100 ml of 
water and 70 g of iron filings in a 1 -litre three-necked flask connected with a 
reflux condenser. Allow the mixture to cool and filter. Render the filtrate 
distinctly acid to Congo red with hydrochloric acid and again steam distil. 
Separate the oil, dry it with anhydrous calcium chloride or magnesium 
sulphate, distil through a suitably lagged fractionating column and collect the 
fraction of b.p. 180-190 °C. Upon redistillation, pure iodobenzene, b.p. 184— 
186 °C, is obtained. The yield is 180 g (87%). 

Note. (1) In an alternative procedure, 1 1 iodine (3.8 g, 15 mmol) is dissolved in benzene 
(50 ml), to this solution is added a mixture of anhydrous aluminium chloride (4.0 g, 
30 mmol) and copper(n) chloride (4.0 g, 30 mmol) previously dried at 120°C/3mmHg 
for more than 3 hours. The mixture is stirred at 40 °C for 2 hours, and then poured 
into water. The organic layer is washed with aqueous sodium hydrogen sulphite, dried 
and fractionally distilled. The yield of iodobenzene is 79 per cent. 

Experiment 6.25 1-BROMONAPHTHALENE 

C 10 H 8 + Br 2 -^&gt; l-C 10 H 7 Br + HBr 

Use a 500-ml three-necked flask equipped as in Expt 6.26 but mounted on a 
water bath. Place 128 g (lmol) of naphthalene and 45 ml of dry carbon 
tetrachloride in the flask, and 1 77 g (55 ml, 1.11 mol) of bromine (CAUTION) 
in the separatory funnel. Heat the mixture to gentle boiling and run in the 
bromine at such a rate that little, if any, of it is carried over with the hydrogen 
bromide into the trap; this requires about 3 hours. Warm gently, with stirring, 
for a further 2 hours or until the evolution of hydrogen bromide ceases. 
Replace the reflux condenser by a condenser set for downward distillation, 
stir and distil off the carbon tetrachloride as completely as possible. Mix the 
residue with 8 g of sodium hydroxide pellets and stir at 90-100 °C for 3 hours; 
this treatment will remove impurities which gradually evolve hydrogen 
bromide. Distil the product under diminished pressure and collect the 
following fractions: (i) up to 131 °C/12mmHg (or 144°C/20mmHg); (ii) 132- 
135°C/12mmHg (or 145-148 °C/20mmHg); and (iii) above 135 °C/ 
12mmHg (or 148°C/20mmHg). Fraction (ii) is almost pure 1-bromo- 
naphthalene. Fraction (i) contains unchanged naphthalene, while (iii) con- 
tains dibromonaphthalene. Cool fraction (i) in ice when most of the naph- 
thalene will crystallise out; filter this off on a sintered glass funnel, combine 
the filtrate with fraction (iii), redistil and collect the 1-bromonaphthalene 
fraction separately. The total yield of colourless product is 150g (72.5%).

Equip a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a separatory funnel, a sealed 
mechanical stirrer (1) and a double surface reflux condenser carrying an 
outlet tube connected to a gas trap (Fig. 2.62). Support the flask in an oil 
bath. Place 90 g (75 ml, 0.73 mol) of dry, freshly distilled nitrobenzene in the 
flask. Weigh out 10 g of pure iron powder (95%) 'reduced by hydrogen'. Heat 
the oil bath to 135-145 °C and introduce 3g of the iron powder by 
temporarily removing the separatory funnel. Into the latter place 62.5 g 
(20ml, 1.17mol) of dry bromine (CAUTION) (Section 4.2.9, p. 422) and run 
it into the flask at such a rate that bromine vapours do not rise appreciably in 
the condenser (c. 20 minutes). Continue stirring and heating for 1 hour 
before adding a further 3 g of iron powder and 20 ml of dry bromine in a 
similar manner. Stir for a further hour, add another 3 g of iron powder and 
20ml of bromine. When there is no more bromine vapour in the condenser, 
make a final addition of 1 g of iron powder and heat for 1 hour longer. 

Pour the resulting dark reddish-brown liquid into 500 ml of water to 
which 17 ml of saturated sodium metabisulphite solution has been added (the 
latter to remove the excess of bromine). Steam distil the resulting mixture 
(Fig. 2.102); collect the first portion of the distillate, which contains a little 
unchanged nitrobenzene, separately. Collect about 4 litres of distillate. Filter 
the yellow crystalline solid at the pump, and press well to remove the 
adhering liquid. The resulting crude m-bromonitrobenzene, m.p. 51-52 °C, 
weighs HOg (74%). If required pure, distil under reduced pressure (Section 
2.27) and collect the fraction of b.p. 117-1 18 °C/9mmHg; it then melts at 
56 °C and the recovery is about 85 per cent. 

Note. (1) Mechanical stirring, although not essential and replaceable by occasional 
shaking by hand, is advantageous.

In an efficient fume cupboard attach a double surface condenser to a 500-ml 
round-bottomed flask containing 92 g (106 ml, 1 mol) of toluene, 68 g (41 ml, 
0.5 mol) of redistilled sulphuryl chloride and 1 g of benzoyl peroxide (Section 
4.2.6, p. 417). Reflux gently and remove the heat source if necessary to 
moderate the vigorous reaction which takes place. The reaction is complete in 
30 minutes. Distil the reaction mixture using a fractionating column, first 
under atmospheric pressure until the temperature reaches 135-140 °C, and 
continue the distillation under diminished pressure collecting the benzyl 
chloride at 64-69°C/12mmHg (1). The latter on redistillation boils at 63- 
65°C/12mmHg. The yield of benzyl chloride is 50 g (79%). 

Note. (1) The benzyl chloride may also be isolated by distillation under atmospheric 
pressure. The material boiling between 165 and 185 °C is collected and redistilled; the 
final product is collected at 1 78-182 °C (pure benzyl chloride has b.p. 179 °C). The 
resulting benzyl chloride is, however, of lower purity unless an efficient fractionating 
column is used.

Place 150g (1.1 mol) of p-nitrotoluene, m.p. 51-52 °C, in a 500-ml three- 
necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, a sealed mechanical stirrer and a 
separatory funnel with stem reaching nearly to the bottom of the flask. Attach 
a gas absorption trap (Fig. 2.62) to the top of the condenser; the whole 
essembly should be sited in a fume cupboard. Heat the flask in an oil bath at 
145-1 50 °C and add 184g (59 ml, 1.15 mol) of bromine during 2 hours (1). 
Continue the stirring for an additional 10 minutes after all the bromine has 
been added. Pour the contents of the flask while still liquid (CAUTION) (2) 
into a 2.5-litre round-bottomed flask containing 2 litres of hot light 
petroleum, b.p. 80-100 °C, and 8g of decolourising carbon. Attach a reflux 
condenser to the flask, heat it with the aid of a heating mantle until the 
material dissolves, boil for 10 minutes and filter rapidly through a pre-heated 
Buchner funnel. Cool the filtrate to 20 °C, filter the crystals with suction, press 
well and wash with two 25 ml portions of cold light petroleum. The crude p- 
nitrobenzyl bromide, m.p. 95-97 °C (150 g), is sufficiently pure for many 
purposes. Purify by dissolving in 1 500-1 700 ml of light petroleum, b.p. 80- 
100 °C, boil with 8g of decolourising carbon, and filter through a preheated 
Buchner or sintered glass funnel. Cool the filtrate in ice, filter at the pump, 
drain well and wash with two 15 ml portions of cold light petroleum. The 
yield of pure p-nitrobenzyl bromide (pale yellow crystals, m.p. 98-99 °C) is 
135g(57%). 

Structural characterisation is confirmed by the p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , 
TMS) which shows signals at 3 4.51 (s, 2H, CH 2 ), 7.57 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to 
CH 2 Br) and 8.18 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to N0 2 ). In the i.r. spectrum the 
absorption due to the nitro group (c. 1340 and 1550cm" 1 ) is clearly visible. 

Notes. (1) Improved yields may be obtained by exposing the flask to the light of two 
300-watt tungsten lamps during the bromination. 

(2) Care must be taken in manipulating the lachrymatory solutions of p-nitrobenzyl 
bromide. If the substance should come into contact with the skin, bathe the affected 
part with alcohol. 

6.3.2 CHLOROMETHYLATION 

This is the replacement of a hydrogen atom in an aromatic compound by a 
chloromethyl (CH 2 C1) group in a single operation. The original classical 
reaction consists essentially of the interaction of formaldehyde and hydrogen 
chloride in the presence of a catalyst such as zinc chloride or aluminium chloride 
with an aromatic system (Blanc chloromethylation reaction). The reaction is 
similar in some respects to that of Friedel and Crafts (see Sections 6.1.1, p. 828, 
and 6.11.1, p. 1006) and involves the hydroxymethyl cation as the electrophilic 
species. This reacts with the aromatic ring to give the benzylic alcohol which is 
then converted into the chloromethyl derivative by hydrogen chloride.

865 



6.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



However, it has been found that a by-product arising from the interaction of 
formaldehyde and hydrogen chloride is bis(chloromethyl)ether (BCME), which is 
a potent carcinogen. For this reason the classical chloromethylation route to 
side-chain halogenated products should not be regarded as a desirable synthetic 
procedure, and in general should only be used if the required compound cannot 
be readily prepared by other methods. When used, effective precautions should 
be taken during the reaction and in the disposal of the reaction residues. 12 ' 13 
Recently two alternative procedures have been described. In one case 14 
methoxyacetyl chloride (MeOCH 2 *COCl) in the presence of anhydrous alum- 
inium chloride is thought to provide the source of the cation (4), which 
substitutes in the aromatic nucleus to give the benzyl methyl ether (5), which is 
subsequently converted into the chloromethylated product (6).

(5) (6) 

A wide range of substituted aromatic systems have been chloromethylated by 
this procedure, the only disadvantage being the expense of the methoxyacetyl 
chloride. 

In the second alternative method a two-step procedure has been described. 1 5 
The first step involves amidomethylation of the aromatic nucleus by reaction 
with paraformaldehyde and acetamide in the presence of concentrated sulphuric 
acid. The isolated intermediate is then treated with phosphorus oxychloride in 
dimethylformamide and xylene and converted into the chloromethylated 
product [e.g. see 2-(chloromethyl)-4-nitrotoluene, Expt 6.29, for formulation]. 
The mechanisms of these reactions are currently only speculative.

product [CAUTION (1)] which after recrystallation from hexane has m.p.

Note. (1) This compound is lachrymatory and may be a skin irritant. 

6.3.3 THE REPLACEMENT OF A DIAZO GROUP BY A HALOGEN 

The most generally applicable route to nuclear substituted aromatic halogen 
compounds involves decomposition of a diazonium salt under suitable con- 
ditions. These reactions are discussed in Section 6.7.1, p. 922. 

6.3.4 THE REPLACEMENT OF A HYDROXYL GROUP BY A HALOGEN 

Replacement of the hydroxyl group in a phenol by halogen cannot be 
accomplished by reaction with the hydrogen halides as in the case of alcohols, 
and reaction with phosphorus halides gives only low yields of halogenobenzenes 
(except in the case of nitrophenols), the main product being a phosphite or 
phosphate ester. 

ArOH + PC1 3 &gt; (ArO) 3 P + 3HC1 

However, if the phenol is first treated with the complex formed from 
triphenylphosphine and a halogen in acetonitrile solution, an 
aryloxytriphenylphosphonium halide is formed which on thermal decompo- 
sition yields the aryl halide in good yield (e.g. the preparation of p- 
bromochlorobenzene, Expt 6.30).

Equip a 250-ml three-necked round-bottomed flask with a reflux conden-

and a sealed stirrer unit. In the flask place 29 g (0. 1 1 mol) of finely powdered 
triphenylphosphine and 100ml of dry acetonitrile (Section 4.1.27, p. 410). 
Cool the flask in an ice-water bath and add with stirring over a period of 20 
minutes 17.3g (5.5ml, 0.108 mol) of bromine. After the addition is complete 
remove the cooling bath, set the condenser for downward distillation and 

867 



6.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



replace the dropping funnel with a stopper. Remove the acetonitrile under 
reduced pressure using a water pump; warm the flask to 40 °C on a water 
bath and use an oil pump to remove last traces of solvent. Add lOg 
(0.078 mol) of redistilled, powdered p-chlorophenol to the solid residue, 
replace the condenser (together with its guard-tube) in the reflux position and 
site the flask on a sand bath. Raise the temperature of the sand bath to 
between 250 and 280 °C and slowly stir the contents of the flask which soon 
melt; hydrogen bromide is evolved over a period of 3 hours. When evolution 
of gas ceases, cool the residue, add water and steam distil. Collect the solid p- 
bromochlorobenzene by filtration of the distillate; it has m.p. 63-65 °C. 
Recrystallise from ethanol to obtain the pure product, m.p. 65-66 °C; the 
yield is 12.5 g (83%). 

The p.m.r. spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) shows a pair of doublets characteristic 
of para substitution at 3 7.13 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to CI) and at 7.37 (d, 2H, ortho- 
H's to Br). The m.s. provides an excellent illustration of the isotope 
combinations of chlorine and bromine (p. 366); principal fragment ions are at 
m/z 194 (M, 81 Br 37 Cl, RA 23.6%), 192 (M, 81 Br 35 Cl and 79 Br 37 Cl, RA 
100%), 190 (M, 79 Br 35 Cl, RA 76.1%), 113 (194 - 81 Br, 192 - 79 Br), 111 
(192 - 81 Br, 190 - 79 Br) and 75 (113 - H 37 C1, 111 - H 35 C1). 

6.3.5 METHODS LEADING TO POLYVALENT IODINE COMPOUNDS 

Aryl iodides are exceptional among the aromatic halogen compounds in that 
they form a series of derivatives in which the iodine exhibits a covalency greater 
than one. Some typical interconversions for which experimental conditions are 
given (Expts 6.31 to 6.36) are summarised below.

Two polyvalent iodine compounds arising from o-iodobenzoic acid have 
been found to be useful synthetic reagents. Thus oxidation of the iodo acid (7) 
with potassium persulphate, followed by the addition of benzene and treatment

diphenyliodonium-2-carboxylate [DPIC (9)] with aqueous alkali (Expt 6.35). 16

DIPC has been used as a benzyne precursor 17 into which it decomposes at 160- 
220 °C. At lower temperatures (80-100 °C) and in the presence of copper(n) 
acetate, it reacts with amino and phenolic nucleophiles to give ort/io-substituted 
benzoic acids. 16 

The periodinane (10) may also be prepared from o-iodobenzoic acid by 
oxidation with potassium bromate and then treatment with acetic anhydride 183 
(see Expt 6.36 for detailed formulation). It should be noted that the organic 
derivatives of pentacoordinate iodine(v) are termed periodinanes. 18b This 
compound (the systematic name is l,l,l-triacetoxy-2,l-benzoxiodol-3(3//)-one) 
has found use as an oxidant of primary alcohols to aldehydes and alicyclic 
ketones to secondary alcohols; it is claimed to have advantages over the 
chromium-based oxidation reagents.

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a mechanical stirrer, an adjustable 
inlet tube at least 10 mm in diameter for the introduction of chlorine (see 
Section 4.2.75, p. 424) and an outlet tube carrying a calcium chloride guard- 
tube. Charge the flask with 75 ml of chloroform (dried with anhydrous 
calcium chloride: see Section 4.1.6, p. 399) (CAUTION) and 51 g (0.25 mol) of 
iodobenzene (Expt 6.24); adjust the inlet tube so that it terminates about 
5 mm above the surface of the liquid. Set up the apparatus in the fume 
cupboard and protect it from the light. Cool the flask in an ice-salt mixture 
and pass in dry chlorine as rapidly as the solution will absorb it until an 
excess is present (1.5-2 hours). Filter the yellow, crystalline iodobenzene 
dichloride at the pump, wash it sparingly with chloroform and dry it in the air 
upon filter paper. The yield is 65 g (93.5%). The substance decomposes slowly 
upon standing; it may be kept unchanged for a short period in a well-fitting, 
ground glass stoppered bottle.

Cool a large glass mortar in ice and then place in it 50 g of anhydrous sodium 
carbonate, 55 g (0.2 mol) of iodobenzene dichloride (Expt 6.31) and lOOg of 
finely crushed ice. Grind the mixture thoroughly until all the ice has melted 
and a thick paste results. Add 140ml of 5m sodium hydroxide in 20ml 
portions and triturate vigorously after each addition; finally add 120 ml of 
water and allow to stand overnight. Filter with suction, press well with a large 
flat glass stopper on the filter, transfer to a beaker and stir with 300 ml of 
water (1). Filter again at the pump, transfer again to a beaker containing 
300 ml of water, filter and wash with about 200 ml of water on the filter. Dry 
in the air upon filter papers, stir with a little chloroform (to dissolve a little 
iodobenzene which is present), filter with suction and dry on filter paper in 
the air. The yield is 27 g (61%). 

Iodosobenzene explodes violently at about 220 °C, so that determinations 
of the melting point should not be attempted. It may, however, be converted 
into iodobenzene diacetate in the following manner. Dissolve 2 g of iodoso- 
benzene in 6 ml of glacial acetic acid; boiling is usually necessary. Cool. The 
resulting diacetate is readily soluble in acetic acid but is insoluble in ether. 
Add about 50 ml of ether in order to precipitate the iodobenzene diacetate. 
Filter and wash with ether. The yield is 2g, m.p. 157 °C. It may be 
recrystallised from benzene, and will keep indefinitely (unlike the iodoben- 
zene dichloride). 

Note. (1) The filtrate contains some diphenyliodonium salts; these may be recovered 
as the sparingly soluble diphenyliodonium iodide (about 8g) (Expt 6.34) by the 
addition of potassium iodide.

with water (1). Steam distil until almost all the iodobenzene has been 
removed (about 9 g); cool the residue in the flask at once, filter the white solid 
with suction and dry in the air. Wash it with a little chloroform, filter with 
suction and dry in the air upon filter paper. The yield is 10.5 g (89%). It may 
be recrystallised from 800-900 ml of water. Iodylbenzene melts with explosive 
decomposition at 237 °C. 

Note. (1) Iodosylbenzene when heated directly may decompose with explosive 
violence, particularly when dry.

stirred for 3.6 hours. Cooling to 0°C, filtering, and washing with 1000 ml of 
water and two 50-ml portions of ethanol give the product (89.1 g, 93%).

0.089 mol) in acetic anhydride (84.0 g, 0.83 mol) and acetic acid (70 ml) is 
heated to 100 °C. After 40 minutes the solid will dissolve. The solvent is 
removed under vacuum at room temperature until a thick slurry remains.

Filtering the slurry in an inert atmosphere and washing with 180 ml of ether

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The strong characteristic i.r. absorption of the S0 2 (or SO) group exhibited by 
all these compounds is clearly apparent in the spectrum of toluene-p- 
sulphonamide (Fig. 3.40). In addition, the absorption arising from the presence 
of the OH, CI, NH 2 or OR groups is usually easily assigned. The confirmation of 
aromatic substitution patterns by inspection of the p.m.r. spectra is described in 
the preparative examples below, wherein the fragmentation patterns observable 
in the m.s. are also discussed. 

6.4.1 DIRECT SULPHONATION 

Aromatic hydrocarbons may be monosulphonated by heating with a slight 
excess of concentrated sulphuric acid; for benzene, oleum (7-8% S0 3 ) gives 
somewhat better results. The reaction is usually complete when all the 
hydrocarbon has dissolved. 

ArH + H 2 S0 4 ?=± Ar-S0 3 H + H 2 

The mechanism of aromatic sulphonation is broadly analogous to that 
previously described for aromatic nitration and halogenation and may be 
represented in the following way, the neutral sulphur trioxide molecule 
functioning as the electrophilic species. Sulphonation differs from nitration and 
halogenation, however, in that the overall reaction is reversible.

Because of their high solubility in water the sulphonic acids are not usually 
isolated from aqueous solution in the free state, but are converted into and 
isolated as their sodium salts. The simplest procedure is to partially neutralise 
the reaction mixture (say, with sodium hydrogen carbonate) and then to pour it 
into water and add an excess of sodium chloride, when the following equilibrium 
is established. 

Ar-S0 3 H + NaCl ;==^ Ar-S0 3 Na + HC1 

The high sodium ion concentration results in crystallisation of the sodium salt. 
This process of salting out with common salt may be used for recrystallisation, 
but, for example, sodium benzenesulphonate (and salts of other acids of 
comparable molecular weight) is so very soluble in water that the solution 

873 



6.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



must be almost saturated with sodium chloride, and consequently the product is 
likely to be contaminated with it. In such a case a pure product may be obtained 
by crystallisation from, or Soxhlet extraction with, absolute ethanol; the 
inorganic salts are almost insoluble, but the sulphonate salt is slightly soluble 
and may be recovered by evaporation of the ethanol. Very small amounts of 
sulphones are formed as by-products, but since these are insoluble in water, they 
separate when the reaction mixture is poured into water. 

Ar-S0 3 H + ArH »• Ar-S0 2 -Ar + H 2 

The sulphonation of toluene (Expt 6.37) with concentrated sulphuric acid at 
100-120 °C results in the formation of toluene-p-sulphonic acid as the chief 
product, accompanied by small amounts of the ortho and meta isomers; these are 
easily removed by crystallisation of the sodium salt of the para isomer in the 
presence of sodium chloride. Sulphonation of naphthalene at about 160°C 
yields largely the 2-sulphonic acid (the product of thermodynamic control) 
(Expt 6.38); at lower temperatures (0-60 °C) the 1-sulphonic acid (the product of 
kinetic control) is produced almost exclusively. In both cases the product is 
isolated as its sodium salt. In anthraquinone the carbonyl groups deactivate the 
aromatic nucleus towards electrophilic attack and vigorous conditions of 
sulphonation are required, i.e. oleum at about 160 °C. The product is largely 
sodium anthraquinone-2-sulphonate (Expt 6.39). 

The free sulphonic acids [e.g. toluene-p-sulphonic acid, for preparation see, 
Expt 6.37, Note (1)], as opposed to their sodium salts, may sometimes be 
obtained directly if the sulphonation reaction is carried out with continuous 
removal of the water formed in the reaction, conveniently by using a Dean and 
Stark water separator. p-Xylene-2-sulphonic acid (Expt 6.40) is an example of a 
sulphonic acid whose solubility in water is such that it crystallises directly from 
the reaction medium and hence it may readily be isolated. 

Examples of the sulphonation of functionally substituted aromatic com- 
pounds are given in Expt 6.37, cognate preparation of sodium p- 
bromobenzenesulphonate; Expt 6.63, sulphanilic acid; and Expt 6.104, as an 
intermediate in the preparation of 2-nitroresorcinol.

Into a 500-ml three-necked flask, provided with a sealed mechanical stirrer 
and a reflux condenser, place 60 g (69 ml, 0.65 mol) of pure toluene (Section 
4.1J, p. 398) and 60g (33ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid. Heat the 
mixture, with stirring, in an oil bath maintained at 1 10-120 °C. When the 
toluene layer has disappeared (c. 1 hour), allow the reaction mixture to cool 
to room temperature. Pour it with stirring into 250 ml of cold water; filter 
from any solid substance which may separate. Partly neutralise the acid 
solution by adding cautiously and in small portions 30 g of sodium hydrogen 
carbonate. Heat the solution to boiling and saturate it with sodium chloride 
(about 100 g of salt are required), filter hot through a hot water funnel, or 
through a Buchner funnel previously warmed to about 100 °C. Transfer the 
hot filtrate to a beaker and cool the solution, with stirring, in ice. Filter the 

874 



AROMATIC COMPOUNOS 6.4 



crystals at the pump (rinse any residual crystals out of the beaker with a little 
of the filtered mother-liquor), press well with a large glass stopper and wash 
with 30 ml of saturated salt solution. To recrystallise the crude sodium 
toluene-p-sulphonate, dissolve it in 200-250 ml of water, heat to boiling, 
saturate with salt, allow to cool somewhat, stir with 2-3 g of decolourising 
charcoal (if the solution is coloured) and filter the hot solution with suction 
through a previously warmed Buchner funnel. Transfer the warm filtrate to a 
beaker and cool in ice: collect the sulphonate with suction on a Buchner 
funnel, wash it with 20 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution, press well 
and finally wash with a little alcohol. Dry the hydrated crystals in air upon 
filter papers, powder in a mortar and then dry in an oven or in an air oven at 
100-1 10 °C. The yield of anhydrous sodium toluene-p-sulphonate is 50g 
(40%). It still contains traces of sodium chloride and other salts; these can be 
removed by recrystallisation from rectified spirit (1 g of solid to about 40 ml 
of alcohol) or by extraction with boiling alcohol in a Soxhlet apparatus (Figs 
2.96 and 2.97). 

Note. (1) Toluene-p-sulphonic acid may be prepared by gently boiling a mixture of 
87 g (100 ml, 0.95 mol) of pure toluene and 37 g (20 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid 
(92% H 2 S0 4 by weight) in a 250-ml bolt-head flask fitted with a Dean and Stark tube 
(Fig. 2.31(a)), which should be filled such that a further 9 ml of water may be collected 
(4-5 hours). After this period of heating add 6.3 ml of water to the cold contents of the 
flask, and when crystallisation is complete, filter on a sintered-glass funnel. Dissolve 
the solid (47 g) in 22 ml of water, saturate with hydrogen chloride gas and allow the 
solution to stand for several hours. Filter the product of toluene-p-sulphonic acid and 
dry in a desiccator (KOH and CaCl 2 as absorbents). The yield is 35 g (22%), m.p. 105- 
106 °C (sealed tube). Note the i.r. absorption (KBr disc) at c. 3350 (OH), 3050 (C AR — 
H), 2900cm (C AL — H), multiple bands around 1250-1 160 and 1080-1000 cm" ' (S0 2 
asym. and sym. stretching respectively), and at c. 685cm" 1 (S — O stretching). The 
S0 2 stretching vibration is observed at lower frequencies in sulphonic acids compared 
to sulphonamides due, it is thought, to hydrogen bonding. 

Cognate preparation. Sodium p-bromobenzenesulphonate. Equip a 500-ml 
three-necked flask with a separatory funnel, an unsealed stirrer guide fitted 
with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer. Place 75 g (40 ml) of fuming 
sulphuric acid, d 1.88 (7-8% S0 3 ), in the flask and 40 g (27 ml, 0.25 mol) of 
bromobenzene (Expt 6.23) in the separatory funnel. Add the bromobenzene 
in small portions so that the temperature does not rise above 100 °C. If any 
bromobenzene remains unattacked, warm the mixture on a water bath until 
all of it has passed into solution. Allow to cool, and pour the reaction mixture 
in a thin stream with stirring into 140 ml of cold water. If a precipitate 
separates (dibromodiphenylsulphone, a by-product), filter the warm solution 
at the pump. Add 55 g of sodium chloride to the filtrate and heat (with 
stirring) until the salt dissolves. Cool the solution rapidly with stirring, filter 
the separated crude sulphonate at the pump and press the crystals as dry as 
possible. Upon drying in the air, the yield is 47 g. To purify the crude sodium 
p-bromobenzenesulphonate, powder the crystals in a mortar, transfer to a 
beaker, add 75 ml of a filtered, saturated solution of sodium chloride, stir, 
heat on a water bath for 30 minutes, allow to cool, filter and press the crystals 
as dry as possible; finally wash with a little alcohol. Dry in the air by 
spreading upon filter papers. The yield of purified sodium p-bromobenzene- 
sulphonate is 45 g (68%). The product, although pure enough for most 

875

practical purposes, contains traces of sodium chloride and other salts: these 
can be removed either by recrystallisation from hot rectified spirit (1 g of salt 
requires c. 25 ml of alcohol) or, more economically, by extraction with 
alcohol in a Soxhlet apparatus (Figs 2.96 and 2.97).

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a separatory funnel, a thermometer 
with its bulb about 2 cm from the bottom and a mechanical stirrer; the 
bearing for the stirrer consists of a glass tube lubricated with a little glycerine. 
Place lOOg (0.78 mol) of naphthalene in the flask and heat it either in an air 
bath or by means of a free flame. When the naphthalene melts, start the stirrer 
and adjust the heating so that the temperature is 160 + 5°C. Run in 166 g 
(90ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid from the funnel during 5-6 minutes: 
take care to maintain the temperature at 160 °C and remove the flame if 
necessary. Stir for 5 minutes and pour the solution into 750 ml of cold water. 
If the sulphonation has been properly conducted, there will be no precipitate 
of naphthalene but about 4g of insoluble di-2-naphthyl sulphone may 
separate. Boil with 3-4 g of decolourising carbon and filter with suction 
through a Buchner funnel. Partly neutralise the clear solution by carefully 
adding 40 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate in small portions. Heat the 
solution to the boiling point, saturate with sodium chloride (about 70 g are 
required) and then set aside to crystallise. Filter the crude sodium 
naphthalene-2-sulphonate at the pump and recrystallise from hot 10 per cent 
sodium chloride solution; dry by heating on a water bath or in an oven. The 
yield is 140 g (78%).

from the bath and mix the contents with a circular motion every two minutes. 
The reaction is complete when the xylene layer on the surface of the acid has 
disappeared. Cool to room temperature, add 5.0 ml of water cautiously with 
gentle swirling. Pour the warm reaction mixture into a 100-ml beaker and 
cool in ice. Filter off the crystalline solid with suction on a sintered glass 
funnel and press the crystals down with a glass stopper. Recrystallise the 
crude product from 5 ml of water and dry on filter paper. The yield of pure

7.20 (sharp m, 2H, C 3 , 4 — H), and 7.82 (broad s, 1H, C 6 — H). 

6.4.2 THE PREPARATION OF ARYLSULPHONYL CHLORIDES 

Arylsulphonic acids, either free or in the form of their sodium salts, are 
converted into the acid chloride by reaction with phosphorus pentachloride (or 
phosphorus oxychloride).

(chlorosulphonation) 

ArH + 2C1«S0 3 H 2 °~ 25 ° C &gt; Ar-SO,Cl + H 2 S0 4 + HC1 

The latter general procedure is illustrated by the chlorosulphonation of toluene 
which yields a mixture of toluene-o- and p-sulphonyl chlorides which may be 
separated by cooling to — 10 to — 20 °C when most of the para isomer, which is a 
solid, m.p. 69 °C, separates out (Expt 6.41).

In a 750-ml three-necked flask equipped as in Fig. 6.2 place 400 g (228 ml, 
3.44 mol) of chlorosulphonic acid (CAUTION: see Section 4.2.16, p. 424) and 
cool to 0°C in a freezing mixture of ice and salt. Introduce 100 g (115 ml, 
1.09 mol) of pure dry toluene from the dropping funnel dropwise at such a 
rate that the temperature of the well-stirred mixture does not rise above 5 °C. 
When all the toluene has been added (about 3 hours), stir the reaction 
mixture for 4 hours, and then allow to stand overnight in a refrigerator. Pour

the liquid on to 1 kg of crushed ice, separate the aqueous solution from the 
oily layer (mixture of toluene-o- and -p-sulphonyl chlorides) and wash the 
latter several times by decantation with cold water. To separate the ortho and 
para isomers, cool the oil at —10 to — 20 °C (e.g. with ice and calcium 
chloride) for several hours; the almost pure toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride will 
crystallise out. Filter at the pump upon a sintered glass funnel. The 
toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride (30 g, 14%) may be purified by recrystallisation 
from light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C) and then melts at 69 °C. The filtrate 
consists largely of toluene-o-sulphonyl chloride: it may be obtained pure by 
dissolving it in carbon tetrachloride, removing the solvent and fractionating 
under reduced pressure; it is an oil, b.p. 126°C/10mmHg. The yield is about 
120 g (58%). 

The i.r. spectra of these two isomers may be recorded as a KBr disc (para) 
and as a thin film (ortho); both spectra exhibit strong absorption at c. 1380 
and 1170cm" 1 arising from the stretching of the sulphur-oxygen double 
bonds. The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) of the para isomer confirms the 
aromatic substitution pattern, having signals at 3 2.49 (s, 3H, Me), 7.41 (d, 
2H, ortho-Ws to Me) and 7.90 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to S0 2 C1). The ortho isomer 
has 5 2.79 (s, 3H, Me), 7.21-7.73 (m, 3H, C 4 , 5 , 6 — H), and 8.0 (m, 1H, C 3 — H). 
The m.s. of the ortho isomer has principal fragment ions at m/z 192 (M, 37 C1), 
190 (M, 35 C1), 155 (M - 37 C1 or 35 C1), 91 (M - S0 2 C1, base peak), and 65 
(91 - C 2 H 2 ). 

Cognate preparation. 2,4,6-Triisopropylbenzenesulphonyl chloride. 19 To a 

mixture of triisopropyl benzene (100 ml) in chloroform (500 ml), magnetically 
stirred at 0°C, is added chlorosulphonic acid (120 ml) within 15 minutes 
under cooling and exclusion of moisture (CAUTION). The stirring is 
continued for 45 minutes at room temperature and the mixture poured on to 
crushed ice. The product is extracted with chloroform (500 ml) (CAUTION), 
dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and freed from solvent in vacuo at 
30 °C. The white residue is dissolved in warm pentane, and the solution is 
filtered and concentrated to about 200 ml. Triisopropylbenzenesulphonyl

chloride crystallises slowly on standing and is washed with pre-chilled 
( — 30 °C) pentane; after drying in vacuo over phosphorus pentoxide the yield 
is 75.1 g, m.p. 96-97 °C. Further concentration of the mother-liquor gives a 
second crop, 31.4 g, m.p. 94-96 °C. Total yield 106.5 g (86%). The product is 
recrystallised from pentane and dried over phosphorus pentoxide in vacuo. 

6.4.3 THE PREPARATION OF ARYLSULPHONAMIDES 

Arylsulphonyl chlorides may be readily converted into the corresponding 
arylsulphonamides (e.g. by treatment with solid ammonium carbonate or with 
concentrated ammonia solution) or into a substituted arylsulphonamide (by 
reaction with the appropriate amino compound). Arylsulphonylhydrazides (for 
use in the preparation of aliphatic nitriles, Section 5.13.2, p. 712) may be 
prepared by a similar reaction using anhydrous hydrazine. 20 

Ar-S0 2 Cl + NH 3 &gt; Ar-S0 2 NH 2 + HC1 

Ar-S0 2 Cl + RNH 2 &gt; Ar-S0 2 NHR + HC1 

Ar-S0 2 Cl + N 2 H 4 &gt; Ar-S0 2 NH-NH 2 + HC1 

These sulphonamides are highly crystalline, and in particular the derivatives 
from benzenesulphonyl chloride and toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride are used in 
the separation and identification of aromatic amines (Sections 9.6.21, p. 1273 and 
9.7.1, p. 1287). 

Toluene-o-sulphonamide is an intermediate in the synthesis of saccharin 
(Expt 6.42). Upon oxidising toluene-o-sulphonamide with potassium per- 
manganate in alkaline solution, the sodium salt of o-sulphonamidobenzoic acid 
is formed, which on acidification with concentrated hydrochloric acid passes 
spontaneously into the cyclic imide of o-sulphobenzoic acid or saccharin. 
Saccharin itself is sparingly soluble in cold water, but the imino hydrogen is 
acidic and the compound forms a water-soluble sodium salt. The latter is about 
500 times as sweet as cane sugar. 

When toluene-p-sulphonamide is dissolved in excess calcium hypochlorite 
solution and then acidified with acetic acid, the Af,AT-dichloro derivative [(6) 
dichloramine-T] separates rapidly. When this is heated with sodium hydroxide 
solution the sodium salt of the Af-monochloro derivative [(7) chloramine-T)] is 
formed and crystallises out on cooling at a suitable concentration (Expt 6.43).

Both chloramine-T and dichloramine-T slowly liberate hypochlorous acid in 
contact with water and are therefore employed as antiseptics; the former is 
employed in the form of a dilute (e.g. 0.2%) aqueous solution, and the latter 
(which is insoluble in water) as a solution in an organic solvent, such as a 
chloroalkane.

6.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The chlorosulphonation of acetanilide with excess chlorosulphonic acid 
affords mainly p-acetamidobenzenesulphonyl chloride (Expt 6.44). This is the 
essential intermediate in the synthesis of a range of sulphanilamide drugs. The 
simplest example, p-aminobenzenesulphonamide (sulphanilamide), is obtained 
by converting p-acetamidobenzenesulphonyl chloride into the amide with 
aqueous ammonia, and then selectively removing the protecting acetyl grouping 
with boiling aqueous hydrochloric acid. 2-(p-Aminobenzenesulphonamido)- 
pyridine (sulphapyridine, M and B 693, Expt 6.45) is prepared by reacting p- 
acetamidobenzenesulphonyl chloride with 2-aminopyridine and then removing 
the acetyl group as before. The synthesis of the required 2-aminopyridine is of 
interest in that it represents an example of a nucleophilic aromatic substitution 
by the amide ion at the 2-position in a pyridine ring system, under the influence 
of the powerful electron-withdrawing influence of the heteroatom.

Place 20 g (0.105mol) of toluene-o-sulphonyl chloride (Expt 6.41) in a large 
evaporating dish mounted on a water bath. Add powdered ammonium 
carbonate cautiously with stirring until the mass is quite hard and solid and 
the unpleasant odour of the sulphonyl chloride has disappeared. Allow to 
cool, and extract with cold water to remove the excess of ammonium 
carbonate. Recrystallise the crude toluene-o-sulphonamide first from hot 
water (add a little decolourising carbon if it is dark in colour) and then from 
ethanol. The yield of pure product, m.p. 154 °C, is 16g (89%). 

Record the i.r. spectrum and compare it with that of the para isomer 
shown on p. 317. The p.m.r. spectrum (DMSO-d 6 at 60 °C, TMS) shows

C4, 5,6 — H) and 7.91 (m, 1H, C 3 — H); this spectrum should be contrasted 
with that of the para isomer detailed below. The m.s. shows principal

fragment ions at m/z 171 (M), 155 (M - NH 2 ), 91 (M - S0 2 NH 2 or 155

Oxidation of toluene-o-sulphonamide to saccharin. In a 600- ml beaker, 
mounted on an electric hot plate and provided with a mechanical stirrer, 
place 12 g (0.07 mol) of toluene-o-sulphonamide, 200 ml of water and 3g of 
pure sodium hydroxide. Stir the mixture and warm to 34-40 °C until nearly 
all has passed into solution (about 30 minutes). Introduce 19 g (0.12 mol) of 
finely powdered potassium permanganate in small portions at intervals of 
10-15 minutes into the well-stirred liquid. At first the permanganate is 
rapidly reduced, but towards the end of the reaction complete reduction of 
the permanganate is not attained. The addition occupies 4 hours. Continue 
the stirring for a further 2-3 hours, and then allow the mixture to stand 
overnight. Filter off the precipitated manganese dioxide at the pump and 
decolourise the filtrate by the addition of a little sodium metabisulphite 
solution. Exactly neutralise the solution with dilute hydrochloric acid (use 
methyl orange or methyl red as external indicator). Filter off any o- 
sulphonamidobenzoic acid (and/or toluene-o-sulphonamide) which sepa- 
rates at this point. Treat the filtrate with concentrated hydrochloric acid until 
the precipitation of the saccharin is complete. Cool, filter at the pump and 
wash with a little cold water. Recrystallise from hot water. The yield of pure 
saccharin, m.p. 228 °C, is 7.5 g (58%). 

Conversion of saccharin into pseudosaccharin chloride. Mix intimately in a 
glass mortar 35 g (0.19 mol) of saccharin and 70 g (0.336 mol) of phosphorus 
pentachloride (CAUTION), transfer to a 250-ml round-bottomed flask 
connected by a ground glass joint to a reflux condenser; attach the latter 
through a calcium chloride guard-tube to a gas absorption trap. Heat the 
mixture in an oil bath at 175-1 80 °C for 90 minutes; at the end of this period 
the vigorous evolution of hydrogen chloride will have subsided. Replace the 
reflux condenser by a fractionating column, distil off the phosphorus 
oxychloride and pour the warm residue upon finely crushed ice. Extract the 
crude solid pseudosaccharin chloride with chloroform, dry the chloroform 
solution with anhydrous magnesium sulphate and distil off the solvent. 
Recrystallise the residue from chloroform or from dry benzene. The yield of 
pure pseudosaccharin chloride, m.p. 143-145 °C (decomp.), is 26 g (67.5%). It 
is best kept in a sealed glass tube or in a glass-stoppered bottle. 

Cognate preparation. 2,4,6-Triisopropylbenzenesulphonyl hydrazide. 20 A 

magnetically stirred solution of 2,4,6-triisopropylsulphonyl chloride (30.3 g, 
0.1 mol) (Expt 6.41), in tetrahydrofuran (60 ml), is cooled to — 10 °C in an 
ice-salt freezing mixture and anhydrous hydrazine hydrate (10.2 g, 0.22 mol, 
100%) (CAUTION) is added dropwise over a period of 15 minutes. The 
temperature rises to °C, and after stirring at °C for 3 hours, water (c. 2 ml) 
is added dropwise to dissolve the precipitated solids. The product is then 
transferred to a separatory funnel and the lower aqueous layer discarded. The 
organic layer is washed with ice-cold brine (3 x 20 ml), dried (anhydrous 
sodium sulphate) for 3 hours, filtered through hyflosupercel and then 
concentrated under reduced pressure below room temperature. Light 
petroleum (100 ml, b.p. 30-40 °C) is added to the crystalline mass so obtained. 
The material is collected by filtration, washed several times with light 



6.* PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



petroleum (b.p. 30-40 °C) and any remaining solvent removed by evapor- 
ation under reduced pressure at room temperature. The product is triturated 
with ice-cold water (3 x 100 ml), and finally dried in vacuo over phosphorus 
pentoxide at room temperature for 24 hours to give 2,4,6-triisopropylben- 
zenesulphonyl hydrazide (TBSH) as a colourless solid, m.p. 1 18—120 °C 
(decomp.); yield 28.9 g (96%) (1), R F 0.7 (chloroform-methanol, 9:1). 

Note. (1) TBSH should be stored in a dark bottle preferably at 4°C. Under these 
conditions decomposition occurs to only a small extent (5% in 9 months). The purity 
of TBSH may be assessed by t.l.c. analysis (CHCl 3 -MeOH, 9:1 v/v). Impure TBSH 
may be purified as follows: TBSH (60 g) is dissolved in ether (600ml) and the solution 
washed first with aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (3 x 50 ml, 0.75 m), and then 
with water (25 ml). Light petroleum (1 litre, b.p. 30-40 °C) is added to the dried 
(magnesium sulphate) organic layer. The precipitated TBSH (50 g) is collected by 
filtration and dried in vacuo over phosphorus pentoxide for 24 hours at room 
temperature.

Toluene-p-sulphonamide. Grind together 10 g (0.0525 mol) of toluene-p- 
sulphonyl chloride (Expt 6.41) and 20 g of ammonium carbonate in a mortar 
until a fine uniform powder is obtained. Heat the mixture in an evaporating 
dish on a water bath for 1-2 hours and stir the mixture frequently with a glass 
rod. Allow to cool and extract with a little cold water to remove the excess of 
ammonium salts. Recrystallise the crude toluene-p-sulphonamide from 
boiling water (200-250ml), and dry the colourless crystals at 100 °C. The 
yield of pure product, m.p. 138 °C, is 7.9 g (88%). 

The i.r. spectrum is given on p. 317. The para-substitution pattern is clearly 
shown by the p.m.r. spectrum (TFA, TMS) having signals at 3 2.46 (s, 3H, 
Me), c. 4.05 (broad low signal, 2H, NH 2 ), 7.37 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to Me), and 
7.84 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to S0 2 NH 2 ). The m.s. is similar to that of the ortho 
isomer noted above with some variation of relative abundance of individual 
fragment ions. 

Alternatively, grind 10 g of toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride to a fine powder 
and add it to 30 ml of concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.88). Heat the 
mixture to boiling (fume cupboard)) and cool. Filter and recrystallise the 
toluene-p-sulphonamide from boiling water (add 1 g of decolourising carbon, 
if necessary). The yield of pure product, m.p. 138 °C, is almost theoretical. 

Dichloramine-T(AT,Af-dichlorotoluene-p-sulphonamide). Prepare about 200 ml 
of a saturated solution of calcium hypochlorite by grinding a fresh sample 
of bleaching powder with water and filtering with slight suction. Dissolve 5 g 
(0.029 mol) of toluene-p-sulphonamide in as small a volume of the calcium 
hypochlorite solution as possible (about 150 ml) and filter the solution if 
necessary. Cool in ice, and add about 50 ml of a mixture of equal volumes of 
glacial acetic acid and water slowly and with stirring until precipitation is 
complete. The dichloramine-T separates out first as a fine emulsion, which 



882 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.4 



rapidly forms colourless crystals. Filter the latter at the pump, wash with a 
little cold water, drain and dry immediately either between pads of filter 
paper or upon a porous tile. The yield is 5.3 g (76%), m.p. 81 °C. Upon 
recrystallisation from light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) or from chloroform- 
light petroleum, pure dichloramine-T, m.p. 83 °C, is obtained with negligible 
loss. 

Chloramine-T (sodium Af-chlorotoluene-p-sulphonamide). For this prepara- 
tion use dichloramine-T which has been prepared as above and thoroughly 
drained but not necessarily dried. Heat 45 ml of 10 per cent aqueous sodium 
hydroxide solution in a beaker to a temperature of about 80 °C, add 3.5 g 
(0.015 mol) of dichloramine-T in small quantities, stirring the mixture gently 
after each addition until a clear solution is obtained. When the addition is 
complete, filter the hot solution if turbid, and then allow it to cool 
spontaneously. Filter the crystals with suction, wash with a little saturated 
sodium chloride solution and dry upon filter paper or in a desiccator over 
anhydrous calcium chloride. The resulting chloramine-T weighs 3g (75%) 
and is almost pure. It may be recrystallised, if desired, from twice its weight of 
hot water. 

Chloramine-T is a salt and has no definite m.p.: upon heating it loses water 
of crystallisation and decomposes violently at 175-1 80 °C.

/^Acetamidobenzenesulphonyl chloride. Equip a 500-ml two-necked flask 
with a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser: attach the top of the latter to a 
device for the absorption of hydrogen chloride (e.g. Fig. 2.61). Place 20 g 
(0. 148 mol) of dry acetanilide in the flask and 50 ml (90 g, 0.77 mol) of a good 
grade of chlorosulphonic acid (CAUTION: see Section 4.2.16, p. 424) in the 
dropping funnel and insert a calcium chloride guard-tube into the latter. Add 
the chlorosulphonic acid in small portions and shake the flask from time to 
time to ensure thorough mixing (1). When the addition has been made, heat 
the reaction mixture on a water bath for 1 hour in order to complete the 
reaction. Allow to cool and pour the oily mixture in a thin stream with 
stirring into 300 g of crushed ice (or ice-water) contained in a 1 -litre beaker. 
Carry out this operation carefully in the fume cupboard since the excess of 
chlorosulphonic acid reacts vigorously with the water. Rinse the flask with a 
little ice-water and add the rinsings to the contents of the beaker. Break up 
any lumps of solid material and stir the mixture for several minutes in order 
to obtain an even suspension of the granular white solid. Filter off the p- 
acetamidobenzenesulphonyl chloride at the pump and wash it with a little 
cold water; press and drain well. Use the crude product (2) immediately in the 
next stage. 

7&gt;-Acetamidobenzenesulphonamide. Transfer the crude p-acetamidobenz- 
enesulphonyl chloride to the rinsed reaction flask, and add a mixture of 70 ml 
of concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.88) and 70 ml of water. Mix the 

883 



6.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



contents of the flask thoroughly, and heat the mixture with occasional 
swirling (fume cupboard) to just below the boiling point for about 15 minutes. 
The sulphonyl chloride will be converted into a pasty suspension of the 
corresponding sulphonamide. Cool the suspension in ice, and then add dilute 
sulphuric acid until the mixture is just acid to Congo red paper. Collect the 
product on a Buchner funnel, wash with a little cold water and drain as 
completely as possible. It is desirable, but not essential, to dry the crude p- 
acetamidobenzenesulphonamide at 100 °C: the yield is about 18 g. The 
material is sufficiently pure (3) for the next stage. 

/9-Aminobenzenesulphonamide. Transfer the crude p-acetamidobenzene- 
sulphonamide to a 500-ml flask, add 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
and 30 ml of water. Boil the mixture gently under reflux for 30-45 minutes. 
The solution, when cooled to room temperature, should deposit no solid 
amide; if a solid separates, heat for a further short period. Treat the cooled 
solution with 2 g of decolourising carbon, heat the mixture to boiling and 
filter with suction through a hardened filter paper. Place the filtrate (a 
solution of sulphanilamide hydrochloride) in a litre beaker and cautiously 
add 16 g of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate in portions with stirring. After 
the evolution of gas has subsided, test the suspension with litmus paper and if 
it is still acid, add more sodium hydrogen carbonate until neutral. Cool in ice, 
filter off the sulphanilamide with suction and dry. The yield is 1 5 g (59% 
overall yield), m.p. 161-163 °C. A pure product, m.p. 163-164 °C, may be 
obtained by recrystallisation from water or from alcohol. 

Notes. (1) The reaction may be more easily controlled and the chlorosulphonic acid 
added all at once if the acetanilide is employed in the form of a hard cake. The latter is 
prepared by melting the acetanilide in the flask over a free flame and causing the 
compound to solidify over the lower part of the flask by swirling the liquid. If the 
reaction becomes too vigorous under these conditions, cool the flask momentarily by 
immersion in an ice bath. 

(2) The crude sulphonyl chloride, even if dry, cannot be kept without considerable 
decomposition. It may be purified by triturating with dried acetone, filtering any 
undissolved p-acetamidosulphonic acid and evaporating the filtrate. The pure 
chloride has m.p. 149 °C. 

(3) A small portion may be recrystallised from water, with the addition of a little 
decolourising carbon if necessary. The pure compound has m.p. 218 °C.

CAUTION: This preparation should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard 
and great care exercised in the handling of pyridine. 

2-Aminopyridine. In a 1-litre four-necked flange flask, equipped with a sealed 
mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer and inlet tube for nitrogen, 
place 300 ml of dry toluene (1) and 75 g (1.92 mol) of fine granular sodamide 
(2); bubble a steady stream of nitrogen through the toluene. Stir the mixture 
vigorously and heat the flask in an oil bath until the internal temperature is 
110°C (the bath temperature required is approximately 130°C). Add 100 g 
(1.26 mol) of pure dry pyridine (CAUTION: Section 4.1.29, p. 410) dropwise 
through the condenser fitted with a pressure-equalising funnel over a period 
of 4 hours: maintain the very efficient stirring and the stream of nitrogen. 
After 1 hour the reaction mixture becomes black in colour, and after 3 hours 
becomes viscous, and bubbling and slight frothing occurs, due to liberation of 
hydrogen. When all the pyridine has been introduced, continue the heating 
for a further 5 hours while maintaining the internal temperature at 1 10 °C. 
Towards the end of the reaction, stirring may become difficult owing to the 
separation of a solid or viscous cake. Allow the reaction mixture to cool 
(without the stream of nitrogen and without stirring); then introduce 175 ml 
of water very slowly through the condenser over a period of 2 hours while 
continuing the passage of the stream of nitrogen. During the addition the 
temperature rises to about 50 °C; resume the stirring as soon as possible. 
Transfer the contents of the flask to a separatory funnel, separate the lower 
aqueous solution and extract it with two 150 ml portions of toluene. Dry the 
combined main toluene layer and toluene extracts over anhydrous potassium 
carbonate for 2 hours; filter and remove the toluene by distillation. Distil the 
syrupy residue from an oil bath under diminished pressure through an air 
condenser: adjust the bath temperature to 120-130 °C. Collect the 2- 
aminopyridine at 95°C/10mmHg; this solidifies on cooling to a colourless 
solid, m.p. 55 °C (3). The yield is about 80 g (67%). 

Sulphapyridine. Dissolve 4.7 g (0.05 mol) of 2-aminopyridine in a mixture of 
40 ml of anhydrous acetone and 6 ml of dry pyridine (CAUTION) in a 250-ml 
flask, and add 11.7g (0.05 mol) of pure p-acetamidobenzenesulphonyl 
chloride (4). The reaction mixture is set aside overnight and 5.5 g of the 
almost pure 2-(p-acetamidobenzenesulphonamido)pyridine (^acetylsulpha- 
pyridine) is filtered off; by diluting the filtrate with water a further crop (4 g) 
is obtained. The total product is recrystallised from acetone to give white 
needles of pure product, m.p. 224 °C. The yield is 8g (55%). 

The acetylsulphapyridine (7.3 g) is hydrolysed by heating it under reflux 
with 75 ml of ethanol containing 15 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid for 
20min. The cooled solution is diluted with water and made just alkaline with 
concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.880). The sulphapyridine is isolated by 
filtration and recrystallised from ethanol; yield 4.9 g (75%), m.p. 190-191 °C. 

Notes. (1) Technically pure toluene can be conveniently dried by distilling 350 ml 
from a litre flask and rejecting the first 50 ml. 

(2) It is important to use recently prepared pure sodamide, which must be of fine 
granular form. Old material of irregular lumpy form, even if ground gives poor results, 
and should not be employed. The sodamide may be prepared as detailed in Section 
4.2.67, p. 462. A satisfactory grade is marketed by May and Baker Ltd. 



885 



6.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(3) The residue in the flask is said to contain 4-amino- and 2,6-diaminopyridine, 4,4'- 
bipyridyl and di(2-pyridyl) amine in varying amounts. 

(4) The p-acetamidobenzenesulphonyl chloride (Expt 6.44) must be pure: under no 
circumstances should it contain more than 1-2 per cent of the corresponding 
sulphonic acid. This may be ensured by lixiviating the sulphonyl chloride with pure 
anhydrous acetone and filtering the solution from the acid. 

6.4.4 THE PREPARATION OF ARYLSULPHONATE ESTERS 

These are prepared by the interaction of the arylsulphonyl chloride and an 
alcohol or phenol in the presence of sodium hydroxide solution or of pyridine 
(Expt 6.46). 

ROH + Ar-S0 2 Cl ^^&gt; ROS0 2 Ar + HC1 

These sulphonate esters cannot be made by direct esterification of the sulphonic 
acids since further reaction of the ester with the alcohol gives rise to an ether by 
means of an alkyl-oxygen fission process. 



-H®, + H® 



ROH "R-0-S0 2 Ar ' " &gt; R-O-R + HOS0 2 Ar 



For this reason the arylsulphonate esters find use as alkylating agents (cf. 
dimethyl sulphate and dialkyl sulphates, Section 4.2.24, p. 430).

p-Me-C 6 H 4 -S0 2 Cl + BuOH ~^t p-Me-C 6 H 4 -S0 2 -OBu 

Equip a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a separatory funnel, a mechanical 
stirrer and a thermometer, the bulb of which reaches within 2 cm from the 
bottom. Place 74g (89ml, 1 mol) of butan-1-ol and 105 g (0.55 mol) of 
toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride (Expt 6.41) in the flask and 160 ml of 20 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution in the separatory funnel; immerse the flask in a 
bath of cold water. Run in the sodium hydroxide solution, with stirring, at 
such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 15 °C (3-4 hours). Now 
add another portion of 105 g (0.55 mol) of toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride, and 
introduce 160 ml of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution slowly, keeping 
the temperature below 15 °C. Continue the stirring for 4 hours longer. 
Separate the oily layer and treat it with enough light petroleum (b.p. 60- 
80 °C) to cause it to float on water; then wash it well with 25 ml of 10 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution, and dry by allowing it to stand over 10 g of 
anhydrous potassium carbonate. Filter and distil off the solvent using a 
250-ml flask (rotary evaporator). Distil the residual ester under reduced pres- 
sure (1) (oil pump) and collect the butyl toluene-p-sulphonate at 
132-133 °C/3mmHg. The yield is 130g (57%). 

Record the i.r. spectrum (thin film) and note the strong absorptions at 
c. 1325 and 1165cm" 1 arising from the S0 2 -group. The p.m.r. spectrum 
(CC1 4 , TMS) shows signals at 5 0.88 (distorted t, 3H, — CH 2 -Me), 1.08-2.70

Note. (1) It is best to distil under greatly reduced pressure; slight decomposition 
occurs even at 10mm pressure (b.p. 170-171 °C/10mmHg). 

Cognate preparation. Dodecyl toluene-p-sulphonate ( pyridine method) (fume 
cupboard). In a 500-ml three-necked flask, equipped with a stirrer and 
thermometer, place 46.5 g (0.25 mol) of dodecan-1-ol (lauryl alcohol), m.p. 
22-23 °C, and 79 g (81 ml, 1 mol) of dry pyridine (CAUTION). Surround the 
flask by a bath sufficiently cold to lower the temperature of the mixture to 
10 °C. Add 52.5 g of toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride in portions during 20 
minutes, or at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 20 °C. Stir 
the mixture for 3 hours at a temperature below 20 °C, then dilute with 1 50 ml 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 500 ml of ice-water. Collect the ester on 
a chilled Buchner funnel and suck as dry as possible. Transfer the solid to a 
400-ml beaker, add 150 of methanol and warm the mixture on a steam bath 
until the ester melts. Cool in a freezing mixture while stirring vigorously; the 
ester separates in a finely divided state. Collect it on a chilled funnel and allow 
to dry in the air, preferably below 20 °C. The yield of ester, m.p. 24-25 °C, is 
78 g (92%). Recrystallise by dissolving in 100 ml of light petroleum, b.p. 40- 
60 °C, drying the solution over magnesium sulphate to remove traces of 
water, and cool to °C. Collect the pure dodecyl toluene-p-sulphonate, m.p. 
29-30 °C, in a chilled funnel (Section 2.20). 

The pyridine procedure may be applied to the preparation of other esters; 
they are isolated by ether extraction. The yields are generally better than by 
the sodium hydroxide method. 

Decyl toluene-p-sulphonate (pyridine-chloroform method). 21 Decan-1- 
ol (1.58 g, lOmmol) is dissolved in chloroform (10 ml) and cooled in an ice 
bath (0°C). Pyridine (1.62 ml, 20mmol; CAUTION) is then added, followed 
by the addition of toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride (2.85 g, 15mmol) in small 
portions with constant stirring. The reaction is completed in 2.5 hours (t.l.c. 
monitoring). Ether (30 ml) and water (7 ml) are added, and the organic layer 
is washed successively with hydrochloric acid (2 m), 5 per cent sodium 
hydrogen carbonate and water, and dried (magnesium sulphate). The solvent 
is removed under reduced pressure and the crude tosylate is chromato- 
graphed on silica gel (eluant, 2% ether-light petroleum) to yield the product as 
an oil, 3.06 g (98%); p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) 3 0.87 (t, 3H, Me), 1.22

6.4.5 REDUCTION PRODUCTS FROM ARYLSULPHONYL CHLORIDES 

Reduction of an arylsulphonyl chloride with zinc dust and water affords the zinc 
salt of the sulphinic acid, converted by sodium carbonate to the sodium salt, in 
which form it is conveniently isolated (e.g. sodium toluene-p-sulphinate, Expt 
6.47) and thence by hydrochloric acid into the somewhat unstable sulphinic 
acid.

Excessive drying of the free sulphinic acid must be avoided since it leads to 
partial conversion into the sulphonic acid and the thiolsulphonic ester.

An alternative synthesis of benzenesulphinic acid by way of the diazonium salt is 
given in Expt 6.75. 

More vigorous reduction of arylsulphonyl chlorides (or of sulphinic acids), 
for example with zinc and dilute sulphuric acid, gives rise to thiophenols, which 
are conveniently isolated by steam distillation. 

Ar-SO,Cl Zn HC1 &gt; ArSH 

The thiophenols have an extremely unpleasant and repulsive odour and their 
preparation in the undergraduate laboratory is not recommended. In those cases

add 40 g (0.61 mol) of zinc powder (90-100% pure). Stir the mixture and add 
50 g (0.26 mol) of finely powdered toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride in portions 
during about 10 minutes; the temperature rises to about 80 °C. Stir for a 
further 10 minutes and then heat the mixture further until the temperature is 
90 °C. Add 25 ml of 12 m sodium hydroxide solution, followed by finely 
powdered sodium carbonate in 5g portions until the mixture is strongly 
alkaline. Considerable frothing occurs. Filter at the pump and extract the 
residue by heating on a steam bath with 75 ml of water until excessive 
frothing occurs; continue stirring for a further 10 minutes. Filter with suction 
and add the filtrate to the main solution, concentrate to a volume of about 
100 ml with a rotary evaporator and cool in ice-water. Filter at the pump and 
dry the crystals upon filter or drying paper until efflorescence just com- 
mences, then place in a tightly stoppered bottle. The yield of sodium toluene- 
p-sulphinate dihydrate is 35 g (63%). 

The free sulphinic acid may be precipitated from a solution of the sodium 
salt in cold water by cautious acidification with hydrochloric acid. The 
toluene-p-sulphinic acid is filtered and sucked as dry as possible at the pump 
and dried rapidly between sheets of filter paper, m.p. 85 °C. 



6.5 AROMATIC AMINES 

Aromatic amines may be divided into three classes: 

(a) Primary amines: where the amino group is directly attached to the 
aromatic ring, e.g. aniline Ph*NH 2 . Amines with the amino group in the side 
chain, e.g. benzylamine Ph-CH 2 NH 2 , possess properties similar to those of 
simple aliphatic amines (Section 5.16). 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.5 



(b) Secondary amines: (i) purely aromatic amines, e.g. diphenylamine Ph 2 NH, 
and (ii) aromatic-aliphatic amines, e.g. Af-methylaniline, Ph*NH*Me. 

(c) Tertiary amines: (i) purely aromatic amines, e.g. triphenylamine Ph 3 N, 
and (ii) aromatic-aliphatic amines, e.g. Af,AT-dimethylaniline, Ph*NMe 2 - 

Primary aromatic amines are prepared by the following procedures. 

1. The reduction of nitro compounds (Expts 6.48 to 6.52). 

2. Molecular rearrangements of the Hofmann type (Expts 6.53 and 6.54). 

3. The replacement of a halogen by an amino group (see Expt 6.93). 

4. The replacement of a phenolic hydroxyl group by an amino group (Expt 6.55). 

Secondary and tertiary amines are prepared by: 

5. (a) Alkylation and (b) reductive alkylation procedures (Expts 6.56 to 6.58). 

Methods for the protection of the amino and imino groups are discussed in 
Section 6.5.6.

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The characteristic i.r. absorption of the stretching vibrations of the NH 2 and 
NH groups of primary and secondary amines are clearly visible in the 
3300 cm" 1 region (p. 290), as in the spectrum of Af-methylaniline (Fig. 3.27). The 
substitution pattern may often be assigned from inspection of the longer 
wavelength region (p. 280). The provisional assignment may be supported by 
consideration of the p.m.r. spectrum; descriptive illustrations are given in the 
preparative examples below. The frequently observed broad signals observed in 
the p.m.r. spectra of the nitrogen-bound protons, and also their ready exchange 
with, for example, deuterium oxide have been discussed on pp. 350 and 348. 
Some typical fragmentation patterns in the m.s. are descriptively analysed in the 
appropriate preparative sections. The u.v.-visible absorption of the aromatic 
system is slightly affected by the presence of an amino or imino group 
(bathochromic shift), but the additional presence of electron-withdrawing 
groups (e.g. N0 2 ) in the ortho or para positions can cause a marked shift into 
the longer wavelength (visible) region of the spectrum. 

6.5.1 THE REDUCTION OF NITRO COMPOUNDS 

Primary arylamines are generally prepared by the reduction of nitro com- 
pounds. When only small quantities are to be reduced and cost is a secondary 
consideration, tin and hydrochloric acid may be employed. 

Ar-N0 2 + 6[H] &gt; Ar-NH 2 + H 2 

Theoretically 1.5 mol of tin are needed for the reduction of the nitro group, the 
metal being oxidised to the tin(iv) state. 

2Ar-N0 2 + 3Sn + 12H® &gt; 2Ar-NH 2 + 3Sn 4 ® + 4H 2 

When reduction is complete, a complex amine chlorostannate may separate 
from which the amine is liberated by basification, using enough alkali to dissolve 
the tin hydroxides formed (e.g. the preparation of aniline, Expt 6.48). 

[Ar-NH 3 ]f [SnCl 6 ] 2e + 8 e OH &gt; Ar-NH 2 + Sn0 3 2e + 6Cl e 



890 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.5 



Alternatively decomposition of the complex is achieved by precipitation of the 
tin as its sulphide by passing hydrogen sulphide into the mixture at the end of 
the reaction (e.g. m-phenylenediamine, cognate preparation in Expt 6.48). 

Other metal-acid reducing systems may be used; reduction with iron and 
hydrochloric acid is employed on the technical scale for the manufacture of 
aniline. 

Ph-N0 2 + 2Fe + 6H® &gt; Ph-NH 2 + 2Fe 3 ® + 2H 2 

Ph-N0 2 + 3Fe + 6H® »• Ph-NH 2 + 3Fe 2 ® + 2H 2 

In practice, however, the amount of hydrochloric acid used is less than 5 per cent 
of the amounts indicated by either of the above equations. Various explanations 
have been advanced to account for this; one is that the following reaction is 
catalysed by acid or by hydroxonium ions. 

Ph-N0 2 + 2Fe + 4H 2 -^ Ph-NH 2 + 2Fe(OH), 

The use of iron and a little hydrochloric acid (or alternatively of iron and acetic 
acid) is to be preferred when the use of the more strongly acidic medium leads to 
the formation of undesirable by-products; nuclear chlorination, for example, 
often results when tin or zinc is used in association with concentrated 
hydrochloric acid. A suitable experimental procedure for the reduction of 2,4- 
dinitrotoluene to 2,4-diaminotoluene has been described. 23 

Compounds which are sensitive to acidic conditions may sometimes be 
successfully reduced to amines under alkaline conditions; in these cases iron(n) 
sulphate is often used as the reducing agent. Reduction with metal under 
alkaline (or alternatively essentially neutral) conditions leads to the formation of 
intermediate products of the reduction of the nitro group (see Section 6.8.1, p. 
953). Vigorous reduction under alkaline conditions using an excess of the 
reducing metal (e.g. zinc) may, however, lead to the complete reduction of the 
nitro group with the formation of the corresponding amine; this o-phen- 
ylenediamine (Expt 6.49) is conveniently obtained by reducing o-nitro- 
aniline in this way. 

Aromatic and heterocyclic nitro compounds are readily reduced in good 
yield to the corresponding amines (e.g. o-aminophenol, Expt 6.50) by sodium 
borohydride in aqueous methanol solution in the presence of a palladium-on- 
carbon catalyst. In this reduction there is no evidence for the formation of 
intermediates of the azoxybenzene or azobenzene type, although if the reaction 
is carried out in a polar aprotic solvent, such as dimethyl sulphoxide, azoxy 
compounds may sometimes be isolated as the initial products. 

Ammonium or alkali metal sulphides or polysulphides exhibit a useful 
selective reducing action in that they smoothly reduce one nitro group in a 
polynitro compound to yield the corresponding nitroamine (e.g. m-nitroaniline, 
Expt 6.51). 

The two methods described for the synthesis of ethyl p-aminobenzoate 
(Expt 6.52) from p-nitrobenzoic acid offer interesting comparison. Prior 
esterification of the carboxylic acid group (Method 2) yields a nitroester which 
cannot be reduced by a metal-acid reducing system owing to the possibility of 
hydrolytic cleavage of the ester grouping; conversion of the nitro into the amino 
group in this case is therefore by catalytic hydrogenation with Adams' platinum 
dioxide catalyst. In Method 1, metal-acid reduction of the nitro group yields the 

891 



6.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



amino acid, p-aminobenzoic acid, a reaction in which the final mixture requires 
careful basification to effect precipitation of the product, which is then esterified 
to give ethyl p-aminobenzoate. This compound (Benzocaine) is used as a local 
anaesthetic. 

Experiment 6.48 ANILINE 

Ph-N0 2 + 6[H] Sn/HC1 ) Ph-NH 2 + 2H 2 

Into a 500-ml round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, place 
25 g (21ml, 0.25 mol) of nitrobenzene and 45 g (0.38 mol) of granulated tin. 
Measure out 100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Pour about 15 ml of 
this acid down the condenser and shake the contents of the flask steadily. The 
mixture becomes warm and before long the reaction should be quite 
vigorous; if it boils very vigorously, moderate the reduction somewhat by 
temporarily immersing the flask in cold water. When the initial reaction 
slackens of its own accord, pour another 1 5 ml of hydrochloric acid down the 
condenser, shake the flask steadily to ensure thorough mixing and cool again 
if the reduction becomes too violent. Do not cool more than is necessary to 
keep the reaction under control; keep the mixture well shaken. Proceed in this 
way until all the 100 ml of acid has been added. Finally heat the mixture on a 
boiling water bath for 30-60 minutes, i.e. until the odour of nitrobenzene is no 
longer perceptible and a few drops of the reaction mixture when diluted with 
water yield a perfectly clear solution. During the course of the reduction, 
particularly during the cooling, aniline chlorostannate may separate as a 
white or yellow crystalline complex. 

Cool the reaction mixture to room temperature and add gradually a 
solution of 75 g of sodium hydroxide in 125 ml of water; if the mixture boils 
during the addition of the alkali, cool again. The hydroxide of tin which is 
first precipitated should all dissolve and the solution should be strongly 
alkaline: the aniline separates as an oil. Equip the flask for steam distillation 
as in Fig. 2.102, and pass steam into the warm mixture until, after the 
distillate has ceased to pass over as a turbid liquid, a further 120ml of clear 
liquid are collected. Since aniline is appreciably soluble (c. 3%) in water, it 
must be 'salted out' by saturating the distillate with salt. Use about 20 g of 
commercial salt for each 100 ml of liquid. Transfer the distillate, saturated 
with salt, to a separatory funnel, add about 40 ml of ether and shake to ensure 
intimate mixing of the solution and the ether; relieve the pressure within the 
funnel by momentarily lifting the stopper. (All flames in the vicinity must be 
extinguished during the extraction.) Allow the two layers to separate; run off 
the lower aqueous layer into a beaker, and pour the remaining ethereal layer 
through the mouth of the funnel into a 200-ml flask. Return the aqueous 
solution to the funnel and extract with a further 40 ml of ether. Proceed as 
before, and pour the ethereal extract into the flask. Dry the combined ethereal 
solutions with a few grams of anhydrous potassium carbonate (1): shake the 
well-stoppered flask for several minutes. 

Filter the ethereal solution through a fluted filter paper and remove the 
ether by flash distillation, using a 50-ml round-bottomed flask to which has 
been added a few boiling chips. Since ether is extremely volatile and also 
highly flammable, the flask must be heated by means of an electrically heated 



892 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.5 



water bath. When all the ethereal solution has been introduced into the flask, 
and no more ether distils on a boiling water bath, run out the water from the 
condenser, and distil the aniline either by direct heating over a wire gauze or, 
preferably, using an air bath (Fig. 2.46). A small quantity of ether may pass 
over during the early part of the distillation; it is therefore advisable to 
interpose a uralite board between the receiver and the flame. Collect the 
fraction b.p. 180-184 °C, in a weighed conical flask. The yield of aniline is 18 g 
(97%). 

Record the i.r. spectrum and note the absorptions at c. 3400cm l (NH 2 , 
sym. and asym. stretching vibrations), 1625 cm -1 (NH 2 bending vibration), 
1600, 1590, 1500, 1450 cm" 1 (ring breathing vibrations), and 750 and 
690 cm" 1 (monosubstitution). The p.m.r. spectrum (CC1 4 or CDC1 3 , TMS) 
shows a singlet (c. 3 3.32) for the NH 2 -group which disappears when the 
sample is shaken with deuterium oxide; the aromatic region of the spectrum 
reveals overlapping multiplets. The m.s. shows principal fragment ions at m/z 
93 (M, base peak), 92 (M - H), 66 (M - HCN), 65 (66 - H or 92 - HCN), 
and 39 (65 - C 2 H 2 ). 

Pure aniline has a b.p. of 184°C. When freshly distilled it is a colourless 
liquid, but becomes discoloured on standing, particularly when exposed to 
light, owing to atmospheric oxidation. The colour may usually be removed 
by distillation from a little zinc dust. 

Note. (1) Calcium chloride cannot be used to dry the ethereal solution because it 
combines with aniline (and other amines) to form molecular compounds. The best 
drying agent is sodium or potassium hydroxide (pellet form). 

Cognate preparation. m-Phenylenediamine. In a 2-litre round-bottomed 
flask, provided with a reflux condenser, place 25 g (0.15mol) of m- 
dinitrobenzene (Expt 6.18) and 100 g (0.84 mol) of granulated tin; add 200 ml 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 5 ml portions. When all the acid has 
been introduced, complete the reduction by heating on a water bath for 1 
hour. Dilute with 750 ml of water, heat nearly to boiling and pass hydrogen 
sulphide into the liquid until all the tin is precipitated as the sulphide. Filter a 
small quantity from time to time and test for completeness of precipitation 
with hydrogen sulphide. Allow the precipitate to settle overnight, decant the 
clear liquid and filter the residue through a large fluted filter paper (1). Add 
sodium hydroxide solution to the filtrate until the latter is strongly alkaline, 
and extract several times with ether. Dry over anhydrous potassium 
carbonate or sodium hydroxide pellets, remove the ether and then distil the 
residue: use an air condenser after all the ether has passed over. Collect the 
portion boiling between 280 and 284 °C: this solidifies on standing to 
crystalline m-phenylenediamine, m.p. 63 °C. The yield is 13 g (74%). 

Note. (1) The dihydrochloride may be obtained by evaporating the filtrate on a water 
bath until crystals appear, and then cooling in ice. The crystals are filtered at the 
pump, washed with a little concentrated hydrochloric acid and dried in a vacuum 
desiccator over sodium hydroxide.

6.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Equip a 750-ml three-necked flask with a reflux condenser and sealed 
mechanical stirrer, and place in it 46 g (0.33 mol) of o-nitroaniline, 27 ml of 20 
per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 170 ml of rectified spirit. Stir the 
mixture vigorously and heat it on a water bath to gentle boiling. Remove the 
source of heat from beneath the bath, and introduce 5 g portions of zinc 
powder at such a rate that the solution is kept boiling (1); add 90 g (1.4 mol) 
of zinc powder (2) in all. Reflux the mixture, with stirring, for 1 hour; the 
colour of the solution changes from deep red to nearly colourless. Filter the 
hot mixture at the pump; return the zinc residue to the flask and extract it 
with two 100 ml portions of hot rectified spirit. Combine the extracts with the 
filtrate, add 2g of sodium dithionite (Na 2 S 2 4 ) and concentrate the solution 
under reduced pressure (water pump) on a steam bath to a volume of 80- 
100 ml; use a rotary evaporator (Fig. 2.112). Cool the solution in a freezing 
mixture of ice and salt, collect the pale yellow crystals on a Buchner funnel, 
wash once with 10- 15 ml of ice-water and dry in a vacuum desiccator. The 
yield of crude o-phenylenediamine, m.p. 98-100 °C, is 33 g. This is sufficiently 
pure for most practical purposes. If a pure material is required (3), dissolve 
the crude product in 100-1 15 ml of hot water containing 1 g of sodium 
dithionite and add a few grams of decolourising carbon, filter and cool in an 
ice-salt mixture. Collect the colourless crystals of pure o-phenylenediamine 
on a Buchner funnel, wash with 10 ml of ice-water and dry in a vacuum 
desiccator; the yield is 28.5 g (79%), m.p. 100-101 °C. It darkens rapidly upon 
exposure to light. 

The i.r. spectrum (KBr disc) shows absorptions at c. 3400 cm" 1 (NH 2 
stretching), 1625cm" 1 (NH 2 bend), 1600, 1500, 1450cm" 1 (ring breathing) 
and 750 cm" l (four adjacent hydrogens). The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) 
shows signals at 3 3.28 [s, 4H, (NH 2 ) 2 ] and 6.67 (s, 4H, C AR — H); 
interestingly the chemical shift values of the aromatic hydrogens are all 
similarly affected by the presence of the amino groups, and this region is not 
structurally informative. The m.s. shows principal fragment ions at m/z 108 
(M, base peak), 107 (M - H), 81 (M - HCN), 80 (107 - HCN) and 54 (81 
- HCN). 

Notes. (1) Sometimes the reaction stops suddenly; it is then necessary to add a further 
10 ml of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and warm to the boiling point: this 
causes the reaction to continue. Occasionally, the reduction becomes very vigorous: a 
wet towel and a bath of ice-water should be kept close at hand. 

(2) This weight of zinc powder assumes 100 per cent purity: an equivalent amount of 
less pure material may be used (see Section 4.2.80, p. 467). 

(3) The crude o-phenylenediamine may be converted into the dihydrochloride and the 
salt purified in the following manner. Dissolve it in 60 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid and 40 ml of water containing 2 g of tin(u) chloride, and treat the hot solution 
with 2-3 g of decolourising carbon. Filter, add 100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid to the hot colourless filtrate and cool in a freezing mixture of ice and salt. Collect 
the colourless crystals of the dihydrochloride on a Buchner or sintered glass funnel, 
wash with a small volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid and dry in a vacuum 
desiccator over sodium hydroxide. The yield is 5 1 g.

CAUTION: This preparation should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard 
since hydrogen is evolved during the reaction. 

Place a suspension of 0.5 g of 10 per cent palladium-on-charcoal (cf. 
Section 4.2.54, p. 452) in 50 ml of water in a 500-ml conical flask and add 3.9 g 
(O.lOmol) of sodium borohydride in 75 ml of water (1); introduce a magnetic 
follower bar. Pass a slow stream of nitrogen through the stirred mixture and 
add a solution of 7.0 g (0.05 mol) of o-nitrophenol in 250 ml of 2 m sodium 
hydroxide, dropwise from a separatory funnel, during 5 minutes. Stir at room 
temperature until the yellow colour disappears (about 10 minutes) and then 
filter. Acidify the filtrate with 2 m hydrochloric acid to destroy excess 
borohydride and then neutralise the solution with dilute sodium hydroxide. 
Extract the product with four 50 ml portions of ether and evaporate the dried 
(MgS0 4 ) extract on the rotary evaporator. o-Aminophenol is obtained as an 
off-white solid, m.p. 167-169 °C; the yield is 4.3 g (75%). The product may be 
recrystallised from water to give the purified phenol, m.p. 169-171 °C. The 
infrared spectrum of o-aminophenol as a Nujol mull shows strong absorp- 
tions at 3380 and 3300 cm" 1 due to the antisymmetric and symmetric N — H 
stretching vibrations. The p.m.r. spectrum (TFA) is complex and shows 
signals corresponding to the aromatic protons as overlapping multiplets at 
3 7.53-6.92. This should be contrasted with the p.m.r. spectrum of the para 
isomer, p. 956. 

Note. (1) Addition of the reagents in this order prevents the possible ignition of 
hydrogen which can take place on addition of dry palladium-charcoal to solutions of 
sodium borohydride.

Dissolve 18 g (0.075 mol) of crystallised sodium sulphide, Na 2 S-9H 2 (1), in 
50 ml of water; add 6.0 g (0.0714 mol) of finely powdered sodium hydrogen 
carbonate in small portions with constant stirring. When the carbonate has 
dissolved completely, add 50 ml of methanol and cool below 20 °C. Filter off 
the precipitated sodium carbonate at the pump, using a small Buchner funnel; 
if necessary add 2-3 g of filter-aid to the reaction mixture before filtering, and 
prepare a bed of filter-aid in the Buchner funnel since this will aid the 
retention of the finely divided solid. Wash the precipitate with three 8 ml 
portions of methanol. Retain the filtrate and washings: these contain about 
3.9 g of NaSH in solution and must be used forthwith for the reduction. 

Dissolve 6.7g (0.04 mol) of m-dinitro benzene in 50 ml of hot methanol in a 
250-ml round-bottomed flask and add, with shaking, the previously prepared 
methanolic solution of sodium hydrogen sulphide. Attach a reflux condenser 
and boil the mixture for 20 minutes; ignore any further sodium carbonate 
which may precipitate. Allow the reaction mixture to cool and fit the 
condenser for distillation. Distil off most of the methanol (100-120 ml) from a 
water bath. Pour the liquid residue with stirring into about 200 ml of cold 
water. Collect the yellow crystals of m-nitroaniline by suction, wash with 
water and recrystallise from 75 per cent aqueous methanol. The yield of 
bright yellow crystals, m.p. 114°C, is 3.7 g (69%). 

Note in the i.r. spectrum the absorptions arising from the vibrational 

895 



6.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



modes of the N0 2 and NH 2 groups. The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 at 60 °C, 
TMS) shows a very complex pattern of overlapping multiplets at 3 6.8-7.7 
arising from the four dissimilar aromatic protons. The spectrum should be 
contrasted with those given by the ortho and para isomers (the latter is noted 
on p. 920). The m.s. of the three isomers show the same fragment ions but 
having different relative abundance: the ortho isomer has m/z 138 (M, RA 
&lt; 10%), 92 (M - N0 2 , RA 80%), 65 (92 - HCN, RA 100%): the meta isomer 
has ions at m/z 138 (RA 40%), 108 (RA 100%), 92 (RA 50%), and 65 (RA 
70%); the para isomer has ions at m/z 138 (RA 100%), 108 (RA 30%), 92 (RA 
42%), and 65 (RA 30%). 

Note. (1) Crystallised sodium sulphide is very deliquescent and only a sample which 
has been kept in a tightly stoppered bottle should be used. 

Cognate preparation. Reduction of 2,4-dinitrophenol. It is an interesting 
student exercise to carry out the reduction of 2,4-dinitrophenol under the 
conditions described above for m-dinitrobenzene. The spectroscopic features 
of the isolated and purified product, together with the melting point, in 
comparison with the literature values for the possible isomers, should enable 
a deduction to be made on the regioselectivity of the reaction.

occasional gentle warming may be necessary. After about 20 minutes, most of 
the tin will have reacted and a clear solution remains. Allow to cool 
somewhat and decant the liquid into a 1 -litre beaker; wash the residual tin by 
decantation with 1 5 ml of water, and add the washings to the contents of the

heat on a water bath with 200 ml of water to ensure extraction of the product 
and refilter. Concentrate the combined filtrate and washings until the volume 
has been reduced to 1 75-200 ml: filter off any solid which separates. Acidify 
the liquid to litmus with glacial acetic acid and evaporate on a water bath

aminobenzoic acid and heat the mixture under reflux for 2 hours. Upon 
cooling, the reaction mixture sets to a solid mass of the hydrochloride of ethyl 
p-aminobenzoate. It is better, however, to pour the hot solution into c. 300 ml 
of water (no hydrochloride separates) and add solid sodium carbonate 
carefully to the clear solution until it is neutral to litmus. Filter off the 
precipitated ester at the pump and dry in the air. The yield of ethyl 
p-aminobenzoate, m.p. 91 °C, is 10 g (69%). Recrystallisation from rectified 
(or methylated) spirit does not affect the m.p. 

Method 2. Ethyl /&gt;-nitrobenzoate. Place 21 g (0.125 mol) of p-nitrobenzoic 
acid (Expt 6.149), 11.5g (0.25 mol) of absolute ethanol, 3.8 g of concentrated 
sulphuric acid and 30 ml of sodium-dried benzene in a 250-ml round- 
bottomed flask, fit a reflux condenser and heat the mixture under reflux for 16 
hours. Add 50 ml of ether to the cold reaction mixture, wash the extract 
successively with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and water, dry with 
magnesium sulphate or calcium chloride and distil off the solvent on a water 
bath. Remove the last traces of benzene by heating in a bath at 100-1 10 °C. 
The residual ethyl p-nitrobenzoate (21 g, 86%) solidifies completely on 
cooling and melts at 56 °C. 

Ethyl /&gt;-aminobenzoate {catalytic reduction of ethyl p-nitrobenzoate). The 
general experimental details may be adapted from those described in Section 
2.17.1, p. 87. Place a solution of 9.75 g (0.05 mol) of ethyl p-nitrobenzoate in 
100 ml of rectified spirit together with 0.1 g of Adams' platinum dioxide 
catalyst in the hydrogenation flask, and shake in hydrogen in the usual 
manner. The theoretical volume of hydrogen (c. 3600 ml at 24 °C and 
760mmHg) is absorbed in 2.5 hours. Filter off the platinum with suction and 
rinse the reaction vessel with rectified spirit. Evaporate the alcohol from the 
combined filtrate and washings on a water bath; the residue solidifies on 
cooling and weighs 8.2 g. Dissolve the crude ethyl p-aminobenzoate in 
rectified spirit, add a little decolourising charcoal, boil and filter; heat the 
filtrate to the boiling point, add hot water to incipient crystallisation and 
allow to cool. The resulting pure benzocaine has m.p. 90 °C; the yield is 7 g 
(85%). 

The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) shows signals at 5 1.31 (t, 3H, Me),

and 7.81 (d, 2H, ortho-Ws to C0 2 Et). The m.s. reveals principal fragment 
ions at m/z 165 (M), 137 (M - C 2 H 4 ), 120 (M - OEt), 92 (M - C0 2 Et), and

6.5.2 MOLECULAR REARRANGEMENTS OF THE HOFMANN TYPE 

The general procedure of treating carboxylic acid amides with alkaline 
hypohalite solution is illustrated and discussed in the aliphatic series (Section 
5.16.6, p. 783) and is equally applicable to the synthesis of primary aromatic 
amines (e.g. anthranilic acid and 3-aminopyridine, Expt 6.53). It is of particular 

897 



6.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



use in those cases where it is required to introduce an amino group into a 
position on the aromatic ring which, because of the orienting effects of the 
substituents, cannot be effectively nitrated directly in order to use the direct 
nitration-reduction sequence. 

For the preparation of anthranilic acid the starting material is phthalimide, 
the cyclic imide ring of which is opened by alkaline hydrolysis in the first step of 
the reaction to give the sodium salt of phthalimidic acid (the half amide of 
phthalic acid). The intermediate undergoes the Hofmann reaction in the manner 
outlined on p. 783 yielding o-aminobenzoic acid (anthranilic acid). 

The conversion of a carboxylic acid into an amine by treatment with 
hydrazoic acid in concentrated sulphuric acid is known as the Schmidt reaction 
or rearrangement, which often gives higher yields than the related Hofmann 
rearrangement procedure

The use of the toxic and hazardous hydrazoic acid is avoided by generating it in 
situ by adding sodium azide gradually to the carboxylic acid in the presence of 
concentrated sulphuric acid and chloroform (eg.. 3,5-dinitroaniline, Expt 6.54). 
The reaction involves the hydrolysis of an intermediate isocyanate (RNCO), 
which is formed by a mechanistic pathway analogous to that involved in the 
Hofmann reaction.

It should be noted that amines may be formed by hydrolysis of amides arising 
from the intramolecular Beckmann rearrangement of ketoximes (p. 1047); this

species from a carbon to an electron-deficient nitrogen.

of water. Add 24 g (0.163 mol) of finely powdered phthalimide (Expt 6.155) in 
one portion to the cold sodium hypobromite solution in the form of a smooth

portion, heat the solution to 80 °C for about 2 minutes and filter if necessary. 
Cool in ice and add concentrated hydrochloric acid slowly and with stirring 
until the solution is just neutral (about 60 ml are required). (It is re- 
commended that a little of the alkaline solution be set aside in case too much 
acid is added.) Precipitate the anthranilic acid completely by the gradual 
addition of glacial acetic acid (20-25 ml are required): it is advisable to 
transfer the mixture to a 1 -litre beaker as some foaming occurs. Filter off the 
acid at the pump and wash with a little cold water. Recrystallise from hot 
water with the addition of a little decolourising carbon; collect the acid on a 
Buchner funnel and dry at 100 °C. The yield of pure anthranilic acid, m.p. 
145°C,is 14g(62%). 

Cognate preparation. 3-Aminopyridine. Prepare a cold sodium hypobromite

powdered nicotinamide (Expt 6.169) and stir vigorously for 15 minutes. 
Warm the solution in a water bath at 75 °C for 45 minutes. Isolate the crude

mixture after saturation with sodium chloride. Dry the extract over 
potassium hydroxide pellets and remove the ether. Crystallise the dark 
residue from a 4:1 mixture of benzene-light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) with 
the aid of decolourising charcoal. The yield of almost colourless product, m.p. 
63 °C, is 9.3 g (61%).

litre four-necked flange flask equipped with a reflux condenser, mechanical 
stirrer, a dropping funnel and thermometer (fume cupboard). Add 100 ml of 
chloroform and raise the temperature to 45 °C. Stir rapidly and add 17.5 g 
(0.27 mol) of sodium azide in small portions while maintaining the tempera- 
ture at 35-45 °C. The reaction is accompanied by foaming, which usually 
commences after about 3 g of sodium azide has been introduced. After all the 
sodium azide has been added raise the temperature so that the chloroform 
refluxes vigorously and maintain this temperature for 3 hours. Then cool the 
reaction mixture, pour it cautiously on to 500 g of crushed ice and dilute with 
3 litres of water. After 1 hour, separate the yellow solid by filtration at the 
pump, wash well with water and dry at 100 °C. The yield of 3,5-dinitroaniline, 
m.p. 162-163 °C, is 39 g (90%). The m.p. is unaffected by recrystallisation 
from dilute ethanol.

N0 2 -group makes the assignment of the substitution pattern unreliable. The

groups). 



6.5.3 THE REPLACEMENT OF A HALOGEN BY AN AMINO GROUP 

Unlike the ready replacement of a halogen in an alkyl halide with an amino 
group (Section 5.16.4, p. 779), the corresponding reaction with an aryl halide 
only proceeds under vigorous conditions, and generally the reaction is not 
preparatively useful. Thus aniline may be formed from chlorobenzene only by 
treatment with sodamide in liquid ammonia. A detailed study of the mechanism 
of the reaction led to the recognition for the first time of the reaction 
intermediate, benzyne. Other more convenient methods for the formation of 
benzyne have subsequently been developed, and the investigation of the 
trapping reactions of this intermediate has led to the introduction of a range of 
new synthetic reactions. An illustrative example is to be found in Expt 6.7. 

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (notably the nitro group) sited 
in the ortho or para positions of an aryl halide facilitates the halogen 
replacement. Here the mechanism proceeds by an addition-elimination se- 
quence and it is discussed and illustrated in the formation of 2,4-dinitroaniline 
and 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (Section 6.8.2, p. 959), and in the use of 1-fluoro- 
2,4-dinitrobenzene in the derivatisation of an amino group in an amino acid 
(Section 9.6.23, p. 1279). 



6.5.4 THE REPLACEMENT OF A PHENOLIC HYDROXYL GROUP BY AN AMINO GROUP 

The direct replacement of the hydroxyl group in simple phenols by an amino or 
substituted amino group requires drastic conditions and the method is not 
suitable for laboratory preparations. With the polyhydric phenols, and more 
particularly with the naphthols, such replacements occur more readily. Thus 2- 
naphthol is converted into 2-naphthylamine by heating with ammoniacal 
ammonium sulphite solution at 150°C in an autoclave. The reaction (the 
Bucherer reaction) depends upon the addition of the hydrogen sulphite ion to 
the keto form of the naphthol and the subsequent reaction with ammonia.

The reaction is reversible; thus 2-naphthylamine can be converted into 2-

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.5 



naphthol by heating with aqueous sodium hydrogen sulphite solution and then 
adding alkali and boiling until all the ammonia is expelled. 

2-Naphthylamine is no longer manufactured and its laboratory preparation 
should never be attempted because of its potent carcinogenic properties. For 
many preparative purposes (e.g. see 2-bromonaphthalene, cognate preparation 
in Expt 6.72, and 2-naphthoic acid, Expt 6.154), 2-naphthylamine-l-sulphonic 
acid may be used. This is obtained commercially by cautious treatment of 2- 
naphthol with sulphuric acid -the sulphonic acid group entering the 1 -position 
- followed by a Bucherer reaction. 

The Bucherer reaction is illustrated and its reversibility demonstrated in 
Expt 6.55, wherein the amino group of 2-amino-5-naphthol-7-sulphonic acid 
is replaced by the p-tolylamino group via the corresponding naphthol inter- 
mediate.

followed by a small volume of ice-cold water. Dry the residual 2-p-tolylamino-

6.5.5 ALKYLATION AND REDUCTIVE ALKYLATION PROCEDURES FOR THE PREPARATION 
OF SECONDARY AND TERTIARY AMINES 

Simple Af-alkyl- and Af,AT-dialkylanilines are readily prepared commercially by 
the alkylation of aniline with the appropriate alcohol. For example, N- 
methylaniline is prepared by heating a mixture of aniline hydrochloride (55 
parts) and methanol (16 parts) at 120 °C in an autoclave. For N,N- 
dimethylaniline, aniline and methanol are mixed in the proportion 80:78, 8 
parts of concentrated sulphuric acid are added and the mixture heated in an 

901 



6.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



autoclave at 230-235 °C at a pressure of 25-30 atmospheres. Af-Ethyl- and N,N- 
diethylaniline are prepared similarly. In the laboratory, alkylation of the amino 
group, to yield secondary and tertiary amines, is effected by reaction with the 
appropriate alkyl halide; Expt 6.56 includes the preparation of Af-benzylaniline 
and general procedures for the syntheiss of a range of Af-alkyl- and N,N- 
dialkylanilines. 

Af-Alkylanilines may be purified by converting them into the Af-nitroso 
derivative with nitrous acid followed by reduction of the separated nitroso 
compound with tin and hydrochloric acid, thus regenerating the Af-alkylaniline. 
For example: 

Ph-NH-Me Na ^ : &gt; Ph-N(NO)-Me Sn/HC1 &gt; Ph-NH-Me 

Af,AT-Dialkylanilines may be purified by refluxing with an excess of acetic 
anhydride: any unchanged aniline and Af-alkylaniline is converted into the 
relatively non- volatile acetyl derivative. 

Ph-NH 2 + (Me-CO) 2 &gt; Ph-NH-CO-Me + Me-C0 2 H 

Ph-NH-R + (Me-CO) 2 &gt; Ph-N(COMe)-R + Me-C0 2 H 

Upon fractionation the acetic acid and unreacted acetic anhydride pass over 
first, followed by the pure Af,AT-dialkylaniline. 

A convenient method for preparing in good yield a pure Af,AT-dialkylaniline 
or substituted aniline (Expt 6.57) directly from the corresponding amine consists 
on heating the latter with the appropriate trialkyl phosphate. 

3Ar-NH 2 + 2(RO) 3 PO »• 3Ar-NR 2 + 2H 3 P0 4 

Secondary amines can be prepared from the primary amine and carbonyl 
compounds by way of the reduction of the derived Schiff bases, with or without 
the isolation of these intermediates. This procedure represents one aspect of the 
general method of reductive alkylation discussed in Section 5.16.3, p. 776. With 
aromatic primary amines and aromatic aldehydes the Schiff bases are usually 
readily isolable in the crystalline state and can then be subsequently subjected to 
a suitable reduction procedure, often by hydrogenation over a Raney nickel 
catalyst at moderate temperatures and pressures. A convenient procedure, 
which is illustrated in Expt 6.58, uses sodium borohydride in methanol, a 
reagent which owing to its selective reducing properties (Section 5.4.1, p. 519) 
does not affect other reducible functional groups (particularly the nitro group) 
which may be present in the Schiff base; contrast the use of sodium borohydride 
in the presence of palladium-on-carbon, p. 894.

1.33 mol) of aniline in the flask, and 42 g (38 ml, 0.33 mol) of freshly distilled

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.5 



benzyl chloride (b.p. 177-179 °C) in the separatory funnel protected by a 
calcium chloride guard-tube. Heat the flask and contents to 90-95 °C, stir 
vigorously and run in the benzyl chloride slowly (about 1 hour). Continue the 
heating and stirring for a further 3 hours. Allow to cool. Filter with suction, 
separate the organic layer from the filtrate and wash it with 25 ml of saturated 
salt solution. Dry with magnesium sulphate and filter again with suction. 
Distil from a flask with fractionating side-arm (compare Fig. 2.108) under 
reduced pressure: aniline (about 80 g) distils at 81°C/12mmHg and the 
temperature rises rapidly. Collect the benzylaniline at 170-190 °C/12mmHg 
(most of it distils at 178-180°C/12mmHg); this solidifies on cooling, melts at 
34-36 °C, and is sufficiently pure for most purposes. The yield is 52 g (85%). If 
required perfectly pure, it may be recrystallised from about 35 ml of light 
petroleum, b.p. 60-80 °C; cool the solution in a freezing mixture to induce 
crystallisation, filter at the pump, wash with a little cold light petroleum, press 
and dry. The recrystallised Af-benzylaniline has m.p. 36 °C. 

Notes on the preparation of secondary alkylarylamines. The preparation of N- 
propyl-, N-isopropyl- and N-butylanilines can be conveniently carried out by 
heating the alkyl bromide with an excess (2.5-4 mol) of aniline for 6-12 hours. 
The tendency for the alkyl halide to yield the corresponding tertiary amine is 
thus repressed and the product consists almost entirely of the secondary 
amine and the excess of primary amine combined with the hydrogen bromide 
liberated in the reaction. The separation of the primary and secondary 
amines is easily accomplished by the addition of an excess of 50 per cent zinc 
chloride solution: aniline and its homologues form sparingly soluble additive 
compounds of the type B 2 ZnCl 2 whereas the alkylanilines do not react with 
zinc chloride in the presence of water. The excess of primary amine can 
be readily recovered by decomposing tthe chlorozincate with sodium hydrox- 
ide solution followed by steam distillation or solvent extraction. The yield of 
secondary amine is about 70 per cent of the theoretical. 

The experimental details for N-propylaniline are as follows. Reflux a 
mixture of 230 g (2.5 mol) of aniline and 123 g (1 mol) of propyl bromide for 
8-10 hours. Allow to cool, render the mixture alkaline and add a solution of 
150g (1.1 mol) of zinc chloride in 150g of water. Cool the mixture and stir: 
after 12 hours, filter at the pump and drain well. Extract the thick paste 
several times with boiling light petroleum, b.p. 60-80 °C (it is best to use a 
Soxhlet apparatus), wash the combined extracts successively with water and 
dilute ammonia solution, and then dry over anhydrous potassium carbonate 
or magnesium sulphate. Remove the solvent on a water bath, and distil the 
residue through a well-lagged fractionating column. Collect the N- 
propylaniline at 21 8-220 °C; the yield is 80 g (59%). Treat the pasty solid 
chlorozincate with an excess of sodium hydroxide solution and steam distil: 
1 30 g of pure aniline are recovered. 

Af-Isopropylaniline, b.p. 206-208 °C, and Af-butylaniline, b.p. 235-237 °C, 
may be similarly prepared. 

Notes on the preparation of tertiary alkylarylamines. Pure dialkylanilines may 
be prepared by refluxing the monoalkylaniline (1 mol) with an alkyl bromide 
(2 mol) for 20^30 hours; the solid product is treated with excess of sodium 
hydroxide solution, the organic layer separated, dried and distilled. The 
excess of alkyl bromide passes over first, followed by the dialkylaniline. N,N- 

903 



6.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



dipropylaniline, b.p. 242-243 °C, and N,N-dibutylaniline, b.p. 269-270 °C, are 
thus readily prepared. 

If the tertiary amines are suspected of being contaminated with primary 
and/or secondary amines, they may be purified by treatment with acetic 
anhydride: the following procedure is illustrative. Into a 250-ml round- 
bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, place 50 g (52.5 ml, 0.414 mol) 
of a good commercial sample of dimethylaniline and 25 g (23 ml, 0.245 mol) 
of acetic anhydride. Heat under reflux for 3 hours and allow to cool. Transfer 
to a 100-ml distillation flask and distil using an air bath. Some acetic acid and 
the excess acetic anhydride passes over first, followed by pure dimethylaniline 
(a colourless liquid) at 193-194 °C. There is a small dark residue in the flask. 
The yield depends upon the purity of the commercial sample but is not 
usually less than 40 g. 

Purification of TV-methylaniline. The laboratory preparation of AT-methyl- 
and AT-ethylanilines is hardly worth while since commercial grades of good 
quality (97-99% pure) are available. The following procedure, however, 
illustrates a useful and instructive method of purifying crude samples of 
secondary alkylarylamines via the derived AT-nitroso compound 
[CAUTION: (1)]. 

N-Nitroso-N-methylaniline (methylphenylnitrosamine). Place 53.5 g 

(0.5 mol) of commercial AT-methylaniline, 72.5 ml of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid and 200 g of crushed ice in a 500-ml beaker equipped with a 
mechanical stirrer. Support a separatory funnel with a long bent stem 
containing a solution of 36 g (0.52 mol) of sodium nitrite in 125 ml of water 
over the beaker. Stir the solution and run in the sodium nitrite solution 
during 10 minutes; do not allow the temperature to rise about 10 °C and add 
more ice if necessary. Continue the stirring for a further hour. Separate the 
oily layer, wash it once with 50 ml of water and dry it with anhydrous calcium 
sulphate. Distil under reduced pressure. Collect the AT-nitroso-AT- 
methylaniline (a pale yellow liquid) at 120°C/13mmHg. The yield is about 
65g(96%). 

Reduction ofN-nhroso-N-methylaniUne. Into a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask, 
fitted with a reflux condenser, place 39 g (0.29 mol) of AT-nitroso-AT- 
methylaniline and 75 g of granulated tin. Add 150 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid in portions of 25 ml (compare Expt 6.48); do not add the 
second portion until the vigorous action produced by the previous portion 
has subsided, etc. Heat the reaction mixture on a water bath for 45 minutes, 
and allow to cool. Add cautiously a solution of 135 g of sodium hydroxide in 
175ml of water, and steam distil (see Section 2.25); collect about 500ml of 
distillate. Saturate the distillate with salt, separate the organic layer, extract 
the aqueous layer with 50 ml of ether and combine the extract with the 
organic layer. Dry with anhydrous potassium carbonate, remove the ether on 
a water bath and distil the residual liquid collecting the pure methylaniline at 
193-194 °C as a colourless liquid. The yield is 23 g (74%). 

Note. (1) The potentially carcinogenic nature of AT-nitroso compounds is again 
emphasised (see Section 2.3.4, p. 49).

distil off the ether, treat the residue with an equal volume of acetic anhydride 
and allow to stand overnight. (The acetic anhydride treatment will remove 
any monoalkylaniline present.) Then add hydrochloric acid (20 ml of the

Note. (1) The Schiff base may be prepared by heating the components in the absence 
of solvent at 100 °C for 15 minutes, cooling, and then stirring the product with

6.5.6 SOME METHODS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE AMINO AND IMINO GROUPS 

The most commonly used protecting group for the aromatic amino and imino 
groups is the Af-acetyl group. Furthermore this protecting group restricts the 
activating influence of the amino group towards electrophilic ring substitution 
reactions. The general methods of formation are detailed in Section 9.6.21, p. 1273 
(see also Section 6.6.2, p. 916). Other methods of protection which are generally 
suitable are described under aliphatic amines (Section 5.16.7, p. 784). 



6.6 SUBSTITUTION PRODUCTS OF AROMATIC AMINES 

1. Nuclear substitution products (Expts 6.59 to 6.66). 

2. Acylated amines and their substitution reactions (Expts 6.67 and 6.68). 

The important spectroscopic features (i.r., p.m.r., m.s., and u.v.-visible) which 
are observed with the varied range of substitution products of aromatic amines 
are descriptively discussed under appropriate preparative sections. 

6.6.1 NUCLEAR SUBSTITUTION PRODUCTS 

The nuclear substitution reactions that are considered in this section are (a) 
halogenation, (b) nitrosation, (c) sulphonation and (d) ortho formylation. All 

906 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.6 



these reactions involve the introduction of the substituent into an arylamine, 
and the regioselectivity is governed by the ortho/para orientating effect of the 
amino (or alkylamino) group. As appropriate, experimental conditions are 
described which control the extent of substitution. The examples provide 
interesting comparison with the substitution reactions of acylated amines 
(Section 6.6.2, p. 916). 

HALOGENATION 

The free amino group strongly activates the aromatic ring towards electrophilic 
attack and aromatic substitution of amines often results in polysubstitution. For 
example, the bromination of aniline yields largely 2,4,6-tribromoaniline (Expt 
6.59). 

Monosubstitution of the free amine may be achieved by using a less reactive 
electrophile. Thus aniline and o-toluidine may be mono-iodinated (Expt 6.60) 
by treatment with iodine (in the presence of sodium hydrogen carbonate or 
calcium carbonate to remove the liberated hydrogen iodide), the substituent 
entering the position para to the amino group. Direct iodination can also be 
effected by using the more powerfully electrophilic reagent, iodine monochloride 
&lt;s+ i- 

(I-)-Cl); with p-aminobenzoic acid both of the positions ortho to the amino 
group are substituted to give 4-amino-3,5-diiodobenzoic acid (cognate prepar- 
ation in Expt 6.60). 

Several reactive chloro compounds have been used to attempt to effect the 
controlled monochlorination of aromatic amines. One such reagent is N- 
chlorosuccinimide, with which the chlorination of aniline, for example, can be 
largely restricted to monosubstitution, although a mixture of isomers {ortho- 
para, 1.9:1) is obtained. 24 One approach to the achievement of specific ortho 
chlorination is illustrated by the synthesis of o-chlorobenzanilide (Expt 6.61), 
readily hydrolysable to o-chloroaniline. The anilide is formed, by a type of S^i' 
mechanism indicated below, when Af-phenylhydroxylamine is benzoylated and 
the product is treated with thionyl chloride. 25 The reaction has been successfully 
applied to several substituted Af-phenylhydroxylamines, prepared by the 
controlled reduction of the corresponding substituted nitro compounds (cf. 
Expt 6.87).

NITROSATION e 

The nitrosonium ion (NO), generated in situ from sodium nitrite in the presence 
of hydrochloric acid at 0-5 °C, is also a weak electrophile and with tertiary 
amines, e.g. Af,AT-dimethylaniline, ring substitution occurs leading to the p- 
nitroso derivative (Expt 6.62).

C 6 H 5 -NR 2 NaNO:/HC1 &gt; ,-ON-C 6 H 4 -NR 2 

Secondary aromatic amines under these conditions form initially the Af-nitroso 
derivative (see notes on the purification of secondary amines in Expt 6.56), 
which when treated with hydrogen chloride in anhydrous ethanol-ether 
solution rearranges to the nuclear substituted nitrosoamine (eg.. p-nitroso-AT- 
methylaniline, cognate preparation in Expt 6.62). This rearrangement proceeds 
via the intermediate formation of the electrophilic nitrosyl chloride:

HCl „ 






C1-N=0 



SULPHONATION 

When conditions for the electrophilic substitution are strongly acidic, extensive 
protonation of the nitrogen lone electron pair occurs and its activating influence 
is considerably diminished. For example, if aniline is treated with an excess of 
concentrated sulphuric acid, and the resulting mixture (which contains aniline 
sulphate) is heated at 180°C until a test portion when mixed with sodium 
hydroxide solution no longer liberates aniline, p-aminobenzenesulphonic acid 
(sulphanilic acid) is formed; this separates as the dihydrate upon pouring the 
cooled mixture into water. The mechanism of this reaction is uncertain; a 
possible pathway is the rearrangement of the intermediate phenylsulphamic acid 
(1). The product is more appropriately represented by the zwitterionic structure 
(2) (Expt 6.63).

2-Aminobenzenesulphonic acid (orthanilic acid, Expt 6.64) is readily pre- 
pared by the reduction of 2-nitrobenzenesulphonic acid. The latter may be 
prepared by the hydrolysis of the corresponding sulphonyl chloride which is 
obtained from di-o-nitrophenyl disulphide. The preparation of this disulphide 
involves the use of the reactive aryl halide, 2-chloronitrobenzene (cf. Expts 6.93 

908 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.6 



and 6.100) in a disulphide-forming nucleophilic displacement using sodium 
disulphide. 

A straightforward route to the meta isomer (metanilic acid, Expt 6.65) is 
provided by the sulphonation of nitrobenzene followed by reduction of the nitro 
group. 

ORTHO FORMYLATION 

o-Aminobenzaldehyde and its ring-substituted analogues are important starting 
materials in the formation of various heterocyclic ring systems. The parent 
compound has been prepared by the reduction of o-nitrobenzaldehyde or by the 
oxidation of o-toluidine. Such procedures are obviously accompanied by 
undesirable side reactions resulting from the susceptibility of the carbonyl and 
amino groups respectively to the reaction conditions. The presence of other 
nuclear substituents could clearly provide further problems in chemoselectivity. 
A procedure involving the specific ortho formylation of a para-substituted 
amine, using 1,3-dithiane as the formyl equivalent, is worthy of note 26 (cf. ortho 
formylation of phenols, p. 993). The reaction sequence is formulated and 
illustrated by the conversion of p-toluidine into 2-acetamido-5- 
methylbenzaldehyde (Expt 6.66).

Dissolve 10 g (0.11 mol) of aniline in 40 g of glacial acetic acid and stir well 
with a mechanical stirrer while running in slowly a solution of 52.8 g (17 ml, 
0.33 mol) of bromine (CAUTION) in 34 ml of glacial acetic acid. The beaker 
should be cooled in ice during the addition as the reaction is exothermic. The 
final product (a pasty mass) should be coloured yellow by the addition of a 
little more bromine if necessary. Pour into excess of water, filter at the pump, 
wash well with water, press thoroughly and dry. The yield of tribromoaniline, 
m.p. 1 19-120 °C, is quantitative. Recrystallise a small portion from industrial 
(or rectified) spirit; m.p. 120 °C. 

The m.s. provides a good example of the fragmentation pattern of a 
compound having three bromine atoms; m/z 333 (M, RA 29%), 331 (M, RA 
99%), 329 (M, RA 100%), 327 (M, RA 32%), 170 and 168 (M— Br 2 , two each 
of RA 22.5%). The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) has 5 4.59 (broad s, 2H, 
NH 2 ), and 7.50 (s, 2H, C 3 , 5 — H). 

Conversion to 2,4,6-tribromoacetanilide. Dissolve 1 g of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline 
in 20 ml of acetic anhydride and add 2 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid. 
After 10 minutes, pour the reaction mixture into excess of warm water. Filter 
off the tribromoacetanilide, wash and dry; the m.p. is 231 °C. Recrystallise 
from alcohol; the m.p. is raised to 232 °C.

and introduce 85 g (0.33 mol) of powdered, resublimed iodine in portions of 
5-6 g at intervals of 2-3 minutes so that all the iodine is added during 30 
minutes. Continue stirring for 20-30 minutes, by which time the colour of the 
free iodine in the solution has practically disappeared and the reaction is 
complete. Filter the crude p-iodoaniline with suction on a Buchner funnel, 
drain as completely as possible and dry it in the air. Save the filtrate for the 
recovery of the iodine (1). Place the crude product in a 750-ml round- 
bottomed flask fitted with a reflux double surface condenser, add 325 ml of 
light petroleum, b.p. 60-80 °C, and heat in a water bath maintained at 75- 
80 °C. Shake the flask frequently and after about 15 minutes, slowly decant 
the clear hot solution into a beaker set in a freezing mixture of ice and salt, 
and stir constantly. The p-iodoaniline crystallises almost immediately in 
almost colourless needles; filter and dry the crystals in the air. Return the 
filtrate to the flask for use in a second extraction as before (2). The yield of p- 
iodoaniline, m.p. 62-63 °C, is 60 g (82%). 

Notes. (1) The iodine may be recovered from the aqueous filtrate, containing sodium 
iodide, in the following manner. Add 33 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and a 
solution of 65 g of sodium dichromate in 65 ml of water. Allow the iodine to settle, 
wash it three times by decantation, filter and allow to dry on a clock glass. The weight 
of crude iodine is about 50 g. 

(2) Two extractions usually suffice, but if much organic material remains, a third 
extraction should be made. If the p-iodoaniline from the second and third extractions 
is coloured, it should be refluxed for a short period in light petroleum solution with a 
little decolourising carbon and filtered through a hot water funnel (CAUTION: 
flammable). 

Cognate preparations. 2-Amino-5-iodotoluene. Triturate 20 g (0.14 mol) of

the mixture to a conical flask, and add 100 ml of distilled water with vigorous 
shaking of the flask. Allow the mixture to stand for 45 minutes with 
occasional agitation, then heat gradually to 60-70 °C for 5 minutes, and cool. 
Transfer the contents of the flask to a separatory funnel, extract the amine 
with three 80 ml portions of ether, dry the extract with anhydrous calcium 
chloride or magnesium sulphate and remove the excess of solvent. The crude 
2-amino-5-iodotoluene separates in dark crystals. Recrystallise from 50 per 
cent alcohol; nearly white crystals, m.p. 87 °C, are obtained, 26 g (80%). 

4-Amino-3 ,5-diiodobenzoic acid. In a 2-litre beaker, provided with a 
mechanical stirrer, dissolve 10 g (0.073 mol) of pure p-aminobenzoic acid, 
m.p. 192 °C (Expt 6.52), in 450 ml of warm (75 °C) 12.5 per cent hydrochloric 
acid. Add a solution of 48 g (0.295 mol) of iodine monochloride (Section 
4.2.44, p. 440) in 40 ml of 25 per cent hydrochloric acid and stir the mixture 
for one minute: during this time a yellow precipitate commences to appear. 
Dilute the reaction mixture with 1 litre of water whereupon a copious 
precipitate is deposited. Raise the temperature of the well-stirred mixture 
gradually and maintain it at 90 °C for 15 minutes. Allow to cool to room 
temperature, filter, wash thoroughly with water and dry in the air; the yield of 
crude acid is 24 g. Purify the product by dissolving it in dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution and precipitate with dilute hydrochloric acid: the yield of 
air-dried 4-amino-3,5-diiodobenzoic acid, m.p. &gt;350°C, is 23 g (81%).

Experiment 6.62 p-NITROSO-TVA-DIMETHYLANILINE 

C 6 H 5 -N(CH 3 ) 2 — % p-ON-C 6 H 4 -N(CH 3 ) 2 

Dissolve 30 g (31.5 ml, 0.25 mol) of JV,AT-dimethylaniline in 105 ml of concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid contained in a 600-ml beaker, and add finely crushed 
ice until the temperature falls below 5 °C. Stir the contents of the beaker 
mechanically (or, less satisfactorily, with a thermometer) and slowly add 
(c. 10 minutes) a solution of 18 g (0.26 mol) of sodium nitrite in 30 ml of water 
from a separatory funnel, the stem of which dips beneath the surface of the 
liquid. Maintain the temperature below 8 °C by the addition of ice, if 
necessary. When all the nitrite solution has been added, allow the mixture to 
stand for 1 hour, filter the yellow crystalline p-nitrosodimethylaniline 
hydrochloride at the pump, wash it with 40 ml of dilute hydrochloric acid 
(1:1), drain well and finally wash with a little alcohol. The yield is good and 
depends upon the purity of the original dimethylaniline. If the pure 
hydrochloride is required, it may be recrystallised from hot water in the 
presence of a little dilute hydrochloric acid; yellow needles, m.p. 177 °C. 
Recrystallisation is, however, unnecessary if the free base is to be prepared. 
Transfer 30 g of the hydrochloride to a 500-ml separatory funnel, add 
100 ml of water and shake until a thin paste of uniform consistency is 
obtained; add cold 10 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution with 
shaking until the whole mass has become bright green (the colour of the free 
base) and the mixture has an alkaline reaction. Extract the free base by 
shaking with two 60 ml portions of benzene (1). Dry the combined benzene 
extracts with a little anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filter into a 
distilling flask fitted with a water condenser. Distil off about half of the 
benzene. Upon cooling the residual solution, the p-nitrosodimethylaniline 
crystallises in deep green leaflets. Filter these off and dry them in the air. The 
yield of p-nitrosodimethylaniline, m.p. 85 °C, from the hydrochloride is 
almost quantitative.

Place 20.4 g (20 ml, 0.22 mol) of aniline in a 250-ml round-bottomed flask and 
cautiously add 74 g (40 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid in small portions; 
swirl the mixture gently during the addition and keep it cool by occasionally 
immersing the flask in cold water. Support the flask in an oil bath, and heat 
the mixture at 180-190 °C (fume cupboard) for about 5 hours (1). The 
sulphonation is complete when a test portion (2 drops) is completely 
dissolved by 3-4 ml of c. 2 m sodium hydroxide solution without leaving the 
solution cloudy. Allow the product to cool to about 50 °C and pour it 
carefully with stirring into 400 g of cold water or of crushed ice. Allow to 
stand for 10 minutes, and collect the precipitated sulphanilic acid on a 
Buchner funnel, wash it well with water and drain. Dissolve the crude 
sulphanilic acid in the minimum volume of boiling water (450-500 ml); if the 
resulting solution is coloured, add about 4 g of decolourising carbon and boil 
for 10-15 minutes. Filter through a hot-water funnel or through a preheated 
Buchner funnel. Upon cooling, the sulphanilic acid dihydrate separates in 
colourless crystals. When the filtrate is quite cold, filter the crystals with 
suction, wash with about 10 ml of cold water and press thoroughly with a 
wide glass stopper. Dry between sheets of filter paper or in a desiccator 
containing anhydrous calcium chloride; in the latter case, the water of 
crystallisation (and hence the crystalline form) is lost. The yield of sulphanilic 
acid is 20-22 g (52-58%). The substance does not melt sharply and no 
attempt should be made to determine the melting point; the crystals are 
efflorescent. 

Note. (1) If 40 ml of 10 per cent oleum is cautiously added to the aniline sulphate 
mixture, sulphonation proceeds much more rapidly and the time of heating is reduced 
from 5 hours to 1 hour.

Di-o-nitrophenyl disulphide. Place 120g (0.5 mol) of crystallised sodium 
sulphide (1) and 500 ml of rectified spirit in a 1-litre round-bottomed flask 
provided with a reflux condenser. Heat the flask on a water bath until the 
sulphide dissolves. Then add 16 g (0.5 mol) of finely powdered sulphur and 
continue the heating until all the sulphur dissolves forming a brownish-red 
solution of sodium disulphide (2). Prepare a solution of 105 g (0.66 mol) of o- 
chloronitrobenzene in 1 75 ml of rectified spirit in a 2-litre round-bottomed 
flask equipped with a reflux condenser; by means of a pressure-equalising 
dropping funnel, add the sodium disulphide solution down the condenser 
slowly and at such a rate that the reaction is under control. Heat the mixture 
on a water bath, gently at first until the violent reaction subsides, and then 
with the water boiling vigorously for 2 hours. Allow to cool. Filter with 
suction on a Buchner funnel. Transfer the mixture of organic disulphide and 
sodium chloride to a 400-ml beaker and stir thoroughly with 1 75 ml of water 
to remove the salt. Filter at the pump, drain well and wash the crystalline 
residue on the filter with 35 ml of alcohol to remove any unreacted o- 
chloronitrobenzene. The residual di-o-nitrophenyl disulphide melts at 193— 
195 °C and weighs 70 g (68%). 

Notes. (1) Crystallised sodium sulphide Na 2 S'9H 2 is very deliquescent, and only a 

sample which has been kept in a tightly stoppered bottle should be used; crystals as 

dry as possible should be selected. Alternatively, an equivalent amount of analysed 

fused sodium sulphide may be employed; this dissolves somewhat more slowly in 

alcohol. 

(2) If some sodium disulphide separates at the bottom of the flask, this should be 

dissolved in a little more rectified spirit and added to the chloronitrobenzene solution.

Buchner funnel, wash with 60 ml of water, drain well and dry in the air. The 
yield of moderately pure o-nitrobenzenesulphonyl chloride, m.p. 64-65 °C, is 
72 g (84%). The undried material may be used in the preparation of orthanilic 
acid. 

Orthanilic acid. Fit a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a sealed mechanical 
stirrer and a reflux condenser. Place 60 g of o-nitrobenzenesulphonyl 
chloride, 30 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate and 1 80 ml of water in the 
flask. Heat the mixture to boiling, with stirring; the hydrolysis of the 
sulphonyl chloride to the sulphonic acid is complete within 40 minutes after 
the compound has melted. Filter the orange-red solution and acidify (to 
litmus) with acetic acid (about 7.5 ml are required). Transfer the solution to 
the original flask (which has been thoroughly rinsed with water) equipped as 
before. Heat the solution to boiling, and add 105 g of finely divided iron 
filings (about 20 mesh) with vigorous stirring at the rate of about 7.5g every 
15 minutes. The mixture soon becomes deep brown and exhibits a tendency 
to froth. Complete the reaction by stirring for a further 4 hours, i.e. until a test 
portion when filtered yields an almost colourless filtrate; if the filtrate is 
orange or red, the heating and stirring must be continued. When the 
reduction is complete, add 2 g of decolourising carbon, filter the hot reaction 
mixture at the pump and wash the residue with three 1 5 ml portions of hot 
water: combine the washings with the main solution. Cool the filtrate to 
about 15 °C, and add 28.5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid slowly, and 
cool to 12-15 °C. Filter the acid with suction on a Buchner funnel, wash with 
a little cold water, followed by a little ethanol and dry upon filter paper in the 
air. The yield is 27 g (57%); the orthanilic acid has a purity of 97-99 per cent. 
If required perfectly pure it may be recrystallised from hot water; it 
decomposes at about 325 °C.

CAUTION: This preparation should be carried out in a fume cupboard. 

In a 500-ml bolt- head flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer, place 70 ml 
of oleum (20% S0 3 ) and heat it in an oil bath to 70 °C. By means of a 
dropping funnel, supported so that the stem is just above the surface of the 
acid, introduce 41 g (34 ml, 0.33 mol) of nitrobenzene slowly and at such a 
rate that the temperature of the well-stirred mixture does not rise above 100- 
105 °C. When all the nitrobenzene has been introduced, continue the heating 
at 1 10-1 15 °C for 30 minutes. Remove a test portion and add it to excess of 
water. If the odour of nitrobenzene is still apparent, add a further 10 ml of

fuming sulphuric acid, and heat at 110-115 °C for 15 minutes: the reaction 
mixture should then be free from nitrobenzene. Allow the mixture to cool and 
pour it carefully with vigorous stirring on to 200 g of finely crushed ice 
contained in a beaker. All the nitrobenzenesulphonic acid passes into 
solution; if a little sulphone is present, remove this by filtration. Stir the 
solution mechanically and add 70 g of sodium chloride in small portions: the 
sodium salt of m-nitrobenzenesulphonic acid separates as a pasty mass. 
Continue the stirring for about 30 minutes, allow to stand overnight, filter 
and press the cake well. The latter will retain sufficient acid to render 
unnecessary the addition of acid in the subsequent reduction with iron. 

Place 84 g (1.5 mol) of iron filings and 340 ml of water in a 1.5- or 2-litre 
bolt-head flask equipped with a mechancial stirrer. Heat the mixture to 
boiling, stir mechanically and add the sodium m-nitrobenzenesulphonate in 
small portions during 1 hour. After each addition the mixture foams 
extensively: a wet cloth should be applied to the neck of the flask if the 
mixture tends to froth over the sides. Replace from time to time the water 
which has evaporated so that the volume is approximately constant. When all 
the sodium salt has been introduced, boil the mixture for 20 minutes. Place a 
small drop of the suspension upon filter paper and observe the colour of the 
'spot': it should be a pale brown but not deep brown or deep yellow. If it is not 
appreciably coloured, add anhydrous sodium carbonate cautiously, stirring 
the mixture, until red litmus paper is turned blue and a test drop upon filter 
paper is not blackened by sodium sulphide solution. Filter at the pump and 
wash well with hot water. Concentrate the filtrate to about 200 ml, acidify 
with concentrated hydrochloric acid to Congo red and allow to cool. Filter 
off the metanilic acid and dry upon filter paper. A further small quantity may 
be obtained by concentrating the mother-liquor. The yield is 55 g (95%).

50 ml of absolute methanol at 25 °C is added while keeping the temperature 
below — 70 °C. The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at — 78 °C, then 
the cooling bath is removed, and the solution is warmed to room 
temperature. The solvent is removed in vacuo, 300 ml of dry toluene is added 
and the suspension heated under reflux for 12 hours. After cooling, the

steam bath for 5 minutes, allowed to cool and poured into 50 ml of water, 
whereupon the product precipitates. Sodium carbonate is added until the 
solution is basic. The product is collected by filtration, washed with water 
and dried under vacuum (320 mg, 90%). Further recrystallisation affords fine, 
white crystals, m.p. 159-160 °C. 

2-Acetamido-5-methylbenzaldehyde. Into a 5-ml round-bottomed flask 
equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a nitrogen atmosphere are placed 0.7- 
0.8 mmol of red mercury(n) oxide, 0.7-0.8 mmol of boron trifluoride-etherate 
(Section 4.2.8, p. 421), and 2 ml of 15 per cent aqueous tetrahydrofuran. To 
this stirred suspension under nitrogen is added 100 mg of the foregoing 
mercaptal dissolved in the minimum of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction 
mixture is stirred for 1 hour at 25 °C, poured into 10 ml of ether and 2 ml of 10 
per cent sodium carbonate solution is added. After mixing, the organic phase 
is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 5-ml portions of 
ether. The combined organic phases are washed with two 5-ml portions of 
water, and 5 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over 
anhydrous magnesium sulphate. The reaction mixture is then filtered and 
concentrated under reduced pressure to give 70 mg, m.p. 72-77 °C, of 2- 
acetamido-5-methylbenzaldehyde. Recrystallisation from cyclohexane-tetra- 
hydrofuran followed by sublimation gives 61 mg (92% yield) of product, m.p.

6.6.2 ACYLATED AMINES AND THEIR SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS 

Acylation of an aromatic primary or secondary amine may be readily achieved 
by using an acid chloride in the presence of base; however, acetylation is more 
usually effected with acetic anhydride rather than the more obnoxious acetyl 
chloride. 

In general, benzoylation of aromatic amines finds less application than 
acetylation in preparative work, but the process is often employed for the 

916 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.6 



identification and characterisation of aromatic amines (Section 9.6.21, p. 1273). 
In the Schotten-Baumann method of benzoylation, the amine, or its salt, is 
dissolved or suspended in a slight excess of 8-15 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution, a small excess (about 10-15% more than the theoretical quantity) of 
benzoyl chloride is then added and the mixture vigorously shaken in a stoppered 
vessel (or else the mixture is stirred mechanically). Benzoylation proceeds 
smoothly and the sparingly soluble benzoyl derivative separates as a solid. The 
use of the aqueous medium is possible because the sodium hydroxide only 
slowly hydrolyses the excess of benzoyl chloride to yield sodium benzoate and 
sodium chloride which remain in solution. 

Ar-NH 2 + Ph-COCl + NaOH y Ar-NH-CO-Ph + NaCl + H 2 

Ar 2 NH + Ph-COCl + NaOH &gt; Ar 2 N-CO-Ph + NaCl + H 2 

The benzoyl compounds frequently occlude traces of unchanged benzoyl 
chloride, which thus escapes hydrolysis by the alkali; it is therefore advisable, 
wherever possible, to recrystallise the benzoyl derivatives from methanol, 
ethanol or rectified spirit, since these solvents will esterify the unchanged acid 
chloride and so remove the latter from the recrystallised material. Sometimes the 
benzoyl compound does not crystallise well; this difficulty may be frequently 
overcome by the use of p-nitrobenzoyl chloride or 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride 
(Expt 6.161), which usually give highly crystalline derivatives of high melting 
point. Benzoyl compounds are readily hydrolysed by heating with about 70 per 
cent sulphuric acid (alkaline hydrolysis is very slow for anilides). 

Ar-NH-CO-Ph + H 2 S0 4 + H 2 &gt; Ar-NH 3 }HS0 4 e + Ph-C0 2 H 

Primary amines react readily upon warming with acetic anhydride to yield, in 
the first instance, the monoacetyl derivative. 

Ar-NH 2 + (Me-CO) 2 &gt; Ar-NH-CO-Me + Me-C0 2 H 

If heating is prolonged and excess of acetic anhydride is employed, variable 
amounts of the diacetyl derivative are formed. 

Ar-NH-CO-Me + (Me-CO) 2 &gt;■ Ar-N(CO-Me) 2 + Me-C0 2 H 

In general, however, the diacetyl derivatives are unstable in the presence of 
water, undergoing hydrolysis to the monoacetyl compound, so that when they 
(or a mixture of mono- and di-acetyl derivatives) are crystallised from an 
aqueous solvent, e.g. dilute ethanol, only the monoacetyl derivative is obtained. 
Highly substituted amines (e.g. Expt 6.59) react extremely slowly with acetic 
anhydride, but in the presence of a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid as 
catalyst, acetylation occurs rapidly. 

The disadvantages attending the use of acetic anhydride alone are absent 
when the acetylation is conducted in aqueous solution (see Section 9.6.21, p. 
1273). 

Conversion of the amino group into the acetamido group by acetylation 
modifies the interaction of the nitrogen lone pair with the n -electron system of 
the aromatic ring so that the ring is less powerfully activated towards 
electrophilic attack.

Protection of the amino group by acetylation, as in acetanilide, therefore usually 
permits monosubstitution reactions with appropriate electrophilic reagents to 
proceed smoothly. Thus with bromine, p-bromoacetanilide is the main product; 
the small quantity of the ortho isomer simultaneously formed can be easily 
eliminated by recrystallisation (Expt 6.67); hydrolysis of p-bromoacetanilide 
gives p-bromoaniline. Nitration leads similarly to p-nitroacetanilide which can 
be hydrolysed to p-nitroaniline (Expt 6.68).

Bromination of acetanilide. Dissolve 13.5 g (0.1 mol) of finely powdered 
acetanilide in 45 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 350-ml conical flask. In another 
small flask dissolve 17 g (5.3 ml, 0.106 mol) of bromine in 25 ml of glacial 
acetic acid, and transfer the solution to a burette or a separatory funnel 
supported over the flask. (For precautions attending the use of bromine, see 
Section 4.2.9, p. 422. The preparation should be conducted in a fume 
cupboard.) Add the bromine solution slowly and with constant shaking to 
ensure thorough mixing: stand the flask in cold water. When all the bromine 
has been added, the solution will have an orange colour due to the slight 
excess of bromine; a part of the reaction product may crystallise out. Allow 
the final reaction mixture to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes with 
occasional shaking. Pour the reaction product into 400 ml of water; rinse the 
flask with about 100 ml of water. Stir the mixture well and if it is appreciably 
coloured, add just sufficient sodium metabisulphite solution to remove the 
orange colour. Filter the crystalline precipitate with suction on a Buchner 
funnel, wash thoroughly with cold water and press as dry as possible with a 
wide glass stopper. Recrystallise from dilute methanol or ethanol (industrial 
spirit). The yield of p-bromoacetanilide, colourless crystals m.p. 167 °C, is 18 g 
(84%). 

The para-substitution pattern is confirmed by the p.m.r. spectrum 
(DMSO-d 6 , TMS) which shows signals at 5 2.10 (s, 3H, Me), 7.45 and 7.61 (d 
of d, 4H, the two pairs of aromatic protons), and 10.04 (broad s, 1H, NH). 
The m.s. has principal fragment ions at mjz 215 (M, 81 Br), 213 (M, 79 Br), 173 
(215 - CH 2 CO), 171 (213 - CH 2 CO), 92 (173 - 81 Br and 171 - 79 Br) and 
43 (CH 2 CO). 

Hydrolysis of p-bromoacetanilide. Dissolve 18 g (0.084 mol) of p- 
bromoacetanilide in 35 ml of boiling ethanol contained in a 500-ml round- 
bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser. With the aid of a pressure- 
equalising dropping funnel add 22 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
down the condenser in small portions to the boiling solution. Reflux for 30-

40 minutes or until a test portion remains clear when diluted with water. 
Dilute with 150 ml of water, and fit the flask with a condenser set for 
downward distillation. Distil the mixture from an air bath (Fig. 2.46) and 
collect about 100 ml of distillate; the latter consists of ethyl acetate, ethanol 
and water. Pour the residual solution of p-bromoaniline hydrochloride into 
100 ml of ice- water, and add, with vigorous stirring, 5 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution until just alkaline. The p-bromoaniline separates as an oil, 
which soon crystallises. Filter the crystals at the pump, wash with cold water 
and dry in the air upon pads of filter paper. The yield is 14 g (97%), m.p. 66 °C. 
Recrystallisation from dilute alcohol, which results in appreciable loss, is 
usually unnecessary. 

The assignment of signals in the p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) is made 
possible from the greater difference, compared to the amide above, in the 
chemical shifts of the aromatic protons thus: 3 3.53 (broad s, 2H, NH 2 ), 6.57

Nitration of acetanilide. Add 25 g (O.185mol) of finely powdered, dry 
acetanilide to 25 ml of glacial acetic acid contained in a 500-ml beaker; 
introduce into the well-stirred mixture 92 g (50 ml) of concentrated sulphuric 
acid. The mixture becomes warm and a clear solution results. Surround the 
beaker with a freezing mixture of ice and salt, and stir the solution 
mechanically. Support a separatory funnel, containing a cold mixture of 
15.5 g (11 ml) of concentrated nitric acid and 12.5 g (7 ml) of concentrated 
sulphuric acid, over the beaker. When the temperature of the solution falls to 
0-2 °C, run in the acid mixture gradually while the temperature is maintained 
below 10 °C. After all the mixed acid has been added, remove the beaker from 
the freezing mixture, and allow it to stand at room temperature for 1 hour. 
Pour the reaction mixture on to 250 g of crushed ice (or into 500 ml of cold 
water), whereby the crude nitroacetanilide is at once precipitated. Allow to 
stand for 15 minutes, filter with suction on a Buchner funnel, wash it 
thoroughly with cold water until free from acids (test the wash water) and 
drain well (1). Recrystallise the pale yellow product from ethanol or industrial 
spirit, filter at the pump, wash with a little cold alcohol and dry in the air 
upon filter paper (2). (The yellow o-nitroacetanilide remains in the filtrate.) 
The yield of p-nitroacetanilide, a colourless crystalline solid of m.p. 214 °C, is 
20 g (60%). 

Investigate by thin-layer chromatography the effectiveness of the recrys- 
tallisation process in the following way. Load a 20 x 5 cm thin-layer plate 
(Silica Gel G) with approximately 3 mm diameter spots of concentrated 
solutions (in acetone) of the crude and the recrystallised product. Concen- 
trate a portion of the ethanolic mother-liquor and similarly apply to the 
plate. Develop the chromatogram with a toluene-ethyl acetate mixture (4:1) 
and dry the plate. Mark the positions of the visible spots and leave the plate 
in a tank of iodine vapour to reveal the rest of the components. The 
recrystallised p-nitroacetanilide (R F 0.07) should be free from the pale yellow 
o-isomer (R F 0.36); these compounds are revealed by the iodine treatment.

6.7 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The mother-liquor contains two readily visible yellow components, which are 
p-nitroaniline (R F 0.24) and o-nitroaniline (R F 0.45), as well as both p- and o- 
nitroacetanilide. 

The para-substitution pattern is confirmed by the p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , 
TMS) which shows signals at 3 2.48 (s, 3H, Me), 7.82 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to 
NH 2 ), 8.35 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to N0 2 ), and 9.01 (s, 1H, NH). The m.s. shows 
principal fragment ions at m/z 180 (M), 138 (M — CH 2 CO, base peak), 92 
(138 - N0 2 ), and 65 (92 - HCN). 

Hydrolysis of p-nitroacetanilide. Boil a mixture of 15 g (0.083) of p- 
nitroacetanilide and 75 ml of 70 per cent w/w sulphuric acid (3) under a reflux 
condenser for 20-30 minutes or until a test sample remains clear upon 
dilution with 2-3 times its volume of water. The p-nitroaniline is now present 
in the liquid as the sulphate. Pour the clear hot solution into 500 ml of cold 
water and precipitate the p-nitroaniline by adding excess of 10 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution or of concentrated ammonia solution. When cold 
(cool the mixture in ice-water, if necessary), filter the yellow crystalline 
precipitate at the pump, wash it well with water and drain thoroughly. 
Recrystallise it from a mixture of equal volumes of rectified (or industrial) 
spirit and water or from hot water. Filter, wash and dry. The yield of p- 
nitroaniline, m.p. 148 °C, is 1 1 g (96%). 

The p.m.r spectrum (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) shows signals at 3 6.67 (broad s, 
2H, NH 2 ), 6.79 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to NH 2 ), and 8.09 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to 
N0 2 ). The m.s. of the three isomers are noted on p. 896. 

Notes. (1) Washing is accomplished most effectively by transferring the crude solid to 
a beaker, stirring well with wash water and refiltering. 

(2) The recrystallised material and the crude product should be examined by t.l.c. 
analysis. 

(3) The 70 per cent sulphuric acid is prepared by adding 60 ml of concentrated 
sulphuric acid cautiously and in a thin stream with stirring to 45 ml of water. 

6.7 FORMATION OF DIAZONIUffl SALTS AND THEIR USES 

Primary aromatic amines on reaction with nitrous acid in the presence of 
hydrochloric acid (or other mineral acid) at about 0°C yield diazonium salts as 
discrete intermediates. The diazonium salts similarly derived from aliphatic 
primary amines decompose readily even at this temperature to yield the 
corresponding alcohol (and other products) with the evolution of nitrogen. 

® e 

Ar-NH, + NaNO, + 2HC1 &gt; Ar-N=N}C1 + NaCl + H 2 

The acidified nitrite solution provides a source of the nitrosonium ion (1) which 
electrophilically replaces the hydrogen in the primary amino group to form the N- 
nitroso derivative (2). This has a tautomeric structure, the hydroxydiazo form 
(3) yielding the diazonium ion (4) under acidic conditions.

The experimental conditions necessary for the preparation of a solution of a 
diazonium salt, diazotisation of a primary amine, are as follows. The amine is 
dissolved in a suitable volume of water containing 2.5-3 equivalents of 
hydrochloric acid (or of sulphuric acid) by the application of heat if necessary, 
and the solution is cooled in ice when the amine hydrochloride (or sulphate) 
usually crystallises. The temperature is maintained at 0-5 °C and an aqueous 
solution of sodium nitrite is added portionwise until, after allowing 3-4 minutes 
for reaction, the solution gives an immediate positive test for excess of nitrous 
acid with an external indicator - moist potassium iodide — starch paper.* The 
precipitated amine hydrochloride (or sulphate), if any, dissolves during the 
diazotisation to give a clear solution of the highly soluble diazonium salt. The 
excess of acid (0.5-1 equivalents) maintains the proper condition of acidity 
required to stabilise the diazonium salt and hence to minimise secondary 
reactions, e.g. the interaction of some of the diazonium salt with unchanged 
amine to form a diazoamino compound, a reaction which occurs readily in 
neutral solution (see Expt 6.86). The reaction mixture must be kept very cold 
during the process (which is exothermic in character), otherwise the diazonium 
salt may be partially hydrolysed to the corresponding phenol (see below). 

Some amines, such as the nitroanilines, react rather slowly at low tempera- 
tures, but since the diazonium compounds formed are somewhat more stable the 
diazotisation may be conducted at room temperature, when the reaction 
proceeds more rapidly. If the amine salt is only sparingly soluble in water, it 
should be suspended in the acid in a fine state of division (this is generally 
attained by cooling a hot solution and stirring vigorously), and it passes into 
solution as the soluble diazonium salt is formed. 

A solution of sodium nitrite in concentrated sulphuric acid, which provides a 
nitrosonium hydrogen sulphate reagent, is a very effective diazotising medium 
which is particularly valuable for even more weakly basic amines, such as 2,4- 
dinitroaniline or the corresponding trinitro compound, picramide.

This reagent is used here for the diazotisation of 4-amino-3,5-diiodobenzoic acid

6.70). It is also used for the bis-diazotisation of m-phenylenediamine (the 

* In actual practice it is found that some time before the theoretical quantity of sodium nitrite has 
been added, the solution will give a blue coloration (presumably, in part, by atmospheric oxidation) 
within a few seconds of being placed upon the test paper. It must, however, be remembered that 
towards the end of the diazotisation the reaction with nitrous acid is somewhat slow, and it is 
imperative to wait a few minutes before making the test, and furthermore only an immediate blue 
coloration has any significance. It is advisable to dilute the drop of the test solution with a few drops 
of water on a watch glass before making the test. It is recommended that about 10 per cent excess 
of sodium nitrite of good quality (&gt;96% NaN0 2 : e.g. sodium nitrite recryst.) be employed; this will 
serve as an additional check. If a slight excess of sodium nitrite is accidentally added, it may be 
decomposed by the addition of a little urea or sulphamic acid; alternatively a small amount of the 
primary amine, dissolved in the acid used, may be added.

strongly acidic conditions. Unless the amino groups are extensively protonated 
in this way, partial diazotisation and self-coupling occurs (see below) with the 
formation of the azo dye Bismarck Brown.

To prepare the solid benzenediazonium chloride or sulphate, the reaction is 
conducted in the absence of water as far as possible. The source of nitrous acid is 
one of its organic esters (e.g. pentyl nitrite) and a solution of hydrogen chloride 
gas in absolute ethanol; upon the addition of ether only the diazonium salt is 
precipitated as a crystalline solid. 

Ph-NH, + Pn-ONO -^* Ph-N=N}C1 + PnCl + 2H 2 

Solid diazonium salts are very sensitive to shock when perfectly dry, and 
detonate violently upon gentle heating: they are, therefore, of little value for 
preparative work. Happily, most of the useful reactions of diazonium com- 
pounds can be carried out with the readily-accessible aqueous solutions, so that 
the solid (explosive) diazonium salts are rarely required. 

6.7.1 REACTIONS INVOLVING REPLACEMENT OF THE DIAZO GROUP 

Diazonium salts undergo a large number of reactions in which the diazo group 
is lost as molecular nitrogen and is replaced by a variety of other groups (e.g. 
OH, I, Br, CI, F, CN, N0 2 , S0 2 H, Ar and H) which become attached to the 
aromatic ring. This section describes the experimental conditions necessary to 
effect such conversions. 

When a solution of a diazonium salt is heated, nitrogen is evolved and the 
diazo group is replaced by a hydroxyl group in an Sjvl type of displacement 
reaction.

The diazonium sulphate is used in preference to the diazonium chloride, since 
the presence of chloride ions gives rise to small quantities of the aryl chloride as a 
by-product. The solution must be acidic in order to avoid the coupling reaction 
between unreacted diazonium salt and the phenol (see Section 6.7.2, p. 946). 
For the preparation of phenols and cresols, the aqueous solution of the di- 
azonium compound is warmed to about 50 °C; at higher temperatures the 
reaction may become unduly vigorous and lead to appreciable quantities of 
tarry compounds. For certain substituted amines, a higher temperature (e.g. 
boiling 40^60% sulphuric acid) is necessary to decompose the diazonium salt

AROMATIC COMPOUNOS 6.7 



completely (e.g. m-nitrophenol, Expt 6.69). These strongly acidic conditions at 
elevated temperatures are clearly unsuitable where there are present in the 
diazonium salt acid-sensitive groups. In such cases the decomposition of the 
diazonium salt has been found to proceed smoothly at °C in the presence of a 
copper(n) nitrate-copper(i) oxide reagent. 27 As an illustration of this method, 
the conversion of p-toluidine into p-cresol is given in the cognate preparation of 
Expt 6.69. The method has been applied successfully to those cases where the 
diazonium salt undergoes undesirable side reactions, rather than conversion to 
the phenolic product. An example is provided by the reactions of the 6-nitro-2- 
methylbenzenediazonium ion:

When an aqueous solution of an aryldiazonium salt is treated with an 
equivalent of potassium iodide and warmed on a water bath, the aryl iodide is 
formed in good yield (e.g. iodobenzene, Expt 6.70). 

Ar-N=N}C1 + KI * Arl + N 2 + KC1 

This simple procedure cannot be applied in the preparation of the correspond- 
ing chloro and bromo compounds. Sandmeyer (1884) found that the replace- 
ment of the diazonium group by halogen can be successfully accomplished in the 
presence of the appropriate copper(i) salt, thus providing an excellent method 
for the preparation of nuclear-substituted aromatic compounds from the 
corresponding amines. The reaction has been extended to groups other than 
halogens, for example the cyano ( — CN) and the thiocyanate ( — SCN) group. A 
general procedure for carrying out the Sandmeyer reaction is as follows. The 
amine is diazotised in the presence of hydrochloric acid with sodium nitrite at 
0-5 °C, and a solution of an equimolecular quantity of copper(i) chloride in 
hydrochloric acid is added: a deep brown, sparingly soluble complex of 
copper(i) chloride and the diazonium salt is formed, and when the temperature 
of the reaction mixture is raised, decomposition ensues accompanied by the 
evolution of nitrogen, the disappearance of the solid and the separation of an 
oily layer of the aryl chloride.

The aryl chloride is formed when the diazonium-copper(i) chloride complex

Details of the preparation of p-chloro toluene are given in Expt 6.71, which 
also includes o-chlorotoluene, chlorobenzene, m-chloronitrobenzene and o- 
chlorobenzoic acid as examples of cognate preparations. 

In the preparation of bromo compounds by the Sandmeyer reaction (e.g. p- 
bromotoluene and the cognate preparations in Expt 6.72), the amine is generally 
diazotised in sulphuric acid solution (or in hydrobromic acid solution), and the 
resulting aryldiazonium sulphate (or bromide) is treated with a solution of 
copper(i) bromide in an excess of hydrobromic acid; the addition complex is 
then decomposed by gentle heating and the bromo compound isolated by steam 
distillation. For the preparation of 2-bromonaphthalene the use of 2-naphthy- 
lamine (which is a potent carcinogen) as a starting material is avoided by using 
2-naphthylamine-l-sulphonic acid (see Section 6.5.4, p. 900). Diazotisation and 
reaction with copper(i) bromide yields 2-bromonaphthalene- 1-sulphonic acid; 
heating with aqueous sulphuric acid eliminates the sulphonic acid group (see 
also Expt 6.104) to give 2-bromonaphthalene.

One of the drawbacks of the Sandmeyer reaction is the number of competing 
side reactions leading to the formation of biaryls, azo compounds and phenols. 
A recent procedure to maximise the yield of aryl halide involves treatment of the 
arylamine with t-butyl nitrite and anhydrous copper(n) halide (the chloride or 
the bromide) in acetonitrile at 65 °C. 28 The method is illustrated by the 
preparation of p-chloronitrobenzene (Expt 6.73); the overall reaction may be 
represented as: 

2Ar-NH 2 + 2R-0-NO + CuX 2 »• 2ArX + 2ROH + CuO + H 2 + N 2 

Gattermann (1890) found that finely divided (i.e. freshly precipitated) copper 
or copper bronze acts catalytically in the decomposition of solutions of 
diazonium salts.

The yields in the Gattermann reaction, however (e.g. o-bromotoluene, Expt 6.74), 
are usually not as high as those obtained by the Sandmeyer method. Copper 
powder is also employed in the preparation of sulphinic acids (e.g. benzenesul- 
phinic acid, Expt 6.75) which are obtained when a solution of a diazonium 
sulphate is saturated with sulphur dioxide and decomposed by the addition of 
copper powder.

nitriles. The solution of the diazonium salt, which should preferably be carefully 
neutralised with sodium or calcium carbonate to avoid excessive evolution of 
hydrogen cyanide in the subsequent stage, is added to a solution of copper(i) 
cyanide in excess sodium or potassium cyanide solution (e.g. p-tolunitrile, Expt 
6.76); sometimes improved yields are obtained by substituting nickel cyanide for 
copper(i) cyanide. Hydrolysis of the aryl nitrile with sodium hydroxide solution, 
followed by acidification, yields the corresponding acid (see Section 6.13.2, p. 
1062). The Sandmeyer reaction thus affords an important indirect method of 
introducing the carboxylic acid group into an aromatic ring.

The controlled thermal decomposition of dry aryldiazonium fluoroborates to 
yield an aryl fluoride, boron trifluoride and nitrogen is known as the Balz- 
Schiemann reaction (Expt 6.77).

In general the required diazonium fluoroborate is obtained as a precipitate 
when a concentrated solution of sodium fluoroborate is added to a solution of a 
diazonium salt. In an alternative procedure (e.g. the preparation of p- 
fluoroanisole, cognate preparation in Expt 6.77), the amine is diazotised in 
solution in aqueous fluoroboric acid. The diazonium fluoroborates are less 
sensitive to shock and heat than most diazonium salts and may be prepared and 
handled in the dry state with relative safety. Most diazonium fluoroborates have 
definite decomposition temperatures and the rates of decomposition, with few 
exceptions, are easily controlled. Diazonium fluoroborates containing the nitro 
group, however, usually decompose suddenly and with violence on heating; in 
such cases the fluoroborate should be mixed with 3-4 times its weight of dry 
sand and heated cautiously until decomposition commences. 

The diazonium hexafluorophosphates, prepared similarly from the appropri- 
ate diazonium chloride solution and hexafluorophosphoric acid, may in general 
be used instead of the fluoroborates with advantage. The thermal decomposition 
of diazonium hexafluorophosphates to aryl fluorides generally proceeds 
smoothly and in better yield. 29 

A further interesting application of the diazo reaction is in the preparation of 
the otherwise difficultly accessible o- and p-dinitrobenzenes (Expt 6.78). The 
requisite nitroaniline is converted into the diazonium fluoroborate which is then 
decomposed in aqueous suspension in the presence of sodium nitrite with the aid 
of copper powder. 

It is frequently observed that in the replacement reactions discussed above 
significant amounts of biphenyl derivatives are present in the reaction product. 
Compounds of this type may be prepared deliberately by adding the aqueous 
diazonium salt solution to a liquid aromatic compound and then basifying the 
vigorously stirred two-phase system by adding sodium hydroxide (or sodium 
acetate) solution.

because it has a largely covalent structure passes substantially into the non- 
polar organic phase. In this phase it decomposes into free aryl radicals which 
displace hydrogen from the added aromatic reactant.

In the example (Expt 6.79) the reaction of the diazonium salt from o- 
chloroaniline with benzene to yield 2-chlorobiphenyl is illustrative. It should be 
noted, however, that when the liquid aromatic compound in which substitution 
is to occur is of the type ArZ, the directive influences which are used to explain 
electrophilic substitution processes are not operative. Thus irrespective of the 
nature of the substituent Z, ortho-para substitution predominates; this result 
supports the assumption that the substitution process is radical in type. 
Although the classical reaction occurs in a two-phase system, the use of the more 
stable diazonium fluoroborates together with the phase-transfer catalyst 18- 
crown-6 can sometimes be more convenient. The literature method for the 
preparation of 4-chlorobiphenyl in this way is given as a cognate preparation in 
Expt 6.19? 

The process of deamination involves the replacement of the diazonium group 
by hydrogen, thus effecting the overall removal of the primary amino group. In a 
simple procedure illustrated by the preparation of 1,3,5-tribromobenzene from 
2,4,6-tribromoaniline (Expt 6.80), the amine is converted into the diazonium 
sulphate in ethanol solution. Heating the solution brings about the reductive 
removal of the diazo group, the ethanol being oxidised to acetaldehyde. 

Ar-N=N}HSO? + EtOH &gt; ArH + Me-CHO + H 2 S0 4 + N, 

The value of the deamination process in synthesis is illustrated by a classical 
example - the synthesis of m-bromotoluene, described and formulated in Expt 
6.81. The key to the sequence is the bromination of p-acetotoluidide which 
occurs at the position ortho to the more strongly electron-releasing acetamido 
group. This is meta to the methyl group, a position which is virtually unattacked 
in the direct bromination of toluene. The acetamido group can then be readily 
removed by sequential hydrolysis, diazotisation and reduction. Other reducing 
agents may be used in place of ethanol, e.g. an alkaline sodium stannite solution 
is quite effective; this reagent is prepared by adding sodium hydroxide to an 
aqueous solution of tin(n) chloride until the initial precipitate just redissolves. 
An effective reagent is aqueous hypophosphorus acid, and an example of its 
use has been described in detail for the synthesis of 3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl from 
4,4'-diamino-3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl (o-tolidine). 30 As the latter compound is 
carcinogenic its preparation is ill-advised. More recently the deamination of 
diazonium salts with t-butyl nitrite in dimethylformamide has been shown to 
have wide applicability. 31 The reaction proceeds smoothly at 65 °C with the 
evolution of nitrogen gas, the volume of which may be measured and used to 
monitor the reaction. The mechanism of the reaction is thought to involve the 
following radical sequence in which the solvent (DMF = solH), is the hydrogen 
donor.

The general procedure is quoted in Expt 6.80 (cognate preparations) with

CAUTION: Diazonium compounds have been used for the preparation of:

treatment with potassium hydroxide, for example:

(c) Disulphides - by interaction with a solution of sodium disulphide. 

It cannot be too strongly emphasised that in all these reactions violently 
explosive diazo sulphides and related compounds may be formed, and another 
less hazardous method for the preparation of the desired compound should be 
used, if possible. The following reactions are known to lead to dangerous 
explosions: 

(i) diazotised o-nitroaniline, m-chloroaniline, 5-chloro-2-aminotoluene or 2- 

naphthylamine and sodium disulphide; 
(ii) diazotised m-nitroaniline and potassium O-ethyl dithiocarbonate; and 
(iii) diazotised aniline, p-bromoaniline, toluidines and naphthylamines and 

sodium hydrogen sulphide.

nitrobenzenediazonium sulphate may separate. Decant the supernatant 
liquid from the solid as far as possible. 

While the diazotisation is in progress, cautiously add 165 ml of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid to 150 ml of water in a 1-litre round-bottomed flask. 
Heat the mixture just to boiling. Add the supernatant liquid (diazonium 
solution) from a separatory funnel supported over the flask at such a rate that 
the mixture boils very vigorously (about 30 minutes). Then add the residual 
damp solid (or suspension) in small portions; avoid excessive frothing. When 
all the diazonium salt has been introduced, boil for a further 5 minutes and 
pour the mixture into a 1 -litre beaker set in ice-water, and stir vigorously to 
obtain a homogeneous crystal magma. When cold, filter at the pump, drain 
well and wash with four 20 ml portions of ice- water. Recrystallise by 
dissolving the crude product in hot dilute hydrochloric acid (1 : 1 by volume), 
decant from any residual dark oil, filter and cool to °C, when light yellow 
crystals separate (1). Spread these upon a large sheet of filter paper, and dry 
in the air in a warm room. The mother-liquor deposits a further crop (about 
2g) upon standing for 24 hours. The yield of m-nitrophenol, m.p. 96 °C, is 23 g 
(66%). Record the i.r. and p.m.r. spectra and compare them with those 
of the ortho and para isomers. 

Note. (1) When working with larger quantities of material, it is more convenient (and 
a better yield is obtained) to purify the air-dried product by distillation under 
diminished pressure using a short air condenser of wide bore and a few fragments of 
porous porcelain (or alternatively a pine wood splinter) to prevent bumping. Collect 
the pure m-nitrophenol at 160-165 °C/12mmHg; allow the flask to cool before 
admitting air otherwise the residue may decompose with explosive violence. The 
recovery is over 90 per cent of the pure wi-nitrophenol. 

Cognate preparation. p-Cresol. Use of copper ions in the decomposition. 27 p- 
Toluidine (5.34 g, 50mmol) is dissolved in 50ml of hot 35 per cent sulphuric 
acid and then allowed to cool to below 15 °C. Ice (50 g) is added and the 
amine bisulphate precipitated. A solution of 4.4 g (64 mmol) of sodium nitrite 
in 50 ml of ice-water is added dropwise under the surface of the ice-cooled 
solution with stirring at such a rate as to maintain the temperature at 0-5 °G 
After the solution has been stirred for an additional 5 minutes, a few crystals 
of urea are added to decompose any excess sodium nitrite. To the cold (0 °C) 
solution of the p-toluenediazonium bisulphate is added a solution of 187 g 
(775 mol) of copper(n) nitrate trihydrate in 1.75 litres of water. With vigorous 
stirring 6.63 g (45 mmol) of copper(i) oxide is added to the solution. The 
liquid becomes dark blue and rapidly changes to green. About 1 minute after 
the addition of the copper(i) oxide the nitrogen evolution ceases and a 
negative test with alkaline 2-naphthol indicates that the reaction is complete. 
The mixture is extracted with ether and the combined ethereal extracts are 
extracted with aqueous alkali. Acidification of the alkaline extract and re- 
extraction with ether, followed by drying of the ether extract and evaporation 
gives p-cresol in 88 per cent yield.

concentrated hydrochloric acid (1) and 55 ml of water contained in a 500-ml 
round-bottomed flask. Place a thermometer in the solution and immerse the 
flask in a bath of crushed ice (2); cool until the temperature of the stirred 
solution falls below 5 °C. Dissolve 16 g (0.23 mol) of sodium nitrite in 75 ml of 
water and chill the solution by immersion in the ice bath; add the sodium 
nitrite solution (3) in small volumes (2-3 ml at a time) to the cold aniline 
hydrochloride solution, and keep the latter well shaken. Heat is evolved by 
the reaction. The temperature should not be allowed to rise above 10 °C (add 
a few grams of ice to the reaction mixture if necessary) otherwise appreciable 
decomposition of the diazonium compound and of nitrous acid will occur. 
Add the last 5 per cent of the sodium nitrite solution more slowly (say, about 
1 ml at a time) and, after shaking for 3-4 minutes, test a drop of the solution 
diluted with 3-4 drops of water with potassium iodide-starch paper (4); if no 
immediate blue colour is obtained at the point of contact with the paper, add 
a further 1 ml of the nitrite solution, and test again after 3-4 minutes. 
Continue until a slight excess of nitrous acid is present. 

To the solution of benzenediazonium chloride add a solution of 36 g 
(0.2 16 mol) of potassium iodide in 40 ml of water slowly and with shaking. 
Nitrogen is evolved. Allow the mixture to stand for a few hours. Fit the flask 
with an air condenser and heat it cautiously in a boiling water bath until 
evolution of gas ceases. Allow to cool. Decant as much as possible of the 
upper aqueous layer and render the residual aqueous and organic layers 
alkaline by the cautious addition of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, 
i.e. until a drop of the well-shaken mixture withdrawn on a glass rod imparts 
a blue colour to red litmus paper. The alkali converts any phenol present into 
sodium phenoxide, which, unlike phenol itself, is not volatile in steam. Steam 
distil until no more oily drops pass over (Fig, 2.102). Transfer the distillate to 
a separatory funnel and run off the lower layer of iodobenzene into a small 
conical flask. The crude iodobenzene should have a pale yellow colour; if it is 
dark in colour, return it to the separatory funnel and shake it with a little 
sodium metabisulphite solution until a pale yellow colour is obtained, then 
remove the heavy layer as before. Dry with about 1 g of anhydrous calcium 
chloride or magnesium sulphate: filter through a fluted filter paper into a 
small distilling flask equipped with a short air condenser. Distil using an air 
bath (Fig. 2.46) and collect the fraction, b.p. 185-190 °C (5). The yield of 
iodobenzene (an almost colourless liquid) is 33 g (75%); the compound 
gradually develops a yellow colour upon exposure to light. 

Notes. (1) In computing the volume of acid required in the diazotisation process, it is 
helpful to remember that 100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, d 1.18, contain 
42.4 g of HC1, and 100 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid, d 1.84, contain 176gH 2 S0 4 . 

(2) For preparations on a larger scale, the lowering of temperature may be 
conveniently achieved by the addition of a quantity of crushed ice equal in weight to 
that of the hydrochloric acid and water. The mixture should be stirred mechanically. 

(3) It is advisable to add the sodium nitrite solution, particularly in preparations on a 
larger scale, with the aid of a dropping funnel with the tip of the stem extending well 
below the surface of the liquid: this will prevent loss of nitrous acid by surface 
decomposition into oxides of nitrogen. 

(4) It is advisable to test the potassium iodide-starch paper with acidified sodium 
nitrite solution: the commercial test paper is, particularly if it has been kept for a 
considerable period, sometimes almost useless. The solution must contain an excess of 
acid at all times, i.e. it must give a blue colour on Congo red paper.

(5) The iodobenzene is conveniently distilled under reduced pressure and the fraction, 
b.p. 77-80 °C/20mmHg or 63-64 °C/8 mmHg, collected. The product has a higher 
degree of purity than that obtained directly from benzene (Expt 6.24). 

Cognate preparations. p-Jodotoluene. Use 27 g (0.25 mol) of p-toluidine, 
63 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 63 ml of water: warm, if 
necessary, until all the amine dissolves. Cool the solution with vigorous 
stirring to 0-5 °C by immersion in a freezing mixture of ice and salt and the 
addition of a little crushed ice. Diazotise by the introduction, with stirring, of 
a solution of 1 8.5 g (0.27 mol) of sodium nitrite in 40 ml of water; maintain the 
temperature of the solution at 0-5 °C if possible, but do not allow it to rise 
above 10 °C. Add a solution of 44 g (0.265 mol) of potassium iodide in an 
equal weight of water gradually and with stirring. Allow to stand for 1 hour at 
the laboratory temperature and then heat cautiously on a water bath until 
evolution of nitrogen ceases. Allow to cool: a dark-coloured oil settles to the 
bottom and soon solidifies. Pour off as much of the aqueous layer as possible, 
add 1-2 g of sodium metabisulphite to remove the dark colour (gentle 
warming may be necessary) and then render the mixture alkaline with 10 per 
cent sodium hydroxide solution in order to retain any cresol which may be 
formed. Steam distil the mixture; if the p-iodotoluene solidifies in the 
condenser, turn off the condenser water for a few moments until the solid 
melts and runs down into the receiver. Filter off the solid in the receiver and 
recrystallise it from ethanol. The yield of p-iodotoluene (colourless plates), 
m.p. 35 °C, b.p. 21 1-212 °C, is 50 g (92%). 

p-lodonitrobenzene. Stir a mixture of 50 g (0.36 mol) of p-nitroaniline (Expt

hour. Cool the mixture to 0-5 °C, and diazotise with a solution of 25 g 
(0.36 mol) of sodium nitrite in 75 ml of water. Filter the cold solution, and add 
the filtrate with stirring to a solution of 100 g (0.6 mol) of potassium iodide in 
300 ml of water. Collect the precipitated solid by suction filtration and 
recrystallise it from ethanol. The yield of p-iodonitrobenzene, m.p. 171 °C, is 
73g(82%). 

p-Iodophenol. Dissolve 54.5 g (0.5 mol) of p-aminophenol (Expt 6.87) in a 
mixture of 60 g (32.5 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid, 250 ml of water and 
250 g of crushed ice in a large beaker or bolt-head flask. Cool the solution in a 
freezing mixture, stir mechanically and add during 1 hour a solution of 34.5 g 
(0.5 mol) of sodium nitrite in 75 ml of water. Stir for a further 20 minutes, and 
then add 18.5 g (10 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid. Pour the cold 
diazonium solution into an ice-cold solution of 100 g (0.6 mol) of potassium 
iodide in 100 ml of water contained in a beaker provided with a mechanical 
stirrer. After 5 minutes, add 1 g of copper bronze (which has been washed 
with ether), with continued stirring, and warm the solution slowly on a water 
bath. Maintain the temperature at 75-80 °C until the evolution of nitrogen 
ceases; the iodophenol separates as a dark heavy oil. Cool to room 
temperature, extract the reaction mixture with three 80 ml portions of 
dichloromethane, wash the combined extracts with dilute sodium meta- 
bisulphite solution or sodium thiosulphate solution and dry with magnesium 
sulphate. Remove the solvent on a water bath (rotary evaporator) and distil

sodium nitrite in 25 ml of water to an end-point with starch-iodide paper. 
Introduce into the clear solution, with stirring, a solution of 26 g (0.1 56 mol) 
potassium iodide in 50 ml of 1 m sulphuric acid, heat the mixture to boiling for 
10 minutes and then cool. Collect the o-iodobenzoic acid by suction filtration, 
and recrystallise from hot water. The yield is almost quantitative; m.p. 162 °C. 

3,4,5-Triiodobenzoic acid. Dissolve 6.8 g (0.0175 mol) of 4-amino-3,5- 
diiodobenzoic acid (Expt 6.60) in 30 ml of cold concentrated sulphuric acid, 
add a large excess (3.0 g, 0.0435 mol) of powdered sodium nitrite and allow 
the mixture to stand at °C for 2 hours. Treat the cold diazonium solution 
with a solution of 17.0g (0.1 2 mol) of potassium iodide in 40 ml of water; a 
dark red precipitate separates. Warm the mixture on a water bath until 
evolution of nitrogen ceases, and remove any residual iodine with a little 
sodium metabisulphite. Filter the yellow precipitate of crude 3,4,5-trii- 
odobenzoic acid, and recrystallise from dilute ethanol. The yield of pure acid, 
m.p. 289-290 °C, is 6.8 g (78%). 

1 ,3-Diiodobenzene. Add 45 g (0.65 mol) of sodium nitrite carefully and with 
stirring to 470 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid at 70 °C contained in a 2- 
litre beaker; ensure that the temperature does not exceed 75 °C during the 
addition. Cool the resulting solution in an ice bath with stirring and add 
dropwise a solution of 32.4 g (0.3 mol) of m-phenylenediamine (Expt 6.48) in 
215 ml of glacial acetic acid; do not allow the temperature to rise above 25 °C. 
When diazotisation is complete, replace the ice in the cooling bath by an ice- 
salt mixture, and when the temperature of the tetrazonium salt solution falls 
below 0°C (1), run in steadily 500 ml of distilled water with vigorous stirring, 
keeping the temperature of the solution below 10 °C. Then run the cold 
diluted solution with rapid stirring into a solution of 100 g (0.6 mol) of 
potassium iodide in 200 ml of water. The temperature of the reaction mixture 
rises to about 30 °C; allow it to remain with vigorous stirring for 45 minutes. 
Finally heat the mixture at 75 °C for 2 hours and leave it at room temperature 
overnight. Isolate the product by steam distillation; collect about 2 litres of 
distillate, make it just alkaline with 50 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide 
and extract with ether. Remove the ether from the washed, dried extract and 
crystallise the residual solid from a mixture of ethanol and ether with the aid 
of decolourising charcoal. A further crystallisation gives almost white crystals 
of pure 1,3-diiodobenzene, yield 60g (61%), m.p. 36-37 °C. 

Note. (1) Excessive cooling may cause the tetrazonium salt to crystallise out and 
make stirring difficult.

105 g (0.42 mol) of crystallised copper(n) sulphate as detailed in Section 
4.2.22, p. 428. Either wash the precipitate once by decantation or filter it at 
the pump and wash it with water containing a little sulphurous acid; dissolve 
it in 170 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Stopper the flask loosely (to 
prevent oxidation) and cool it in an ice-salt mixture whilst the diazotisation 
is being carried out. 

Dissolve 36 g (0.33 mol) of p-toluidine in 85 ml of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid and 85 ml of water contained in a 750-ml conical flask or beaker. 
Cool the mixture to °C in an ice-salt bath with vigorous stirring or shaking 
and the addition of a little crushed ice. The salt, p-toluidine hydrochloride, 
will separate as a finely divided crystalline precipitate. Add during 10-15 
minutes a solution of 24 g (0.35 mol) of sodium nitrite in 50 ml of water (1); 
shake or stir the solution well during the diazotisation, and keep the mixture 
at a temperature of 0-5 °C by the addition of a little crushed ice from time to 
time. The hydrochloride will dissolve as the very soluble diazonium salt is 
formed; when all the nitrite solution has been introduced, the solution should 
contain a trace of free nitrous acid. Test with potassium iodide-starch paper 
(see footnote, p. 921). 

Pour the cold diazonium chloride solution slowly and with shaking into 
the cold copper(i) chloride solution (2). The mixture becomes very thick, 
owing to the separation of an addition product between the diazonium salt 
and the copper(i) chloride (Me-C 6 H 4 -Nf Cl e -CuCl). Allow the mixture to 
warm up to room temperature without external heating, and shake 
occasionally (3). When the temperature reaches about 15 °C, the solid 
addition complex commences to break down with the liberation of nitrogen 
and the formation of an oily layer of p-chlorotoluene. Warm the mixture on a 
water bath to about 60 °C to complete the decomposition of the double salt; 
shake occasionally. When the evolution of nitrogen ceases, steam distil the 
mixture (compare Fig. 2.102) until no more oily drops are present in the 
distillate. Transfer the distillate to a separatory funnel, and remove the layer 
of p-chlorotoluene. Wash it successively with 30 ml of 10 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution (to remove any p-cresol which may be present), water, an 
equal volume of concentrated sulphuric acid (to remove a trace of azo 
compound that usually colours the crude product and cannot be removed by 
distillation) and water (to remove the acid). Dry with 3-4 g of anhydrous 
calcium chloride or magnesium sulphate, decant or filter through a small 
fluted filter paper and distil from an air bath (Fig. 2.46) using an air 
condenser. Collect the p-chlorotoluene at 158-162 °C (a colourless liquid; 
m.p. 6-7 °C); the yield is 33 g (78%). 

The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) shows signals at 3 2.29 (s, 3H, Me), 
and a four-proton multiplet, that has the appearance of an AB spectrum, in 
which the difference in the chemical shift (Av) approaches the value of the 
coupling constant (see Fig. 3.58); the values for these pairs of protons have 
been calculated as 6.98 and 7.12. The p.m.r. spectrum of the ortho isomer 
(cognate preparation below) shows signals at 5 2.37 (s, 3H, Me; note the more 
significant deshielding influence of the ortho chlorine in this case), and 6.9-7.4 
(m, 4H, C AR — H). The m.s. of the two isomers are similar with variations in 
RA of particular fragment ions: for the para isomer the values of m/z are 128 
(M, 37 C1), 126 (M, 35 C1), 127 and 125 (M - H), 91 (M - 37 C1 or 35 C1, base 
peak).

Notes. (1) The sodium nitrite solution is conveniently added from a dropping funnel; 
it is recommended, particularly for preparations on a larger scale, that the tip of the 
stem of the funnel dip well below the surface of the liquid. 

(2) The diazonium salt solution decomposes on standing and hence must be mixed 
with the copper(i) chloride solution without delay. Mechanical stirring is an 
advantage. 

(3) For preparations on a larger scale, mechanical stirring is essential and should be 
continued for 2-3 hours after the solution has attained room temperature. 

Cognate preparations. o-Chlorotoluene. Proceed as for p-chlorotoluene, but 
use 36 g of o-toluidine. Collect the o-chlorotoluene at 155-158 °C; the yield is 
33 g. 

m-Chloronitrobenzene. This preparation is very similar to that of p- 
chlorotoluene, but certain modifications must be introduced. The quantities 
required are: 46 g (0.35 mol) of m-nitroaniline (Expt 6.51), 85 ml of concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid, 85 ml of water, a solution of 24 g (0.35 mol) of 
sodium nitrite in 50 ml of water (if the resulting diazonium salt solution is not 
clear, it must be filtered), and copper(i) chloride from 105 g (0.42 mol) of 
crystallised copper(n) sulphate (Section 4.2.22, p. 428), dissolved in 1 70 ml of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid. Run the diazonium salt solution into the 
solution of copper(i) chloride while the temperature is kept at 25-30 °C 
(water bath); at lower temperatures the decomposition of the unstable 
addition compound proceeds too slowly and would cause too violent an 
evolution of nitrogen upon warming, and at a higher temperature the 
formation of tarry by-products increases. Warm the mixture under a reflux 
condenser on a water bath until the evolution of nitrogen ceases. Steam distil 
(1); if the m-chloronitrobenzene solidifies in the condenser, turn off the 
condenser water for a few moments until the solid melts and runs down into 
the receiver. Allow the steam distillate to cool, decant the water and shake the 
solid with 200 ml of 1 per cent sodium hydroxide solution at 50 °C (to remove 
m-nitrophenol, if present). Allow the mixture to cool, filter with suction, 
wash with a little cold water and dry in the air. Determine the m.p. If this is 
not satisfactory, i.e. if it is appreciably below 44-^45 °C, purify the product 
either by recrystallisation from a small volume of ethanol or preferably by 
distillation under diminished pressure and collect the fraction of b.p. 124— 
125°C/18mmHg or 116-1 17 °C/12mmHg; the distillate solidifies to a pale 
yellow solid, m.p. 44^5 °C. The yield is 35 g (67%), depending upon the 
purity of the original m-nitroaniline. 

Note. (1) The steam distillation may be omitted, if desired, by utilising the following 
method of purification. Allow the reaction mixture to cool, decant the aqueous layer 
and dissolve the residue in about 1 50 ml of toluene. Wash the toluene solution with 
water, 1 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and finally with water; dry with 
magnesium sulphate, distil off the toluene on a water bath (rotary evaporator) and 
distil the residue under diminished pressure. 

o-Chlorobenzoic acid. Dissolve 14 g (0.1 mol) of anthranilic acid (Expt 6.53) 
in a solution of 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 100 ml of water. 
Cool to about 5 °C, and diazotise by the gradual addition of a cold solution of 
7g (0.1 mol) of sodium nitrite in 25 ml of water to an end-point with starch- 
potassium iodide paper (see footnote, p. 921). In the meantime prepare a 
solution of copper(i) chloride as follows. Dissolve 26 g (0.1 04 mol) of

crystallised copper(n) sulphate and 12 g of sodium chloride in 50 ml of water 
in a 750-ml round-bottomed flask. Heat the solution to boiling, then add 
80 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 14 g of copper turnings, and 
continue the heating under reflux until the solution is practically colourless. 
(Alternatively, prepare the copper(i) chloride by the method given in Section 
4.2.22, p. 428.) Cool in ice, and then add the cold diazonium solution slowly 
and with shaking. The reaction proceeds rapidly and with frothing: allow the 
mixture to stand for 2-3 hours with frequent snaking. Filter the precipitated 
o-chlorobenzoic acid and wash it with a little cold water. Recrystallise the 
crude acid from hot water containing a little alcohol to which a little 
decolourising carbon has been added. The yield of pure o-chlorobenzoic acid, 
m.p. 138-139 °C, is 14 g (87%).

Prepare a solution of copper(i) bromide in a 2.5-litre two-necked flask by 
heating under reflux 31.5 g (0.124mol) of copper(n) sulphate pentahydrate, 
lOg (0.158 mol) of copper turnings, 77 g (0.55 mol) of crystallised sodium 
bromide, 15 g (8.2 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid as described in Section 
4.2.27, p. 428. 

In a 1 -litre flask mix 53.5 g (0.5 mol) of p-toluidine and 400 ml of water, and 
then add cautiously 98 g (53.5 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid; warm until 
the p-toluidine dissolves. Cool the flask in a bath of ice and salt to 0-5 °C; add 
about lOOg of crushed ice to the contents of the flask in order to accelerate 
the cooling. Add slowly and with frequent shaking a solution of 35 g (0.5 mol) 
of sodium nitrite in 60 ml of water until a slight excess of sodium nitrite is 
present (see footnote, p. 921); keep the temperature of the mixture below 
10 °C. 

Equip the 2.5-litre two-necked flask containing the copper(i) bromide 
solution for steam distillation (compare Fig. 2.102) and insert into the side- 
neck a tube (7-8 mm in diameter) leading almost to the bottom of the flask 
via a screw-capped adapter; attach a short-stemmed separatory funnel to this 
tube by means of a short length of rubber tubing and support the funnel in a 
ring clamped to a retort stand. Heat the copper(i) bromide solution to 
boiling, add the toluene-p-diazonium sulphate solution from the separatory 
funnel while steam is passed rapidly through the mixture. In order to reduce 
the amount of decomposition of the diazonium salt solution, transfer only 
about one-fourth to the separatory funnel (the remainder being kept in the 
freezing mixture) and run this into the copper(i) bromide solution: when the 
funnel is nearly empty, transfer a further portion of the cold diazonium 
solution to it without interrupting the addition. Add all the diazonium 
solution in this way during 20^30 minutes. Continue the steam distillation 
until no more organic matter distils. Render the distillate alkaline with 20 per 
cent sodium hydroxide solution (to remove any p-cresol present), shake well 
and separate the crude p-bromotoluene. In order to obtain a colourless 
product, wash the crude substance with 40-50 ml of warm (30 °C) concen- 
trated sulphuric acid, then with water, sodium hydroxide solution, and finally 
with water. If the p-bromotoluene solidifies, warm the wash liquids to 30 °C

before use; unless this is done, considerable loss may occur. Dry over 
magnesium sulphate or anhydrous calcium chloride, warm, filter and distil 
through an air-cooled condenser. Coolect the p-bromotoluene at 182-184 °C. 
The yield is 60 g (70%); m.p. 25-26 °C. 

The para-substitution pattern is clearly confirmed by the p.m.r. spectrum 
(CDC1 3 , TMS) which shows signals at 3 2.25 (s, 3H, Me), 6.92 (d, 2H, ortho- 
H's to Me), and 7.30 (d, 2H, ortho-Ws to Br). The ortho and meta isomers 
show multiplets in the aromatic proton region. All the isomers show 
absorption in the 650-830 cm" 1 region of their i.r. spectra (thin film); i.e. at c. 
810 cm" 1 for the para isomer (2 adj. H's), at c. 750 cm" ' for the ortho isomer 
(5 adj. H's), and at c. 770 cm" • (3 adj. H's) and at 830 cm" l (1H) for the meta 
isomer. The m.s. of the isomers are noted in Expt 6.81. 

Cognate preparations. o-Bromotoluene. Use 53.5 g of o-toluidine and other 
components as above. The yield of o-bromotoluene, b.p. 178-181 °C, is of the 
same order. 

o-Bromochlorobenzene. Place a mixture of 64 g (0.5 mol) of o-chloroaniline 
and 175ml of constant boiling point hydrobromic acid (d 1.48; 100ml 
contains 71 g of HBr) in a 1 -litre flask set in an ice-salt bath, and cool it to 
0-5 °C by the addition of a little ice. Add, with shaking or stirring, a solution 
of 35 g (0.5 mol) of sodium nitrite in 70 ml of water until a slight excess of nitrous 
acid is present (starch-potassium iodide paper test; see footnote, p. 921); 
maintain the temperature below 10 °C by the addition of ice if necessary. 

Prepare copper(i) bromide from 75 g (0.33 mol) of crystallised copper(n) 
sulphate as detailed in Section 4.2.21, p. 428, and dissolve it in 40 ml of 48 per 
cent hydrobromic acid; heat the solution to boiling and add o-chlorobenzene- 
diazonium bromide solution as detailed above. When all the latter has been 
introduced, continue to pass steam through the mixture until no more 
organic material distils. Follow the procedure, including purification, given 
for p-bromotoluene. Collect the o-bromochlorobenzene (a colourless liquid) 
at 200-202 °C. The yield is 85 g (89%). 

This procedure may also be employed for m-bromochlorobenzene, b.p. 
191-194 °C, from m-chloroaniline; m-dibromobenzene, b.p. 215-217 °C, from 
m-bromoaniline; and o-bromoanisole, b.p. 114-1 16 °C/29mmHg, from o- 
anisidine (the sulphuric acid washing is omitted in the last example). 

2-Bromonaphthalene. Dissolve 112g (0.5 mol) of 2-naphthylamine-l- 
sulphonic acid (1), with stirring, in 850 ml of 0.6 m sodium hydroxide solution: 
add, with stirring, an aqueous solution of 35 g (0.5 mol) of sodium nitrite, and 
filter the resulting solution. Place 250 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
and 100 g of crushed ice in a 2-litre beaker, and equip the latter with a 
mechanical stirrer. Introduce the filtered solution of sodium nitrite and 
sodium 2-naphthylamine-l-sulphonate (2) slowly with stirring, and maintain 
the temperature at 0-5 °C by adding crushed ice. Collect the reddish-brown 
precipitate which forms on a large Buchner funnel and wash it with about 
500 ml of ice-water. While the diazotisation is in progress, suspend 160g 
(1.1 mol) of copper(i) bromide (from 300 g of crystallised copper(n) sulphate; 
Section 4.2.21, p. 428) in 75 ml of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid and 200 ml of 
water. Add the damp cake of the diazonium compound portionwise and with 
vigorous stirring to the copper(i) bromide suspension contained in a 2-litre

beaker. After the vigorous evolution of nitrogen has subsided heat the 
mixture to 95-100 °C on a steam bath and then filter the hot mixture through 
a large Buchner funnel. Pour the filtrate back into the beaker and add 1 12 g of 
potassium chloride with stirring. Allow the resulting paste to cool to room 
temperature, filter with suction and wash with 250 ml of 20 per cent aqueous 
potassium chloride. Dry the reddish-brown precipitate of 2-bromo- 
naphthalene-1-sulphonic acid in the air overnight, and transfer it to a 
2-litre round-bottomed flask. Add dilute sulphuric acid (prepared from 
200 ml of the concentrated acid and 200 g of crushed ice), attach a reflux 
condenser and reflux the mixture gently, using an electric heating mantle, for 
12-16 hours. Cool to room temperature; pour on to about 500 g of crushed 
ice. Transfer the mixture with the aid of 500 ml of toluene to a large 
separatory funnel, shake well, remove the toluene layer and wash the latter 
with water until the washings are neutral to litmus. Dry the toluene solution 
with magnesium sulphate, remove the toluene using a rotary evaporator and 
distil the residue under reduced pressure. Collect the bromonaphthalene at 
100-101 °C/2mmHg or at 140°C/20mmHg; this solidifies to a pale yellow 
solid, m.p. 56-57 °C. The yield is 67 g (65%). 

The pale yellow colour cannot be removed by redistillation or 
recrystallisation; the coloured product probably contains some amino 
compound rendering it unsuitable for conversion into a Grignard reagent. A 
pure white product may be obtained by the following procedure. Dissolve 
50 g of the coloured compound in 200 ml of hexane and pass the solution 
through a column of activated alumina (80-200 mesh; dimensions about 
9 cm x 3 cm); wash the column with 750 ml of hexane. Remove the hexane by 
distillation: 49 g of pure 2-bromonaphthalene, m.p. 58 °C, remains. This is 
sufficiently pure for use in Grignard reactions.

Anhydrous copper(n) chloride (1.62, 12mmol) (1), t-butyl nitrite (1.55 g,

solution. During this addition the reaction solution turns completely black 
from an initial green colour as nitrogen is evolved (4). After gas evolution is 
complete the reaction is allowed to reach room temperature; the reaction 
solution is then poured into 200 ml of 20 per cent aqueous hydrochloric acid 
and extracted with 200 ml of ether. The organic layer is washed once with

In a 1-or 1.5-litre round-bottomed flask prepare a solution of 53.5 g (0.5 mol) 
of o-toluidine in 170 ml of 40 per cent w/w hydrobromic acid; cool to 5 °C by 
immersion in a bath of ice and salt. Diazotise by the gradual addition of a 
solution of 36.5 g (0.53 mol) of sodium nitrite in 50 ml of water; stopper the 
flask after each addition and shake until all red fumes are absorbed. Keep the 
temperature between 5 and 10 °C. When the diazotisation is complete, add 2 g 
of copper powder or copper bronze (Section 4.2.19, p. 426), attach a reflux 
condenser to the flask and heat very cautiously on a water bath. Immediately 
evolution of gas occurs, cool the flask in crushed ice; unless the flask is rapidly 
removed from the water bath, the reaction may become so violent that the 
contents may be shot out of the flask. When the vigorous evolution of 
nitrogen moderates, heat the flask on a water bath for 30 minutes. Then dilute 
with 400 ml of water, and steam distil the mixture until about 750 ml of 
distillate are collected. Render the distillate alkaline with 10 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution (about 50 ml) and separate the lower red layer of crude o-

add copper powder (Section 4.2.19, p. 426) or copper bronze (previously 
washed with ether) gradually until no more nitrogen is evolved (about 50 g of 
copper powder are required). Filter at the pump and wash the precipitate 
with several small amounts of dilute ammonia solution to remove any 
sulphinic acid which may have separated: add the washings to the filtrate. 
The combined filtrate and washings should be acid to Congo red paper. Treat

Prepare copper(i) cyanide from lOOg (0.4 mol) of hydrated copper(n) 
sulphate following the procedure described in Section 4.2.23, p. 429, transfer 
the product to a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask and dissolve it in a solution of 
52 g of potassium cyanide in 125 ml of water (CAUTION). 

Diazotise 36 g (0.33 mol) of p-toluidine, following the method given under 
p-chlorotoluene (Section 6.71). While keeping the solution cold, carefully add 
about 20 g of powdered anhydrous sodium carbonate with constant stirring 
until the solution is neutral to litmus. Warm the copper(i) cyanide solution 
on a water bath to about 60 °C, and add the cold neutralised diazonium salt 
solution in small quantities at a time, shaking vigorously (1) after each 
addition and taking care to maintain the temperature of the mixture at 60- 
70 °C. Attach a reflux condenser to the flask and heat on a boiling water bath 
for 15-20 minutes in order to complete the reaction. Equip the flask for steam 
distillation (Fig. 2.102), and pass steam into the mixture until no more yellow 
oil passes over; if the oil solidifies in the condenser tube, turn off the 
condenser water, and, after the material melts and flows through, slowly turn 
on the water again. Cool the distillate in ice-water, and when the crude p- 
tolunitrile has solidified, filter it at the pump and press well to remove liquid 
impurities. Dry upon filter paper or in a desiccator. Mix the dried product 
with 2-3 g of decolourising carbon, transfer to a small distilling flask and 
distil using an air condenser. Collect the pure p-tolunitrile at 215-219 °C (2); 
this solidifies on cooling and melts at 29 °C. The yield is 26 g (67%). 

The para-substitution pattern is confirmed by the i.r. and p.m.r. spectra. 
Thus in the i.r. spectrum (melt) absorption may be observed at c. 2200 (CN) 
and 820 cm" 1 (2 adj. H's) together with the characteristic absorption from 
the methyl group and the aromatic ring. The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) 
shows signals at 3 2.41 (s, 3H, Me), 7.23 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to Me), and 7.47 (d,

2H, orr/io-H's to CN). These spectra should be compared to those obtained 
with o-tolunitrile (cognate preparation below). 

Notes. (1) Mechanical stirring is preferable. 

(2) The crude substance may also be distilled under diminished pressure and the p- 

tolunitrile collected at 104-106 °C/20mmHg. 

Cognate preparation. o-Tolunitrile. The preparation is similar to that described 
for p-tolunitrile except that p-toluidine is replaced by o-toluidine. The o- 
tolunitrile is isolated by steam distillation; the oil, which may be dissolved in 
a little toluene, is distilled. The o-tolunitrile passes over as an almost 
colourless liquid at 94-96 °C/20 mmHg. Note the i.r. absorption (thin film) at 
c. 2200 (CN) and 760 cm" 1 (4 adj. H's) together with the expected aromatic 
ring and methyl group absorptions. The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) has 
8 2.51 (s, 3H, Me), and 7.02-7.66 (m, 4H, C AR — H).

CAUTION: This preparation should be carried out in an efficient fume 
cupboard and behind a suitable safety screen. 

Dissolve 46.5 g (45.5 ml, 0.5 ml) of aniline in a mixture of 126 ml of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 126 ml of water contained in a 1-litre 
beaker. Cool to 0-5 °C in a bath of ice and salt, and add a solution of 36.5 g 
(0.53 mol) of sodium nitrite in 75 ml of water in small portions; stir vigorously 
with a thermometer and maintain the temperature below 10 °C, but 
preferably at about 5 °C by the addition of a little crushed ice if necessary. The 
diazotisation is complete when a drop of the solution diluted with 3-4 drops 
of water gives an immediate blue coloration with potassium iodide-starch 
paper; the test should be performed 3-4 minutes after the last addition of the 
nitrite solution. Prepare a solution of 76 g (0.69 mol) of sodium fluoroborate 
(1) in 150 ml of water, cool and add the chilled solution slowly to the 
diazonium salt solution; the latter must be kept well stirred and the 
temperature controlled so that it is below 10 °C. Allow to stand for 10 
minutes with frequent stirring. Filter the precipitated benzenediazonium 
fluoroborate with suction on a Buchner funnel, drain well and wash the 
yellow solid with about 30 ml of ice-water, 1 5 ml of methanol and 30-40 ml of 
ether; suck the solid as free as possible from liquid after each washing (2). 
Spread the salt upon absorbent filter paper and allow to dry overnight, if 
possible in a current of air. The yield of benzenediazonium fluoroborate is 
60-65 g; the pure salt melts with decomposition at 1 19-120 °C. 

Assemble the apparatus shown in Fig. 6.3; this is self-explanatory. The 
distilling flask has a capacity of 250 ml and the beaker contains 150 ml of 10 
per cent sodium hydroxide solution. Place half of the yield of the dry 
benzenediazonium fluoroborate in the distilling flask. Heat the solid gently 
with a small luminous flame at one point near its surface until decomposition 
begins; withdraw the flame and allow the reaction to continue as long as it 
will (3). Continue the cautious heating from time to time as may be necessary 
to keep the reaction going. When the decomposition appears to be complete, 
heat the flask more strongly to drive off any remaining fluorobenzene. Allow 

939 



6.7 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




Fig. 6.3 

to cool, add the other half of the benzenediazonium fluoroborate through a 
glazed paper funnel and decompose it as before; finally heat the flask strongly 
until no more fumes of boron trifluoride are evolved in order to drive off the 
last traces of fluorobenzene. Most of the fluorobenzene collects in the first, 
cooled, receiver. Wash the combined distillates three times with an equal 
volume of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution (4) or until the washings are 
almost colourless; this will remove any phenol present. Remove the last 
sodium hydroxide washing as completely as possbile, and then shake with an 
equal volume of almost saturated salt solution. Dry over anhydrous calcium 
chloride or magnesium sulphate, and distil the fluorobenzene (a colourless 
liquid) at 84-85 °C. The yield is 24 g (50%). 

Notes. (1) The use of sodium fluoroborate solution supersedes the less convenient 
fluoroboric acid and permits the preparation to be carried out in ordinary glass vessels. 
If it is desired to employ fluoroboric acid HBF 4 , it can be prepared by adding 100 g of 
AR boric acid in small proportions to 325 g of AR hydrofluoric acid (40% HF) cooled 
in ice; the hydrofluoric acid is contained in a polypropylene beaker, in a beaker coated 
with wax or in a lead vessel. One-third of the above solution should be employed in 
the preparation. Handle with great care. 

Note on precautions to be adopted when using hydrofluoric acid. Attention is 
directed to the fact that hydrofluoric acid in contact with the skin produces extremely 
painful burns. In case of accident, the burned surface, which becomes white, is held 
under running water until the natural colour returns. A paste made from magnesium 
oxide and glycerine should be applied immediately; this is said to be helpful in 
preventing the burn becoming serious. It is advisable to wear acid-resisting rubber 
gloves and protective goggles. 

(2) Careful washing with methanol and ether is necessary to remove from the crude 
product any moisture which tends to make the material unstable and liable to 
spontaneous decomposition. 

(3) If the reaction becomes too vigorous, it may be necessary to cool the flask by 
covering it with a damp cloth. Normally the decomposition proceeds smoothly under 
the intermittent heating. If the salt is damp, the reaction may proceed more vigorously 
and unless the flask is cooled, it may pass beyond control. 

(4) The density of fluorobenzene is about 1.025 at room temperature; it is important to 
use the correct strength of sodium hydroxide solution in order to obtain a clear 
separation of the layers. 

Cognate preparations. p-Fluorotoluene. Diazotise 53.5 g (0.5 mol) of p- 
toluidine in a mixture of 126 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 126 ml 
of water contained in a 1-litre beaker following the procedure given in Expt 
6.71. Add a chilled solution of 76 g (0.69 mol) of sodium fluoroborate in 
150 ml of water slowly and with good stirring to the cold diazonium salt

solution. Continue stirring for about 15 minutes. Filter the toluene-p- 
diazonium fluoroborate on a Buchner or sintered glass funnel, wash with 
about 30 ml of ice-water, 15 ml of methanol and 30-40 ml of ether. Dry 
overnight upon absorbent paper in a vacuum desiccator or, if possible, in a 
current of air. The yield of toluene-p-diazonium fluoroborate is 78 g (76%); it 
melts with decomposition at 114°C. Decompose the salt in two equal lots, 
and work up as for fluorobenzene. The yield of pure p-fluorotoluene (a 
colourless liquid), b.p. 116-1 17 °C, is 27 g (50%). 

p-Fluoroanisole. To 105 ml (2mol) of c. 42 per cent fluoroboric acid 
(CAUTION: corrosive chemical) diluted with an equal volume of water, 
contained in a 600 ml beaker, add 31 g (0.25 mol) of p-anisidine. Place the 
beaker in an ice bath and stir the solution mechanically. Add a solution of 
17.5 g (0.25 mol) of sodium nitrite in 35 ml of water slowly and maintain the 
temperature at about 10 °C. Stir the solution vigorously towards the end of 
the reaction, cool the mixture to °C and filter with suction on a sintered 
glass funnel. Wash the precipitate successively with 30-40 ml of cold 5 per 
cent fluoroboric acid, 40 ml of ice-cold methanol and several times with ether. 
Dry overnight by spreading the salt thinly on absorbent paper supported 
upon a screen or wire netting allowing circulation underneath. The yield of p- 
methoxybenzenediazonium fluoroborate is 54 g (98%). Decompose the dry 
salt as detailed (or fluorobenzene. Return the small amount of product in the 
receiver to the distilling flask and steam distil. Extract the steam distillate 
with two 50 ml portions of ether, wash the ethereal solution with 50 ml of 10 
per cent sodium hydroxide solution, followed by water and dry over 
magnesium sulphate. Remove the ether on a steam bath and distil the residue. 
Collect the p-fluoroanisole at 156-157 °C. The yield is 16 g (51%).

Dissolve 34 g (0.25 mol) of o-nitroaniline in a warm mixture of 63 ml of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid and 63 ml of water contained in a 600-ml 
beaker. Place the beaker in an ice-salt bath, and cool to 0-5 °C while stirring 
mechanically; the o-nitroaniline hydrochloride will separate in a finely 
divided crystalline form. Add a cold solution of 1 8 g (0.26 mol) of sodium 
nitrite in 40 ml of water slowly and with stirring to an end-point with 
potassium iodide-starch paper; do not allow the temperature to rise above 5- 
7°C. Introduce, while stirring vigorously, a solution of 40 g (0.36 mol) of 
sodium fluoroborate in 80 ml of water. Stir for a further 10 minutes, and filter 
the solid diazonium fluoroborate with suction on a Buchner funnel. Wash it 
immediately once with 25 ml of cold 5 per cent sodium fluoroborate solution, 
then twice with 1 5 ml portions of rectified (or industrial) spirit and several 
times with ether; in each washing stir the fluoroborate well before applying 
suction. The o-nitrobenzenediazonium fluoroborate weighs about 50 g (86%); 
the pure substance melts with decomposition at 135 °C. 

Dissolve 200 g (2.9 mol) of sodium nitrite in 400 ml of water in a 2-litre

beaker provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer, and add 40 g of copper 
powder (either the precipitated powder or copper bronze which has been 
washed with a little ether). Suspend the fluoroborate in about 200 ml of water 
and add it slowly to the well-stirred mixture. Add 4-5 ml of ether from time to 
time to break the froth. The reaction is complete when all the diazonium 
compound has been added. Transfer the mixture to a large flask and steam 
distil until no more solid passes over (about 5 litres of distillate). Filter off the 
crystalline solid in the steam distillate and dry upon filter paper in the air; this 
o-dinitrobenzene (very pale yellow crystals) has m.p. 1 16 °C (i.e. is practically 
pure) and weighs 29 g (69%). It may be recrystallised from ethanol; the 
recrystallised solid melts at 116.5°C. 

The p.m.r. spectrum (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) has 3 8.08 and 8.26 (A 2 B 2 
multiplet, values calculated from a mathematical analysis); this should be 
compared with the para isomer (Me 2 CO), cognate preparation below, which 
has 3 8.50 (s, 4H, A 4 singlet), and with the meta isomer (Fig. 3.64). 

Cognate preparation. p-Dinitrobenzene. Use 34 g (0.25 mol) of p-nitroaniline 
(Expt 6.68) and proceed exactly as above to the point where all the 
suspension of p-nitrobenzenediazonium fluoroborate has been added. Filter 
the reaction mixture with suction, wash the residue well with water, twice 
with 25 ml of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and finally with water. 
Dry the solid at 100-110°C, powder it and extract it with four 150ml 
portions of boiling toluene. Remove the toluene with a rotary evaporator and 
recrystallise the residue from about 120 ml of boiling glacial acetic acid. The 
yield of p-dinitrobenzene (reddish-yellow crystals), m.p. 173 °C, is 30g 
(71.5%). Further recrystallisation from ethanol affords pale yellow crystals 
of the same m.p. The p.m.r. spectrum is noted above.

bromoaniline (Expt 6.67) in the presence of 40 ml of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid and 22.5 ml of water with a concentrated solution of 18.5 g of

cold benzene (CAUTION), stir vigorously and add a solution of 30 g of 
sodium hydroxide in 1 50 ml of water dropwise (during 30-45 minutes) while 
maintaining the temperature at 5-10 °C. Complete the reaction as for 2- 
chlorobiphenyl. The yield of 4-bromobiphenyl, b.p. 170-175 °C/8mmHg, 
m.p. 90 °C (from ethanol), is 25 g (86%). 

4-Chlorobiphenyl (PTC procedure)? Potassium acetate (1.20 g, 0.0122mol) is 
added in one portion to a stirred colourless mixture of 4-chlorobenzene- 
diazonium fluoroborate (1.37g, 0.061 mol) (1) and 18-crown-6 (0.08g, 
0.003 mol) in benzene (60 ml, CAUTION) at 20 °C in a vessel protected from 
the light and purged with nitrogen. The mixture turns yellow immediately, 
and then red within a few minutes. Stirring is continued for 90 minutes, 
followed by filtration to remove the solid. The resulting solution is washed 
with brine, water, and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and the 
solvent removed in vacuo. The resulting red oil is chromatographed on a 
short column of alumina using hexane as eluant from which is obtained 4- 
chlorobiphenyl (0.920 g, 80%), m.p. 76-77 °C. 

Note. (1) The 4-chlorobenzenediazonium fluoroborate may be prepared using the 
conditions described for p-methoxybenzenediazonium fluoroborate, Expt 6.77,

concentrated sulphuric acid to the hot solution via the side-neck and gently 
swirl the'liquid, replace the stopper and heat on a water bath until the clear 
solution boils. Remove the flask from the water bath, and add 3.5 g (0.05 mol) 
of powdered sodium nitrite in two approximately equal portions via the side- 
neck; after each addition, replace the stopper and shake the flask vigorously; 
when the reaction subsides, add the second portion of the sodium nitrite. 
Heat the flask on a boiling water bath as long as gas is evolved; shake well

small quantity of ethanol and then repeatedly with water to remove all the 
sodium sulphate. Dissolve the crude tribromobenzene (7.5 g) in a boiling 
mixture of 120 ml of glacial acetic acid and 30 ml of water (1), boil the 
solution with 2.5 g of decolourising carbon and filter through a hot water 
funnel or a preheated Buchner funnel: allow the solution to cool. Collect the

Note. (1) Rectified spirit may also be employed for crystallisation. 

Cognate preparation. Reductive deamination in dimethylformamide. 31 The 

following procedure has been applied, inter alia, to the deamination of 
4-methyl-2-nitroaniline to w-nitrotoluene, and 2,5-dichloroaniline to p- 
dichlorobenzene. To a rapidly stirred solution of t-butyl nitrite (15mmol) (1) 
in anhydrous dimethylformamide (10 ml, redistilled from calcium hydride) 
heated at 65 °C in a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a 
reflux condenser, addition funnel and gas outlet tube is added the aromatic 
amine (lOmmol) dissolved in the minimum amount of dimethylformamide. 
Gas evolution is immediate, continues throughout the addition steadily, and 
generally is complete 10 minutes after the addition of the amine. Total gas 
evolution is measured on a closed system by water displacement from a 
calibrated burette and is usually 220 ±20 ml per lOmmol of amine. After 
complete gas evolution, the reaction solution, which turns deep red from an 
initial yellow, is cooled and poured into 200 ml of 20 per cent aqueous 
hydrochloric acid. The aqueous solution is extracted with 200 ml of ether and 
the ether extract washed with 200 ml of 20 per cent aqueous hydrochloric 
acid. The resulting ether solution is dried over magnesium sulphate and the 
ether removed under reduced pressure. Solid products are suitably recry- 
stallised and liquid products distilled through a 12.5 cm Vigreux column.

as the temperature falls (1). When the temperature has fallen to about 45 °C, 
add 162.5 g (52.5 ml, 1.01 mol) of bromine from a separatory funnel at such a 
rate that the temperature of the well-stirred mixture is maintained at 50- 
55 °C. A precipitate may separate during the addition which requires 30-40 
minutes, but this dissolves later. Continue the stirring for a further 30 minutes 
after all the bromine has been added. Then pour the reaction mixture in a thin 
stream into a well-stirred mixture of 1 kg of crushed ice and 1 kg of water to 
which 14 g of solid sodium metabisulphite has been added. If the colour of the 
bromine persists, add a little more sodium metabisulphite. Filter the 
crystalline 4-acetamido-3-bromotoluene with suction on a Buchner funnel, 
wash thoroughly with water and press well. Dry in the air until the weight 
does not exceed 250 g (2); further purification is unnecessary before 
proceeding to the next stage. 

4-Amino-3-bromotoluene hydrochloride. Transfer the partially dried 4- 
acetamido-3-bromotoluene to a 1.5-litre round-bottomed flask, add 250 ml of 
rectified spirit and reflux on a water bath until the solid dissolves completely. 
Introduce through the condenser 250 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to 
the boiling solution and continue the refluxing for a further 3 hours. During 
this time crystals of 4-amino-3-bromotoluene hydrochloride separate. Pour 
the hot mixture into a 1-litre beaker and cool thoroughly. Filter the crystals 
of the hydrochloride at the pump through a Buchner funnel and wash rapidly 
with two 50 ml portions of chilled rectified spirit. The yield of the 
hydrochloride is 150 g (67.5%). 

4-Amino-3-bromotoluene. Suspend the hydrochloride in 400 ml of water in a 
1 -litre beaker equipped with a mechanical stirrer. Add a solution of 70 g of 
sodium hydroxide in 350 ml of water. The free base separates as a dark heavy 
oil. After cooling to 1 5-20 °C, transfer the mixture to a separatory funnel and 
run off the crude 4-amino-3-bromotoluene. This weighs 125 g (67%) and can 
be used directly in the next step (3). 

m-Bromotoluene. To a cold mixture of 400 ml of rectified spirit and 100 ml of 
concentrated sulphuric acid contained in a 2.5-litre three-necked flask, 
provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer, add 1 25 g (0.67 mol) of crude 4- 
amino-3-bromotoluene. Stir the solution and cool to 5 °C; then add slowly a 
solution of 74 g (1.07 mol) of pure sodium nitrite in 135 ml of water from a 
separatory funnel taking care that the temperature does not rise above 10 °C. 
Continue the stirring for 20 minutes after all the nitrite solution has been 
added in order to complete the diazotisation (test with potassium iodide- 
starch paper for the presence of free nitrous acid). Add 17.5 g (0.28 mol) of 
copper bronze (which has been washed with ether) or copper powder 
(Section 4.2.19, p. 426) to the diazotised solution, and replace the stirrer by a 
long double surface condenser. Have an ice bath at hand to cool the flask if 
the reaction becomes too vigorous. Warm the flask cautiously on a water bath 
until a vigorous evolution of gas commences, then immerse at once in an ice 
bath to prevent loss through the condenser by too rapid evolution of nitrogen 
and acetaldehyde. When the reaction has subsided, again warm the flask 
gently, and finally heat on a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. At the end of 
the reaction, the colour of the solution changes from reddish-brown to 
yellow. Add 1 litre of water and steam distil the mixture as long as oily drops

pass over. Separate the heavy yellow oil, wash it with two 100 ml portions of 
10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, once with 50 ml of water, twice with 
75 ml portions of ice-cold concentrated sulphuric acid, once with 50 ml of 
water, and finally with 50 ml of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution. Dry 
with 2-3 g of magnesium sulphate or anhydrous calcium chloride, and filter 
through a little glass wool into a distilling flask. Distil, using an air condenser, 
and collect the m-bromotoluene (a colourless liquid) at 180-183 °C. The yield 
is 65 g (38% overall). 

The essential i.r. and p.m.r. features for m-bromotoluene are noted in Expt 
6.72. The m.s. of all the isomers shows principal fragment ions at mjz 172 (M, 
81 Br), 170 (M, 79 Br), 91 (M - 8179 Br), and 65 (91 - C 2 H 2 ). 

Notes. (1) If the mixture is cooled in ice, most of the p-acetotoluidide separates out in 
a crystalline form. It may be recrystallised from ethanol. 

(2) Unless the material is at least partly dried before hydrolysis, the yield of 
hydrochloride is reduced because of its solubility. If pure 4-acetamido-3- 
bromotoluene is required, the crude material may be recrystallised from 50 per cent 
ethanol with the addition of a little decolourising carbon; it separates as colourless 
needles, m.p. 116-117°C (180 g, 79%). 

(3) If pure 4-amino-3-bromotoluene is required, the crude base may be purified either 
by steam distillation or, more satisfactorily, by distillation under reduced pressure. 
The oil is dried with 5 g of sodium hydroxide pellets, and fractionally distilled under 
reduced pressure: a little p-toluidine may be present in the low boiling point fraction, 
and the pure substance is collected at 92-94 °C/13 mmHg or at 120-122 °C/30 mmHg. 
The purified amine solidifies on cooling and melts at 17-18 °C. 

6.7.2 COUPLING REACTIONS 

Azo compounds are prepared by the interaction of a diazonium salt with a 
phenol in the presence of sodium hydroxide or with an amine in the presence of 
sodium acetate. The coupling reaction is an electrophilic substitution involving 
the diazonium ion which reacts at the position of greatest electron availability, 
i.e. the position ortho or para to the electron releasing phenoxy or amino groups.

2-Naphthol couples in the more reactive 1 -position as in the synthesis of 1- 
phenylazo-2-naphthol (Expt 6.82). 1-Naphthol couples almost exclusively in 
position 4; when the diazo component is the p-nitrobenzenediazonium ion the 
product is Magneson II (Expt 6.83), which is employed as a test reagent for 
magnesium.

These simpler azo compounds are not of great practical value as dyestuffs 
owing to their slight solubility in water. The introduction of a sulphonic acid 
group into the molecule has no effect upon the colour, but renders the dye 
water-soluble - a fact of great commercial value. The simplest way of achieving 
this is to employ an amine, e.g. sulphanilic acid, in which the — S0 3 H group is 
already present. 

Sulphanilic acid, which has a dipolar or zwitterion structure (Section 6.6.1, p. 
908), is sparingly soluble in water. It is best diazotised by bringing it into 
solution as the sodium salt by adding the calculated quantity of sodium 
carbonate, introducing the requisite quantity of sodium nitrite and pouring the 
solution on to a mixture of hydrochloric acid and ice; nitrous acid and the 
dipolar sulphanilic acid are liberated together and immediately react, and after a 
short time the internal diazonium salt separates from solution. Coupling with 2- 
naphthol in sodium hydroxide solution yields the useful dyestuff Orange II 
(Expt 6.84). When, Af,AT-dimethylaniline is used as the coupling component the 
product is methyl orange (Expt 6.85). This latter substance is more useful as an 
indicator than as a dye, for it changes colour at a certain concentration of 
hydrogen ions (pH 3.1-4.4). Treatment of a solution of methyl orange with a 
strong acid gives rise to a red form - which is essentially an internal salt 
stabilised by electron delocalisation.

It is interesting to note that azo compounds may be conveniently reduced 
either by a solution of tin(n) chloride in hydrochloric acid or by sodium di- 
thionite. Thus l-phenylazo-2-naphthol yields both aniline and l-amino-2- 
naphthol, and methyl orange gives p-amino-AT,Af-dimethylaniline and sulphani- 
lic acid.

Attention has previously been drawn (Section 6.7.1, p. 922) to the fact that 
unless an excess of hydrochloric (or mineral) acid is used in the diazotisation 
process, coupling occurs between the diazonium salt and the amino group in the 
amine to give diazoamino compounds. Thus benzenediazonium chloride and 
aniline yield diazoaminobenzene. This substance may be conveniently prepared 
by dissolving two equivalents of aniline in three equivalents of hydrochloric 
acid, and adding one equivalent of sodium nitrite in aqueous solution followed 
by two equivalents of sodium acetate (Expt 6.86). 

If diazoaminobenzene is dissolved in aniline, to which a small quantity of aniline 
hydrochloride has been added, and the mixture kept at about 40 °C for a short 
time, it is converted into p-aminoazobenzene (Expt 6.86). The mechanism of this 
diazoamino-aminoazo rearrangement is dependent on (a) the heterolytic cleavage 
of a protonated diazoaminobenzene molecule to yield the benzenediazonium 
ion and aniline, and (b) a recoupling reaction, under weakly acidic conditions, of 
the diazonium ion at the para position of aniline.

hydroxide solution in a 250-ml beaker; cool the solution to 5°C by 
immersion in an ice bath, assisted by the direct addition of about 25 g of 
crushed ice. Stir the naphthol solution vigorously and add the cold 
diazonium salt solution very slowly: a red colour develops and red crystals of 
l-phenylazo-2-naphthol soon separate. When all the diazonium salt solution 
has been added, allow the mixture to stand in an ice bath for 30 minutes with 
occasional stirring. Filter the solution through a Buchner funnel with gentle 
suction, wash well with water and drain thoroughly by pressing the crystals 
with the back of a large glass stopper. Recrystallise one-fourth of the product 
from glacial acetic acid (30-35 ml): retain the remainder for reduction by 
stannous chloride. Filter the recrystallised product with suction, wash with a 
little ethanol (or industrial spirit) to eliminate acetic acid and dry upon filter 
paper. The yield of deep red crystals is about 3g. Pure l-phenylazo-2- 
naphthol has m.p. 131 °C; if the m.p. is low, recrystallise the dry product from 
ethanol. 

Reduction with tin(n) chloride. l-Amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride. Into a 350- 
or 500-ml round-bottomed flask, provided with a reflux condenser and 
containing 100 ml of industrial spirit, place the crude l-phenylazo-2-naphthol 
reserved above and boil gently until most of the azo compound has dissolved. 
Meanwhile dissolve 20 g of a good grade of tin(n) chloride in 60 ml of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid (warming is necessary to produce a clear 
solution) (1), add this to the contents of the flask and boil under reflux for a 
further 30 minutes. All the azo compound dissolves rapidly and is reduced by 
the tin(n) chloride; the solution acquires a very pale brown colour. Decant the 
solution to a beaker and cool in ice: the l-amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride 
separates as fine greyish-white crystals. Filter with suction, and wash with 
dilute hydrochloric acid (1:4). Recrystallise from the minimum volume of hot 
water which contains a few drops of tin(n) chloride solution in an equal 
weight of hydrochloric acid (this reduces atmospheric oxidation), cool the 
clear solution in an ice bath and collect the recrystallised product as before. 
Dry the colourless crystals in a desiccator. The yield is 3-4 g. The compound 
will remain colourless, or nearly so, if protected from light during storage.

a 600-ml beaker, cool to 5 °C and pour in, with stirring, the well-mixed 
suspension of diazotised sulphanilic acid. Coupling takes place readily and 
the dyestuff separates as a crystalline paste. Stir well and, after 10 minutes, 
heat the mixture until all the solid has dissolved. Add 20 g of sodium chloride 
(to decrease the solubility of the product further) and warm until this 
dissolves. Allow the solution to cool spontaneously in the air for 1 hour, and 
then cool in ice until crystallisation is complete. Collect the product on a 
Buchner funnel and apply gentle suction; wash with a little saturated salt 
solution, and dry at 80 °C. The product weighs about 22 g, and contains 
about 20 per cent of sodium chloride; further purification is unnecessary for 
dyeing purposes. To obtain pure, crystalline Orange II, dissolve the crude 
substance in the minimum volume of boiling water, allow to cool to about 
80 °C, add about twice the volume of rectified (or industrial) spirit and allow

In a 250-ml conical flask place 10.5 g (0.05 mol) of sulphanilic acid dihydrate,

beaker containing 10.5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 60 g of 
crushed ice (1). Test for the presence of free nitrous acid with potassium 
iodide-starch paper after 15 minutes. Fine crystals of the diazobenzene 
sulphonate will soon separate; do not filter these off as they will dissolve 
during the next stage of the preparation. Dissolve 6.05 g (6.3 ml, 0.05 mol) of 
dimethylaniline in 3.0 ml of glacial acetic acid, and add it with vigorous 
stirring to the suspension of diazotised sulphanilic acid. Allow the mixture to 
stand for 10 minutes; the red or acid form of methyl orange will gradually 
separate. Then add slowly and with stirring 35 ml of 20 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution: the mixture will assume a uniform orange colour due to 
the separation of the sodium salt of methyl orange in fine particles. Direct 
filtration of the latter is slow, hence, while stirring the mixture with a 
thermometer, heat it almost to the boiling point. Most of the methyl orange 
will dissolve. Add about 10 g of sodium chloride (to assist the subsequent 
separation of the methyl orange) and warm at 80-90 °C until the salt has 
dissolved. Allow the mixture to cool undisturbed for 15 minutes and then 
cool in ice-water; this gives a fairly easily filterable product. Filter off the 
methyl orange at the pump, but apply only gentle suction so as to avoid 
clogging the pores of the filter paper; rinse the beaker with a little saturated 
salt solution and drain well. Recrystallise from hot water (about 1 50 ml are 
required); filter the hot solution, if necessary, through a hot water funnel or 
through a preheated Buchner funnel. Reddish-orange crystals of methyl 
orange separate as the solution cools. Filter these at the pump, drain well, 
wash with a little ethanol, and finally with a small volume of ether. The yield 
is 13 g (80%). Methyl orange, being a salt, has no well-defined m.p. 

Note. (1) An alternative procedure is to cool the solution containing the sodium 
sulphanilate and sodium nitrite in a bath of crushed ice to about 5 °C and then add 
10.5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid diluted with an equal volume of water 
slowly and with stirring; the temperature must not be allowed to rise above 10 °C and 
an excess of nitrous acid should be present (the solution is tested after standing for 5 
minutes). The subsequent stages in the preparation - addition of dimethylaniline 
solution, etc. - are as above.

Extract the cold solution with three or four 20 ml portions of ether, dry the 
extract with anhydrous potassium carbonate and remove the ether by 
distillation. The residual base soon crystallises, particularly if it is stirred with 
a glass rod; it melts at 41 °C. 

Method 2. Suspend 2.0 g of methyl orange in 4 ml of water, and add a small 
quantity of sodium dithionite (Na 2 S 2 4 ). Heat the mixture and add more 
sodium dithionite until the colour is discharged. The sulphanilic acid remains 
in the solution as sodium sulphanilate and the p-aminodimethylaniline may 
be extracted with ether as in Method 1.

water during 5 minutes. A yellow precipitate of diazoaminobenzene begins to 
form immediately; allow to stand with frequent shaking for 45 minutes and 
do not allow the temperature to rise above 20 °C (add ice, if necessary). Filter 
the yellow diazoaminobenzene on a Buchner funnel, wash it with 250 ml of 
cold water, drain as completely as possible and spread it on a sheet of filter 
paper to dry. The yield of crude diazoaminobenzene, m.p. 91 °C, is 13 g (87%) 
(2). Recrystallise a small portion from light petroleum, b.p. 60-80 °C: the pure

Notes. (1) For preparations on a larger scale, mechanical stirring is recommended. 
(2) The crude compound may be employed in the preparation of p-aminoazobenzene. 

Conversion into p-aminoazobenzene. Dissolve 5g (0.025 mol) of finely 
powdered diazoaminobenzene in 12-15 g of aniline in a small flask and add 
2.5 g of finely powdered aniline hydrochloride (1). Warm the mixture, with 
frequent shaking, on a water bath at 40-45 °C for 1 hour. Allow the reaction 
mixture to stand for 30 minutes. Then add 1 5 ml of glacial acetic acid diluted 
with an equal volume of water: stir or shake the mixture in order to remove 
the excess of aniline in the form of its soluble acetate. Allow the mixture to 
stand, with frequent shaking, for 15 minutes: filter the aminoazobenzene at 
the pump, wash with a little water and dry upon filter paper. Recrystallise the 
crude p-aminoazobenzene (3.5 g, 70%; m.p. 120 °C) from 15-20ml of carbon 
tetrachloride to obtain the pure compound, m.p. 125 °C. Alternatively, the 
compound may be recrystallised from dilute ethanol, to which a few drops of 
concentrated ammonia solution have been added. 

To prepare the hydrochloride dissolve about 1 g of the compound (which 
need not be perfectly dry) in about 8 ml of ethanol. Add this solution to

water). Boil for 5 minutes, filter the hot solution if necessary and allow to cool. 
p-Aminoazobenzene hydrochloride separates in steel-blue crystals. Filter, 
wash with a little dilute hydrochloric acid, and dry. 

To recover the free base, dissolve the hydrochloride in the minimum

until a clear solution results and the blue colour has become light brown. Add 
water carefully until a cloudiness appears, warm on a water bath until the 
cloudiness just disappears and allow to cool. Yellow crystals of p- 
aminoazobenzene separate on cooling. 

Note. (1) The aniline hydrochloride may be prepared by treating 2 g of aniline with an

6.8.1 INTERMEDIATE PRODUCTS IN THE REDUCTION OF NITRO COMPOUNDS 

The reduction of an aromatic nitro compound with a powerful reducing agent 
(tin or tin(n) chloride and hydrochloric acid; iron and dilute hydrochloric acid; 
hydrogen and a platinum catalyst) leads to a good yield of primary amine, e.g. 
aniline from nitrobenzene. By the use of milder reducing agents and by the 
control of the hydrogen ion concentration of the solution, a number of 
intermediate products may be isolated, some of which are products of direct 
reduction and others are formed through secondary reactions. The various 
stages of the reduction of nitrobenzene have been established by investigating 
the process electrolytically under conditions of varying pH, current density and 
electrode construction and composition. The sequence is as follows.

The various intermediate compounds may be prepared in the laboratory, and 
convenient methods are described below. 

Af-Phenylhydroxylamine (Expt 6.87) is formed when nitrobenzene is treated 
with a 'neutral' reducing agent, e.g. zinc powder and aqueous ammonium 
chloride solution. The compound rearranges, in the presence of acids, with the 
formation of p-aminophenol (Expt 6.87). 

Af-Phenylhydroxylamine may be converted into an Af-benzoyl derivative by 
treating it in aqueous solution with benzoyl chloride while simultaneously 
removing, with sodium hydrogen carbonate, the liberated hydrogen chloride. 32 
On reaction with thionyl chloride this benzoyl derivative is converted into o- 
chlorobenzanilide (Expt 6.61) by way of an intermediate chlorosulphite ester, 
which then undergoes a specific ortho rearrangement. 25

Nitrosobenzene (Expt 6.88) may be obtained by the oxidation of N- 
phenylhydroxylamine with acid dichromate solution at °C. The solid product 
is colourless and is probably a dimer; it dissociates to a green monomer upon 
melting or in solution. 

Azoxybenzene is readily prepared by reduction of nitrobenzene in an alkaline 
medium with a variety of mild reducing agents. Reducing sugars have been used 
successfully for the reduction of substituted nitro compounds to the correspond- 
ing azoxyarenes 33 and the use of D-glucose for the reduction of nitrobenzene is 
illustrated in Expt 6.89. 

Reduction of nitrobenzene in methanolic or ethanolic sodium hydroxide 
solution with zinc powder leads to azobenzene or hydrazobenzene according to 
the proportion of zinc powder employed (Expts. 6.90 and 6.91). Hydrazoben- 
zene may be oxidised to azobenzene by sodium hypobromite solution at °C 

In the presence of acids, hydrazobenzene rearranges to give a mixture 
containing about 70 per cent of benzidine (4,4'-diaminobiphenyl) and about 30 
per cent of 2,4'-diaminobiphenyl (diphenyline), the benzidine rearrangement. 
Benzidine is carcinogenic and its preparation and storage is under strict control.

In a 2-litre beaker, equipped with a thermometer and mechanical stirrer, 
place 25 g of ammonium chloride, 800ml of water and 50g (41.6 ml, 0.41 mol) 
of redistilled nitrobenzene. Stir the mixture vigorously, and add 59 g 
(0.83 mol) of zinc powder of 90 per cent purity (Section 4.2.50, p. 467) during 
about 15 minutes; the rate of addition should be such that the temperature 
rapidly rises to 60-65 °C and remains in this range until all the zinc has been 
added. Continue the stirring for a further 15 minutes, by which time the 
reduction is complete as is shown by the fact that the temperature commences 
to fall. Filter the warm reaction mixture at the pump to remove the zinc 
oxide, and wash it with 100 ml of hot water. Place the filtrate in a conical 
flask, saturate it with common salt (about 300 g) and cool in an ice bath for at 
least 1 hour to ensure maximum crystallisation of the desired product. 
Filter the pale yellow crystals of phenylhydroxylamine with suction and drain 
well. The yield of crude, dry product is about 38 g; this contains a little salt 
and corresponds to about 29 g (66%) of pure phenylhydroxylamine as 
determined by its separation from inorganic materials by dissolution in ether. 
The substance deteriorates upon storage and is therefore used immediately 
for a secondary preparation (e.g. nitrosobenzene, Expt 6.88). If required 
perfectly pure, it may be recrystallised from benzene-light petroleum (b.p. 40- 
60 °C) or from benzene alone; the resulting pure compound is somewhat 
more stable and has a melting point of 81 °C. 

/V-Benzoylation of phenylhydroxylamine. 32 Phenylhydroxylamine (10g, 
0.105 mol) is dissolved in warm water (400 ml) and the solution cooled to 
room temperature and filtered if necessary. Benzoyl chloride (15g, 0.1 06 mol, 
CAUTION) is added in small portions to the solution which is vigorously 
shaken; the acidity of the solution is monitored with litmus paper and 
neutralised by the addition of appropriate quantities of sodium hydrogen 
carbonate solution (1). After several minutes an off-white solid separates. 
When the smell of benzoyl chloride has disappeared and the aqueous 
solution remains alkaline, the benzoylation reaction is complete; a small 
portion of the solution gives a negative reaction on warming with Fehling's 
solution. The solid is filtered and washed with water and finally well 
triturated with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution to remove any occluded 
acid (2). The crude product is boiled with water in which the monobenzoate is 
soluble but the dibenzoate remains as a dark brown oil. After decantation 
and cooling the monobenzoate separates as white needles, m.p. 121-122 °C. 

Notes. (1) An alternative procedure 34 is to add the benzoyl chloride in ether to a 

stirred suspension of phenylhydroxylamine in ether at °C. When the reaction is 

complete the ether solution is washed with dilute alkali and water, dried and 

evaporated. 

(2) Further purification may be effected by dissolving the crude product in aqueous 

ammonia (28%), in which the dibenzoate is insoluble, filtering, and acidifying with 

sulphuric acid, 32 or better hydrochloric acid. 35

nitrosobenzene or nitrobenzene (c. 10-15 minutes). Neutralise the cold 
reaction mixture with sodium hydrogen carbonate, saturate with salt, extract

In a 2-litre beaker, equipped with a thermometer and mechanical stirrer, 
place 30 g (0. 56 mol) of ammonium chloride, 1 litre of water and 6 1 . 5 g (5 1 ml, 
0.5 mol) of pure nitrobenzene. Stir the mixture vigorously, and add 75 g 
(1.03 mol, 90% purity; see Section 4.2.50, p. 467) of zinc powder during about 
15 minutes; the rate of addition should be such that the temperature rises 
rapidly to 60-65 °C and remains in this range until all the zinc has been 
added. Continue the stirring for a further 15 minutes, by which time the 
reduction is complete as shown by the fact that the temperature commences 
to fall. Filter the warm reaction mixture at the pump to remove the zinc 
oxide, and wash it with 600-700 ml of boiling water. Transfer the filtrate and 
washings to a 4-litre round-bottomed flask or beaker and cool immediately to 
0-1 °C by the addition of sufficient crushed ice and leave at least 250 g 
unmelted. Without delay, add with stirring a cold solution of concentrated 
sulphuric acid (150 ml of the concentrated acid added to sufficient ice to 
reduce its temperature to — 5 °C). Then add an ice-cold solution of 34 g 
(0. 1 14 mol) of crystallised sodium dichromate in 1 25 ml of water as rapidly as 
possible to the stirred solution. After 2-3 minutes, filter the straw-coloured 
precipitate of nitrosobenzene on a Buchner funnel and wash it with 200 ml of 
water. Steam distil the nitrosobenzene as rapidly as possible; the nitro- 
sobenzene tends to decompose at the elevated temperature. Cool the receiver 
in ice because the compound has a high vapour pressure at room 
temperature. The nitrosobenzene condenses to a green liquid, which solidifies 
to a white solid; care should be taken that the solid does not clog the 
condenser by turning off the water supply from time to time. Stop the 
distillation when yellow oily material appears in the condenser. Filter; grind 
the nitrosobenzene in a glass mortar with a little water. Filter at the pump, 
wash it with water until the washings are no longer brown and drain as 
completely as possible. Dry the solid between layers of filter paper. The yield 
of nitrosobenzene, m.p. 66-67 °C, is 30 g (56%). A pure product, m.p. 68 °C, 
may be obtained by recrystallisation from a small volume of ethanol with 
good cooling: the compound should be dried over anhydrous calcium 
chloride at atmospheric pressure. The substance may be kept 1-2 days at 
room temperature and for longer periods at °C.

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with an efficient stirrer (e.g. a Hershberg

(17.1 ml, 0.167 mol) of pure nitrobenzene in the flask, immerse it in a water

in small portions, with continuous stirring, during 1 hour. Then heat on a 
boiling water bath for 2 hours. Pour the hot mixture into a 1 -litre round- 
bottomed flask and steam distil (Fig. 2.102) to remove aniline and 
nitrobenzene. When the distillate is clear (i.e. after about 1 litre has been 
collected), pour the residue into a beaker cooled in an ice bath. The 
azoxybenzene soon solidifies. Filter with suction, grind the lumps of 
azoxybenzene in a mortar, wash with water and dry upon filter paper or upon 
a porous plate. The yield of material, m.p. 35-35.5 °C, is 13 g (79%).

in order to melt the azobenzene and stir mechanically for 5 minutes; continue 
the stirring while the mixture is immersed in ice-water in order to solidify the 
azobenzene. Filter, wash well with water, drain thoroughly and recrystallise 
from a mixture of 145 ml of rectified spirit and 12 ml of water; collect the 
azobenzene and dry in the air. The yield of pure azobenzene (reddish-orange

Notes. (1) At the end of this time, the reddish mixture should be free from the odour of 
nitrobenzene; if it is not, reflux for 2-3 hours longer. 

(2) Frequently the recrystallized azobenzene has m.p. 61 °C, which is unaffected by 
recrystallisation from ethanol. Upon distillation from a 50-ml distilling flask fitted 
with a short air condenser, the m.p. is raised to 67.5 °C and the recovery is about 90

Support a 1 500-ml three-necked flask, equipped with a sealed stirrer unit and

84g of sodium hydroxide in 185ml of water, 50g (41.5ml, 0.406 mol) of 
nitrobenzene and 500 ml of methanol in the flask. Add 78 g (1.07 mol, 90%) of 
zinc powder, start the stirrer and reflux for 10 hours. The solution gradually 
assumes the reddish colour of azobenzene and then, on further reduction, 
turns to a pale yellow (due to hydrazobenzene). If the colour is not almost 
completely discharged at the end of the refluxing period, add a further 1 1 g 
(0.15 mol; 90%) of zinc powder, and reflux for 2-3 hours longer. Filter the hot 
solution through a preheated Buchner funnel and wash the sodium zincate 
upon the filter with a little hot methanol. Pour the filtrate into a large flask 
(1), stopper it loosely and cool it in a freezing mixture of ice and salt to 
accelerate crystallisation. After 1 hour filter off the almost colourless crystals 
of hydrazobenzene at the pump as rapidly as possible (it is helpful to displace 
the air above the solution undergoing filtration in the funnel with a stream of 
nitrogen), wash with 50 per cent methanol to which a little sulphurous acid 
has been added until the filtrate is no longer alkaline. Dry in a vacuum 
desiccator. The resulting almost colourless hydrazobenzene (15 g; 40%; m.p. 
125 °C) is sufficiently pure for most preparative purposes. If it is required pure 
(m.p. 126 °C with production of a yellow colour), it may be recrystallised 
from hot methanol containing a little ammonium sulphide or sulphurous 
acid (these assist in preventing atmospheric oxidation). 

Owing to the great tendency of hydrazobenzene to undergo oxidation, all 
operations involving filtration should be carried out as rapidly as possible 
and air should not be drawn through it unnecessarily. The substance should 
be dried in a vacuum desiccator: it can only be preserved in a colourless 
condition if it is kept in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide or nitrogen or in 
sealed vessels. The u.v.-visible spectrum is quoted in Expt 6.89. 

Notes. (1) If the methanol is distilled off before thorough cooling in a freezing mixture, 
the yield of hydrazobenzene is appreciably increased, but the product is considerably 
more coloured due to admixture with a trace of azobenzene. About 12 g of impure 



958 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.S 



hydrazobenzene may be recovered by distilling off the methanol from the filtrate after 
the colourless hydrazobenzene has been collected. 



6.8.2 ARYLHYDRAZINES 

Arylhydrazines may be prepared by reducing diazonium salts with excess warm 
sodium sulphite solution, followed by acidification with hydrochloric acid. The 
hydrochloride usually crystallises out on cooling and treatment of the latter with 
excess sodium hydroxide solution liberates the free base. The preparation of p- 
nitrophenylhydrazine by this method is illustrated in Expt 6.92. 

The mechanism of this reduction probably involves the initial addition of a 
sulphite ion to the diazonium group to give an azosulphonate which undergoes 
further conjugate (1,4-) addition of the nucleophilic sulphite ion. The resulting 
intermediate is protonolytically cleaved on heating under acidic conditions:

This method cannot be applied to polynitro amines, since these are so weakly 
basic that they can be diazotised only under special conditions in strongly acidic 
media (Section 6.7.1, p. 922). In such cases use may be made of the susceptibility 
to nucleophilic displacement of halogen when activated by ortho and para nitro 
groups. Thus the valuable reagent 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (Expt 6.93) is 
readily prepared by reacting l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene with hydrazine. Reac- 
tion with ammonia similarly gives 2,4-dinitroaniline (cognate preparation in 
Expt 6.93).

A further example is provided by the reaction of 1-chloro- 2,4,6-

oxidation with lead dioxide yields the highly stable AT,AT-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl 
radical, which is obtained as an intensely coloured, paramagnetic solid. 
Stabilisation of the radical is promoted by the strongly electron-attracting 
trinitrophenyl residue resulting in extensive delocalisation of the odd electron. 
The Af,Af-diphenylhydrazine required for this preparation is obtained by 
reduction of Af-nitroso-AT,Af-diphenylamine with zinc and acetic acid (Expt 
6.95).

Dissolve lOg (0.075 mol) of p-nitroaniline (Expt 6.68) in a mixture of 21 ml of

rapidly to 0°C in order to obtain the hydrochloride of the base in a fine state 
of division. Diazotise in the usual way (see Expt 6.70) by the gradual addition 
of a solution of 5.2 g (0.075 mol) of sodium nitrite in 12 ml of water. Continue 
the stirring for a few minutes, filter the solution rapidly and add it from a 
separatory funnel to an ice-cold solution of 41 g (0.156 mol) of sodium 
sulphite (96% Na 2 S0 3 -7H 2 0) in 100 ml of water containing 4g of sodium 
hydroxide; stir the mixture during the addition which requires about 5 
minutes. (If the diazonium solution is added too rapidly, an orange-red 
precipitate of sodium p-nitrobenzenediazosulphonate is produced, and is apt 
to form a resin.) Allow the solution to stand for 5 minutes, acidify with 70 ml 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heat on a water bath at 25 °C for 3 
minutes, when yellow needles commence to separate. Allow to stand 
overnight, filter off the crystals, heat them with 20 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid on a water bath for 7 minutes and allow to cool. Filter off 
the precipitate, consisting of p-nitrophenylhydrazine hydrochloride and 
sodium salts, dissolve it in water and treat the solution with a concentrated 
solution of sodium acetate: the free base will separate out in an almost pure 
state (7-8 g, 63-72%). The p-nitrophenylhydrazine may be recrystallised from 
ethanol and is obtained as light brown crystals, m.p. 158 °C (decomp.).

wash with 50 ml of warm (60 °C) rectified spirit to remove unchanged 
chlorodinitrobenzene, and then with 50 ml of hot water. The resulting 2,4- 
dinitrophenylhydrazine (30 g, 60%) melts at 191-192 °C (decomp.), and is 
pure enough for most purposes. Distil off half the alcohol from the filtrate and 
thus obtain a less pure second crop (about 12g): recrystallise this from butan- 
l-ol (30 ml per gram). If pure 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine is required, 
recrystallise the total yield from butan-1-ol or from dioxane (10 ml per gram): 
this melts at 200 °C (decomp.). 

The following alternative method of preparation is recommended. Dis- 
solve 50g of purified chlorodinitrobenzene (1) in 100 ml of triethylene glycol 
(gentle warming may be necessary; alternatively, 125 ml of warm diethylene 
glycol may be used) in a 600-ml beaker and cool, with mechanical stirring, in 
an ice bath to 15-18 °C. Place 15 ml of commercial 60-65 per cent hydrazine 
solution in a small separatory funnel supported over the beaker. Add the 
hydrazine solution to the stirred solution in the beaker at such a rate that the 
temperature is maintained between 1 5 and 20 °C (20-30 minutes). When the 
exothermic reaction is over, digest the paste on a boiling water bath with 
50 ml of methanol for 15-20 minutes. Cool the reaction mixture, filter with 
suction and wash with a little methanol. Dry at 100 °C. The yield of 2,4- 
dinitrophenylhydrazine, m.p. 192-193 °C (decomp.), is 46 g (93%). The 
product is pure enough for most purposes: the pure compound may be 
obtained by recrystallisation from butan-1-ol or from dioxane as described 
above. 

Cognate preparation. 2,4-Dinitroaniline. Place a mixture of 18 g of 
ammonium acetate and 50 g (0.246 mol) of commercial l-chloro-2,4- 
dinitrobenzene (1) in a 250-ml two-necked flask, and fit it with a reflux 
condenser and inlet tube (at least 2 cm diameter in order to prevent clogging) 
which terminates just above the surface of the reaction mixture. Half immerse 
the flask in an oil bath. Pass ammonia gas (from a cylinder) through a bubble 
counter, which contains a solution of 3 g of potassium hydroxide in 2.5 ml of 
water, into the mixture. Heat the oil bath to 170 °C, and pass the ammonia 
gas at the rate of 3-4 bubbles per second for 6 hours. Allow the reaction 
mixture to cool, break up the solid cautiously with a glass rod, add 100 ml of 
water, heat to boiling and filter while hot. Dissolve the residue in 500 ml of 
boiling rectified (or industrial) spirit, and add water (c. 150 ml) until the 
solution becomes turbid; heat until the turbidity disappears and allow the 
clear solution to cool overnight. Filter the crystals at the pump and dry in an 
oven. The yield is 35 g (78%), m.p. 176-177 °C. To obtain a perfectly pure 
product, recrystallise again from ethanol and water; use 20 ml of ethanol per 
gram of solid: 31.5 g of pure 2,4-dinitroaniline, m.p. 180 °C, are thus obtained. 
The p.m.r. spectrum (Me 2 CO-d 6 ; saturated solution, TMS) provides an 
excellent example of a first-order analysis from which coupling constants may 
be measured and interrelated; 5 3.08 (s, 2H, NH 2 ), 7.22 (d, 1H, C 6 — H), 8.20

6.8.3 ARYLUREAS AND RELATED COMPOUNDS 

AT-Arylureas are obtained when salts of primary aromatic amines react with 
solutions of alkali metal cyanates. The process involves the rearrangement of an 
amine cyanate, and is analogous to Wohlers' classical synthesis of urea from 
ammonium cyanate. 

Ar-NH 3 }CNO &gt; Ar-NH-CONH 2 

The reaction is most conveniently carried out by warming the amine in aqueous 
solution with the equivalent quantity of sodium cyanate and an excess of acetic 
acid (Expt 6.96, Method 1). 

In an alternative synthesis (Expt 6.96, Method 2), which is also convenient for 
the synthesis of alkylureas, the amine hydrochloride is heated in aqueous 
solution with urea. This reaction also probably involves the amine cynate since 
in aqueous solution urea serves as a source of ammonium cyanate.

sym.-Diarylthioureas (3) (e.g. sym.-diphenylthiourea or thiocarbanilide, Expt

Upon heating the diarylthiourea with concentrated hydrochloric acid, it is 
partly converted into the aryl isothiocyanate (e.g. phenyl isothiocyanate or 
phenyl mustard oil, Expt 6.98, Method 1). A little hydrogen sulphide is evolved 
in a side reaction forming diphenylcarbodi-imide (4) which undergoes nu- 
cleophilic addition of aniline to yield triphenylguanidine (5), isolated from the 
reaction mixture as the hydrochloride.

Phenyl isothiocyanate may be prepared in quantity (Expt 6.98, Method 2) by 
allowing aniline to react with carbon disulphide to form phenyldithiocarbamic 
acid (cf. 1), which is isolated as the ammonium salt. Treatment of the latter with 
lead nitrate removes the elements of hydrogen sulphide to produce phenyl 
isothiocyanate. As indicated in the preparation of p-bromophenyl isothiocya- 
nate which is given as a further example, a slightly modified procedure which 
requires the use of rectified spirit as a reaction solvent is necessary in order to 
obtain good yields of isothiocyanates from substituted anilines.

Method 2 

Ph-NH 3 }C1 + NH 2 -CONH 2 »• Ph-NH-CONH 2 + NH 4 C1 

Method 1. Dissolve 9.3 g (9.1ml, 0.1 mol) of aniline in 10ml of glacial 
acetic acid diluted to 100 ml contained in a 250-ml beaker or conical flask, 
and add with stirring or shaking a solution of 6.5 g (0.1 mol) of sodium 
cyanate in 50 ml of warm water. Allow to stand for 30 minutes, then cool in 
ice, and allow to stand for a further 30 minutes. Filter at the pump, wash with 
water and dry at 100 °C. The resulting phenylurea is generally colourless and 
has a m.p. of 148 °C (i.e. is pure): the yield is 11 g (81%). If the colour or the 
m.p. of the product is not quite satisfactory, recrystallise it from boiling water 
(10 ml per gram) with the aid of decolourising charcoal. 

Method 2. Dissolve 65 g (0.5 mol) of aniline hydrochloride and 120g (2 mol) 
of urea in 200 ml of water contained in a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask; filter 
the solution, if necessary. Add 4 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 
4 ml of glacial acetic acid. Fit a reflux condenser to the flask, introduce a few 
fragments of broken porcelain and boil the mixture for 30 minutes. Fine white 
crystals (largely sym.-diphenylurea) appear after about 15 minutes and 
gradually increase in amount as the refluxing is continued. Cool the flask in 
ice and filter with suction. Separate the mixture of phenylurea and 
diphenylurea (c. 42 g) by boiling with 500ml of water and filter at the pump 
through a preheated Buchner funnel into a warm flask; cool the filtrate, 
collect the phenylurea, drain well and dry in the steam oven. The phenylurea 
melts at 146-147 °C and weighs 30 g (44%); recrystallisation from hot water 
raises the m.p. to 148 °C. The crude diphenylurea (residue from first 
recrystallisation after drying at 100 °C) has m.p. 241 °C and weighs 10 g 
(19%); recrystallisation from glacial acetic acid or ethyl acetate with the addi- 
tion of a little decolourising carbon gives a colourless product, m.p. 242 °C. 

Cognate preparations. p-Tolylurea (Method 1). Dissolve 10.7 g (0.1 mol) of p- 
toluidine in a warm mixture of 10 ml of glacial acetic acid and 50 ml of water, 
and then dilute with 150 ml of hot water. Introduce, with stirring or shaking, 
a solution of 6.5 g (0.1 mol) of sodium cyanate in 50 ml of hot water. The p- 
tolylurea precipitates almost immediately. Allow to stand several hours, filter 
at the pump, wash with water and dry. The yield of p-tolylurea, m.p. 180- 
180.5 °C, is 14 g (85%). Recrystallise from aqueous ethanol; the resulting p- 
tolylurea melts sharply at 181 °C. 

p-Bromophenylurea. Proceed as for p-tolylurea (Method 1), but use 17.2g 
(0.1 mol) of p-bromoaniline dissolved in a mixture of 50 ml of glacial acetic 
acid and 100 ml of water at 35 °C; add gradually a solution of 6.5 g (0. 1 mol) of 
sodium cyanate in 50 ml of water at 35 °C. The yield of crude p- 
bromophenylurea is 19 g (88%); m.p. 227 °C. Recrystallise from 90 per cent 
aqueous ethanol; m.p. 228 °C. The m.p. depends somewhat upon the rate of 
heating. 

p-Methoxyphenylurea. Proceed as for phenylurea, Method 2, but use 79 g 
(0.5 mol) of p-anisidine hydrochloride in place of 65 g of aniline hydro- 
chloride; reflux the mixture for 1 hour. Cool the reaction mixture slowly to °C, 
filter and recrystallise from boiling water. The yield of p-methoxyphenylurea, 
m.p. 168 °C, is 60 g (72%).

6.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



p-Ethoxyphenylurea. Proceed as for phenylurea, Method 2, but use 87 g 
(0.5 mol) of p-phenetidine hydrochloride; reflux the mixture for 45-90 
minutes. The product commences to separate after 20-30 minutes and 
increases rapidly until the entire contents of the flask suddenly set to a solid 
mass: withdraw the source of heat immediately at this point. Cool to room 
temperature, add 1 50 ml of water, stir, filter with suction and wash with cold 
water. Suspend the solid in 2 litres of boiling water, add 1 g of decolourising 
carbon, boil for 5 minutes and filter through a hot water funnel; cool the 
colourless filtrate slowly to °C, collect the solid which separates and dry at 
100 °C. The yield of p-ethoxyphenylurea, m.p. 174 °C, is 60g (67%). 

Experiment 6.97 THIOCARBANILIDE (sym.-Diphenylthiourea) 

2Ph-NH 2 + CS 2 -^±&gt; S=C(NH-Ph) 2 + H 2 S 

In a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask provided with an efficient double surface 
condenser, place 40 g (39 ml, 0.43 mol) of aniline, 50 g (40 ml, 0.66 mol) of 
carbon disulphide (CAUTION: flammable) (1) and 50g (63.5 ml) of absolute 
ethanol (2). Set up the apparatus in the fume cupboard or attach an 
absorption device to the top of the condenser (see Fig. 2.61) to absorb the 
hydrogen sulphide which is evolved. Heat upon an electrically heated water 
bath or upon a steam bath for 8 hours or until the contents of the flask 
solidify. When the reaction is complete, arrange the condenser for downward 
distillation and remove the excess of carbon disulphide and alcohol 
(CAUTION: flammable; there must be no flame near the receiver). Shake the 
residue in the flask with excess of dilute hydrochloric acid (1:10) to remove 
any aniline present, filter at the pump, wash with water and drain well. Dry in 
the steam oven. The yield of crude product, which is quite satisfactory for the 
preparation of phenyl isothiocyanate (Expt 6.98), is 40-45 g (81-91%). 
Recrystallise the crude thiocarbanilide by dissolving it, under reflux, in 
boiling rectified spirit (filter through a hot water funnel if the solution is not 
clear), and add hot water until the solution just becomes cloudy and allow to 
cool. Pure sym.-diphenylthiourea separates in colourless needles, m.p. 154 °C. 

Notes. (1) No flames may be present in the vicinity: read Section 2.3.2, p. 39. 
(2) The addition of powdered potassium hydroxide (about 20 per cent of the weight of 
the carbon disulphide) reduces the refluxing period necessary to complete the 
reaction.

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.S 



condenser and reflux gently in the fume cupboard for 30 minutes. Distil the 
mixture until the oily phenyl isothiocyanate has all passed over; the volume 
remaining in the flask will be 25-30 ml. Crystals of triphenylguanidine 
hydrochloride may appear in the distilling flask during the latter part of the 
distillation. Dilute the distillate with an equal volume of water, and extract 
the isocyanate with ether; wash the extract with a little sodium carbonate 
solution, and dry over anhydrous calcium chloride or magnesium sulphate. 
Remove the ether on a rotary evaporator and distil the residual oil, collecting 
the phenyl isothiocyanate at 217-220 °C (1). The yield is lOg (67.5%). 

To isolate the triphenylguanidine formed as a by-product dilute the residue 
in the flask with 50 ml of water, add 2-3 g of decolourising carbon, warm and 
filter. Cool the solution in ice, and filter off the hydrochloride at the pump. 
Dissolve it in the minimum volume of hot water, render the solution alkaline 
with sodium hydroxide and allow to cool. Filter off the free base (triphenyl- 
guanidine), and recrystallise it from ethanol; it separates in colourless 
crystals, m.p. 144 °C. The yield is 3 g. 

Note. (1) It may also be distilled under diminished pressure, b.p. 95 °C/12mmHg. 

Method 2. Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a powerful mechanical 
stirrer and a separatory funnel; leave the third neck open or loosely 
stoppered. Introduce, while the flask is cooled in a freezing mixture of ice and 
salt, 90 ml of concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.88) and 54 g (43 ml, 
0.71 mol) of pure carbon disulphide (1). Stir the mixture and run in 56 g 
(55 ml, 0.60 mol) of aniline from the separatory funnel during about 20 
minutes; stir for a further 30 minutes, and allow to stand for another 30 
minutes. A heavy precipitate of ammonium phenyldithiocarbamate sep- 
arates. Transfer the salt to a 5-litre round-bottomed flask by four extractions 
with 200 ml portions of water. Add to the resulting solution, with constant 
stirring, a solution of 200 g (0.605 mol) of lead nitrate in 400 ml of water; lead 
sulphide precipitates. Steam distil the mixture into a receiver containing 
10ml of c. 0.5 m sulphuric acid as long as organic material passes over (2-3 
litres of distillate). Separate the oil, dry it over anhydrous calcium chloride or 
magnesium sulphate and distil under diminished pressure. Collect the phenyl 
isothiocyanate at 120-121°C/35mmHg or at 95 °C (12mmHg). The yield is 
62 g (76%). 

Note. (1) CAUTION, see Expt 6.97. 

Cognate preparation. p-Bromophenyl isothiocyanate (Method 2). Add 41 ml 
of concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.88) slowly with stirring to a solution 
of 45 g (0.26 mol) of p-bromoaniline (Expt 6.67), 30 g (24 ml, 0.396 mol) of 
carbon disulphide and 40 ml of rectified spirit at 10-15 °C. Considerable heat 
is evolved; cool the flask in a freezing mixture from time to time so that the 
temperature does not rise above 30 °C. The original milky suspension 
becomes clear and the intermediate dithiocarbamate soon crystallises out. 
Allow to stand overnight, filter the crystals, wash with a little ether, dissolve 
in 1 500 ml of water and stir mechanically while a solution of 87 g (0.262 mol) 
of lead nitrate in 175 ml of water is slowly added. Continue the stirring for 20 
minutes, and isolate the p-bromophenyl isothiocyanate by steam distillation 
into a receiver containing 5 ml of c. 0.5 m sulphuric acid; if the substance 
solidifies in the condenser, stop the cooling water until the solid has melted

and run into the receiver. Filter the cold solid product, wash with a little 
water and dry in the air upon filter paper. The yield is 15 g (50%), m.p. 61 °C.

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

Phenols, wherein the hydroxyl group is directly attached to the aromatic 
nucleus, exhibit in their i.r. absorption spectra strong absorption (3400- 
3600 cm" ! ) arising from the O — H stretching vibrations. A full discussion of this 
and other characteristic absorptions due to the C — O stretching and the O — H 
bending vibrations, and the assignment of the substitution pattern from the 
absorption in the longer wavelength region is given on p. 286. The important 
feature of hydrogen bonding (intra- and inter-molecular) must be noted, tri- 
cresol being an illustrative example (Fig. 3.22). The absorption frequency of the 
low field signal of the oxygen-bound proton in the p.m.r. spectrum of a phenol 
depends on the extent of hydrogen bonding, but it may be distinguished from 
other low-field signals since the absorption disappears after appropriate 
treatment of the sample with deuterium oxide (p. 348). Aromatic substitution 
patterns are confirmed by inspection of the appropriate region of the p.m.r. 
spectrum. Further descriptive accounts of structural assignments are to be found 
in the preparative examples below which also include an analysis of the 
important fragmentation patterns observed in the m.s. (see also p. 375). The 
presence of a hydroxyl group in an aromatic nucleus results in a bathochromic 
shift of the absorption of the aromatic system in the u.v. -visible; this shift 
becomes enhanced when a nitro group is also present p. 392). 

Concerning phenyl ethers, the i.r. spectrum of anisole (Fig. 3.25), its p.m.r. 
spectrum (Fig. 3.46) and l3 C-n.m.r. spectrum (Fig. 3.54) are discussed on pp. 
325, and 337 respectively. Further illustrative analyses are included in some of 
the preparative examples below which also include a discussion of relevant m.s.

6.9.1 METHODS FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A HYDROXYL GROUP INTO AN AROMATIC 
RING 

REPLACEMENT OF A SULPHONIC ACID GROUP 

A fairly general procedure, which has also been used on the industrial scale, 
involves heating the alkali metal sulphonate with either sodium or potassium 
hydroxide in the presence of a small amount of water to aid the fusion process. 
The reaction mechanism may be formulated as a bimolecular nucleophilic 
addition-elimination sequence.

The reaction is illustrated by the synthesis of 2-naphthol (Expt 6.99). 

Occasionally in the synthesis of phenols by this route oxidation products are 
formed. A particular example is provided by the alkali fusion of sodium 
anthraquinone-2-sulphonate during which a second hydroxyl group is intro- 
duced into the 1 -position, forming the dyestuff alizarin (1) (cognate preparation 
in Expt 6.99). In the procedure described the oxidation step is promoted by the 
deliberate introduction of potassium chlorate as an oxidant. 




OH 



REPLACEMENT OF A HALOGEN 

Direct nucleophilic displacement of the halogen in an aryl halide is difficult and 
hydrolysis to phenols requires high temperatures and pressures; the method is 
therefore only suitable on the large scale. The presence of a nitro group in the 
ortho or para position, however, makes the halogen more labile since electron 
withdrawal by the nitro group in these positions stabilises the intermediate 
anion by electron delocalisation. p-Chloronitrobenzene, for example, is hydro- 
lysed to p-nitrophenol when heated with 15 per cent sodium hydroxide solution 
at about 150 °C.

When two activating nitro groups are present hydrolysis takes place readily 
with dilute aqueous alkali solution (e.g. 2,4-dinitrophenol, Expt 6.100). 

Aryl halides of many different types, including simple unsubstituted halides, 
may be conveniently converted into phenols by an indirect route involving the 
preparation of an arylboronic acid and its subsequent oxidation with hydrogen 
peroxide. The arylboronic acid (3) is normally prepared by reaction of the 
corresponding arylmagnesium halide with a borate ester (typically tributyl 
borate) at between —60 and — 80 °C, to yield the dialkyl boronate ester (2) 
which is then hydrolysed to the arylboronic acid (3). The latter may be isolated, 
purified and then oxidised with hydrogen peroxide as described in the 
preparation of m-cresol (Expt 6.101). Alternatively the crude reaction mixture 
from the preparation of (3) may be treated directly with hydrogen peroxide. 36

REPLACEMENT OF A DIAZO GROUP 

The preparation of phenols by the hydrolysis of diazonium salts with hot 
aqueous acid, and by a recent milder procedure suitable for diazonium salts 
having additional acid-sensitive groups, is discussed in Section 6.7.1, p. 922, and 
illustrated in Expt 6.69. Although these methods enable an aromatic hydrocar- 
bon system to be converted in good yield into a phenol via the corresponding 
nitro and amino derivatives, the shorter route involving the alkaline fusion of 
the sulphonic acid discussed above may often be preferred.

6.9 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Support a 250-ml nickel, copper (better silver-plated copper) or iron 
crucible or beaker in a large circular hole in a sheet of heat resistant board 
resting on a tripod. Prepare a case of nickel or copper to surround a 360 °C 
thermometer for about two-thirds of its length; this may be done either by 
cutting a suitable length of nickel or copper tubing already closed at one end, 
or by hammering down the end of the open tube and folding over the flat part 
in a vice. Fit a large cork around the top of the tube; this will serve for 
handling the tube containing the thermometer when it is subsequently used 
for stirring the molten alkali. Since some splattering of the latter cannot 
generally be avoided, goggles, gloves and a well-fitting laboratory coat must 
be worn. 

Place 120g (2.15 mol) of potassium hydroxide sticks or pellets (1) together 
with 5 ml of water in the crucible, and heat with a Bunsen burner until it 
melts. When the temperature reaches about 250 °C, remove the flame, and 
quickly add with stirring 50 g (0.22 mol) of finely powdered sodium 
naphthalene-2-sulphonate (Expt 6.38). Replace the flame, stir the stiff pasty 
mass and continue the heating so that the temperature rises to 300 °C in 5-10 
minutes. Stir the mixture continuously; there is some frothing at first and 
at about 300 °C the mass suddenly becomes a clear, mobile, brown oil of the 
potassium salt of 2-naphthol floating on a pasty mass of alkali. Raise the 
temperature during 5 minutes to 310 °C, remove the flame, push down 
the material from the side of the crucible and reheat to 310 °C for about 2 
minutes, and then allow the melt to cool. Do not permit the melt to solidify 
completely. When it becomes pasty, ladle it out in small portions (with a 
nickel spatula, 'spoon' end) into a 1 -litre beaker half-filled with crushed ice. 
Extract the residual material in the crucible with water and add it to the 
contents of the beaker. Precipitate the 2-naphthol by adding concentrated 
hydrochloric acid slowly and with stirring (fume cupboard: S0 2 ); if the 2- 
naphthol separates in a finely divided form, warm until the particles 
coagulate. Cool in ice, filter at the pump and transfer the precipitate to a 
beaker containing cold water. Add just sufficient 5 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution to dissolve the solid and also 1 g of sodium dithionite (Na 2 S 2 4 ) to 
prevent oxidation, and filter from traces of insoluble matter. Precipitate the 2- 
naphthol with acetic acid, warm to produce a more readily filterable form of 
the precipitate, cool in ice and filter the product. Dry in the air upon filter 
paper. The yield is 25 g (80%), m.p. 122 °C. If the m.p. is unsatisfactory, 
recrystallise from water, dilute ethanol or carbon tetrachloride. 

Note. (1) Sodium hydroxide may replace potassium hydroxide in this preparation; 
1 50 g together with 1 5 ml of water are required. The sulphonate is stirred in when the 
temperature reaches 280 °C and the reaction is complete at 3 10-320 °C. 

Cognate preparation. Alizarin. Dissolve successively in 75 ml of water 6g 
(0.049 mol) of potassium chlorate, 20 g (0.065 mol) of sodium anthraquinone- 
2-sulphonate (Expt 6.39) and 75 g of sodium hydroxide. Transfer the mixture 
to a 500-ml autoclave (compare Section 2.17.2, p. 97) and heat for 20 hours 
at 170°C. After cooling, scrape out the violet-coloured mass and extract it 
three or four times with 100 ml portions of boiling water. Acidify the filtered 
extract with hydrochloric acid. When cold, filter the orange precipitate of 
alizarin at the pump, wash it thoroughly with cold water and dry at 100 °C. 
The yield of alizarin is 14 g (90%). It may be purified by recrystallisation

the mixture for 24 hours or until the oil passes into solution. Acidify the

recrystallise from ethanol or from water. 

The p.m.r. spectrum (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) provides an excellent example for 
the assignment of absorptions to specific hydrogens from the correlation of 
coupling constants; the signals appear at S 7.29 (d, 1H, C 6 — H), 8.30 (d of d,

in-Tolyboronic acid. Equip a thoroughly dried 1 -litre flange flask with a low 
temperature reading thermometer, and an efficient sealed stirrer unit, and 
attach a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser both protected with calcium 
chloride guard-tubes. Mount the flask in a Cardice-acetone cooling bath and 
add to the flask 40.5 g (0.17) of pure tributyl borate (1) dissolved in 150 ml of 
ether (previously dried over sodium wire). Then, with fairly rapid stirring, 
add slowly from the dropping funnel a solution of m-tolylmagnesium 
bromide [0.175 mol; (2)] in 450 ml of dry ether. It is essential that the rate of 
addition throughout the reaction should be such that the temperature of the 
reaction mixture is kept between —70 and —75 °C. As the ethereal solution 
of the Grignard reagent is added, a white precipitate is formed immediately 
and slowly dissolves; when all of the reagent has been added (about 3 hours), 
continue to stir the mixture at —75 °C for a further 2 hours. With continued 
stirring, allow the reddish-orange solution to warm slowly to 0°C, remove 
the dropping funnel, condenser and stirrer, stopper the flask and place it in a 
refrigerator to attain a temperature of about 5 °C over a period of 12 hours. 
Slowly add the cold reaction mixture with efficient stirring to 120 ml of chilled 
(0-5 °C) 10 per cent sulphuric acid. Transfer the resultant mixture to a 
separating funnel, separate the layers and thoroughly extract the aqueous 
phase with four 100 ml portions of ether. Concentrate the combined ether

To the residual m-tolylboronic acid in butan-1-ol add 50 ml of water,

stages, solid material often separates but this should not be filtered off. 
Render the residual solution acid to litmus by adding dilute aqueous 
sulphuric acid and, if necessary, make up the volume to 60 ml by the addition 
of distilled water. Without separating the precipitated solid, heat the mixture 
to boiling when the precipitate dissolves and a heavy dark brown oil appears. 
Decant the hot supernatant solution through a fluted filter paper and extract 
the oil with four 40 ml portions of boiling water. Combine the hot filtered

efficient stirrer and a dropping funnel, place 5.4 g (0.040 mol) of m- 
tolylboronic acid and 100 ml of ether. While stirring the slurry add 30 ml of 10 
per cent hydrogen peroxide solution from the dropping funnel over a period 
of about 5 minutes. The two-phase system in the flask becomes warm as the 
reaction proceeds. When all the hydrogen peroxide has been added, continue 
stirring until the contents of the flask have cooled to room temperature (20- 
30 minutes) and then transfer to a separating funnel. Run off and discard the 
aqueous layer and wash the ether layer thoroughly with three 30 ml portions 
of 10 per cent iron(n) ammonium sulphate solution to remove remaining 
traces of hydrogen peroxide. Extract the product from the ether layer by 
shaking with three 30 ml portions of 10 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide 
solution. Acidify the combined alkaline extracts with concentrated hydroch- 
loric acid and extract the product with three 70 ml portions of ether. Dry the 
combined ether extracts with calcium sulphate, filter and evaporate on a 
rotary evaporator. Distil the crude product and collect the m-cresol at 198- 
202 °C. The yield is 2.5 g (58%). 

The i.r. spectrum of m-cresol is given on p. 288. The substitution pattern is 
confirmed from the absorptions in the 600-800 cm " ' [the ortho isomer shows 
one band at c. 750 cm" 1 (5 adj. H's); the para isomer shows absorption at c. 
815cm" 1 (2 adj. H's)]. In the p.m.r. spectra (CDC1 3 , TMS) of the three 
isomers the substitution pattern is only clearly defined in the case of the para 
isomer which shows 3 2.20 (s, 3H, Me), 6.45 (broad s, 1H, OH), 6.69 (d, 2H, 
ortho-H's to OH), and 6.92 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to Me). The meta and ortho 
isomers both show complex multiplets in the 3 6.3-7.20 region. The m.s. of all 
three isomers are very similar having significant fragment ions at m/z 108 (M, 
base peak), 107 (M - H), 79 (107 - CO), 77 (79 - H 2 ), and 51 (77 - C 2 H 2 ). 

Notes. (1) The tributyl borate is available commercially (Aldrich) and packaged in 
Sure/Seal™ bottles under nitrogen. 

(2) The ethereal solution of m-tolylmagnesium bromide may be prepared by using 20 g 
(0. 1 75 mol) of m-bromotoluene, 4.2 g (0. 1 75 mol) of magnesium turnings and 450 ml of 
dry ether (cf. Expt 5.39). When nearly all the magnesium has reacted the solution 
should be quickly decanted into a dry dropping funnel and addition to the cooled 
tributyl borate solution begun immediately. 

(3) It is not possible to obtain an analytically pure sample of arylboronic acids since, 
on drying, partial conversion to the trimeric anhydride occurs. A quantitative 
conversion to the anhydride is achieved in the case of m-tolylboronic acid by heating 
with forty times its weight of benzene in a flask fitted with a Dean and Stark water 
separator (Fig. 2.31(a)). When no further water droplets separate the benzene solution

is concentrated to one-quarter volume and cooled. m-Tolylboronic anhydride 
crystallises out and has m.p. 161-162 °C. The anhydride may be reconverted to the 
acid by dissolving it in the minimum quantity of hot water and allowing the solution 
to cool, whereupon the acid crystallises. 

6.9.2 SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS OF PHENOLS 

The phenolic group is activating and ortho-para directing. The electrophilic 
substitution reactions in the nucleus in: (a) nitrosation and nitration; (b) 
halogenation and; (c) acylation and alkylation, are therefore particularly facile, 
and various experimental procedures need to be adopted to control the extent of 
substitution (cf. substitution reactions of aromatic amines and their acylated 
derivatives, Sections 6.6.1 and 6.6.2, pp. 906 and 916 respectively). 

NITROSATION AND NITRATION 

Phenol may be converted into a mixture of o- and p-nitrophenols (Expt 6.102) 
by reaction with dilute nitric acid; the yield of p-nitrophenol is increased if a 
mixture of sodium nitrate and dilute sulphuric acid is employed. Upon steam 
distillation of the mixture of nitrophenols, the ortho isomer passes over in a 
substantially pure form; the para isomer remains in the distillation flask, and can 
be readily isolated by extraction with hot 2 per cent hydrochloric acid. The 
mechanism of the substitution probably involves an electrophilic attack (cf. 
Section 6.2.1, p. 851) by a nitrosonium ion at a position either ortho or para to 
the activating hydroxyl group, to yield a mixture of o- and p-nitrosophenols, 
which are then oxidised by the nitric acid to the corresponding nitrophenols. 
The reaction depends upon the presence in the nitric acid of traces of nitrous 
acid which serve as the source of the nitrosonium ion.

N=0

If the phenol is allowed to react with nitrous acid (generated in an acidified 
solution of sodium nitrite), the nitrosophenol may be obtained in good yield. An 
example is provided by the nitrosation of 2-naphthol which yields l-nitroso-2- 
naphthol (Expt 6.103). 

By suitably introducing sulphonic acid 'blocking groups', which may 
subsequently be removed by heating under aqueous acidic conditions, control 
over the orientation of other substituents introduced into the aromatic nucleus 
of a phenol may be achieved. The procedure is illustrated by the synthesis of 2- 
nitroresorcinol (Expt 6.104). In this reaction disulphonation of the dihydric 
phenol can readily be achieved, the sulphonic acid groups taking up the 4- and 
6-positions. When the disulphonic acid is then nitrated the nitro group enters 
the remaining active site, i.e. the 2-position, removal of the sulphonic acid 
residues then yields the required 2-nitroresorcinol. In this sequence it is essential 
that the experimental conditions for the nitration step are as mild as possible (i.e. 
below 20 °C), since more vigorous conditions may result in electrophilic 
replacement of a sulphonic acid group by a nitro group. This is apparent in the 

975 



S.9 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



classical synthesis of 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (picric acid). Thus phenol is first 
sulphonated to yield a mixture of o- and p-phenolsulphonic acids; nitration of 
this product with a hot mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated 
sulphuric acid results in the introduction of a nitro group into all the ortho and 
para activated positions with displacement of the sulphonic acid group. The 
direct nitration of phenol to the trinitro derivative in good yield is not possible 
since much of the starting material is oxidatively destroyed.

HALOGENATION 

When treated with bromine water an aqueous solution of phenol gives an 
immediate precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromophenol (Section 9.6.6, p. 1251), owing to 
the powerfully activating influence of the negatively charged oxygen in the 
phenoxide ion. 




The monobromination of phenol can, however, be achieved by using 
solutions of bromine in non-polar solvents such as carbon disulphide and 
carbon tetrachloride at low temperature (0-5 °C). The product is almost 
exclusively the para isomer (Expt 6.105). 

o-Bromophenol is conveniently prepared by first sulphonating phenol with 
excess of concentrated sulphuric acid to yield phenol-2,4-disulphonic acid, 
neutralising with sodium hydroxide, heating the solution of the sodium salt with 
1 mol of bromine and then removing the sulphonic acid groups by treatment 
with aqueous sulphuric acid at 200 °C. The sequence is described and 
formulated in Expt 6.106. 

ACYLATION AND ALKYLATION 

The various methods for introducing a formyl group ( — CO-H) into a phenolic 
nucleus are discussed in Section 6.10.1, p. 990. The formation of phenolic 
ketones (e.g. HO-C 6 H 4 -COR) by the standard Friedel-Crafts acylation 
procedure (i.e. the reaction of a phenol with an acid chloride in the presence of 
aluminium chloride) does not always give acceptable yields except in the case of 
polyhydroxyphenols (p. 1006). The preferred method is to convert the phenol into 
the phenyl ester and to subject this to rearrangement (the Fries reaction) in the 
presence of aluminium chloride.

Experimental procedures are given in Expt 6.107 for o- and p-hydroxy- 
propiophenones (R = Et). The ortho-para ratio in the product is influenced by 
the nature of the alkyl residue, the temperature, the solvent and the amount of 
aluminium chloride used: generally low temperatures favour the formation of p- 
hydroxyketones. It is usually possible to separate the two hydroxyketones by 
fractional distillation under reduced pressure through an efficient fractionating 
column or by steam distillation; the ortho isomers, being chelated, are more 
steam volatile. It may be mentioned that Clemmensen reduction (cf. Sections 
5.1.3, p. 476 and 6.1.1, p. 826) of the hydroxyketones affords an excellent route to 
alkyl phenols.

2,5-Dihydroxyacetophenone (6) (cognate preparation in Expt 6.107), which 
cannot be prepared by a Friedel-Crafts acetylation of hydroquinone, is 
obtained in good yield when hydroquinone diacetate (5) is heated in the 
presence of 3.3 mol of aluminium chloride.

When phenol is treated with allyl bromide in the presence of potassium 
carbonate and acetone, the product is almost entirely allyl phenyl ether (Expt 
6.110). This undergoes ready thermal rearrangement to give 2-allylphenol 
(Expt 6.108), which is an example of the Claisen rearrangement. The mechanism 
of this intramolecular rearrangement involves a cyclic transition state (8) as 
formulated below, and is designated as a [3,3] sigmatropic shift; the numbers 
give the location of the atoms which are joined by the new ff-bond relative to the 
bond undergoing fission. 

A protropic shift may be induced to effect double bond migration in the side 
chain by heating the allyl phenyl ether with methanolic potassium hydroxide 
when 2-(prop-l-enyl) phenol is formed (Expt 6.108).

(CAUTION) 37 with 20ml of water, and add this dropwise from a separatory 
funnel to the vigorously stirred mixture in the flask; maintain the tempera-

phenol has been added. Pour off the mother-liquor from the resinous mixture 
of nitro compounds. Melt the residue with 500 ml of water, shake and allow 
the contents of the flask to settle. Pour off the wash liquor and repeat the 
washing at least two or three times to ensure the complete removal of any 
residual acid. Steam distil the mixture (Fig. 2.102) until no more o-

off the cooling water temporarily. Collect the distillate in cold water, filter at 
the pump and drain thoroughly. Dry upon filter paper in the air. The yield of 
o-nitrophenol, m.p. 46 °C (1), is 50g (36%). 

Allow the residue in the flask to cool during 2 hours and then cool in ice 
for 1 5-30 minutes. Filter off the crude p-nitrophenol and boil it with 1 litre of 
2 per cent hydrochloric acid (2) together with about 5 g of decolourising 
charcoal for at least 10 minutes. Filter through a hot water funnel (or 
through a preheated Buchner funnel): allow the filtrate to crystallise 
overnight. Filter off the almost colourless needles and dry them upon filter 
paper. The yield of p-nitrophenol, m.p. 112°C, is 35 g (25%). Further small 
quantities may be obtained by concentrating the mother-liquor and also by 
repeating the extraction of the residue with 2 per cent hydrochloric acid. 

The p.m.r. spectra of the two isomers confirm their substitution 
patterns. In the case of p-nitrophenol (Me 2 CO, TMS) signals are observed at 
8 7.06 (d, 2H, ortho-YVs to OH), 8.15 (d, 2H, ortho-Ws to N0 2 ) and 9.32 
(broad s, 1H, OH); with o-nitrophenol the four dissimilar aromatic protons 
give rise to complex coupling leading to signals at 3 6.8-7.2 (m, 2H, C 5 6 — H), 
7.51 (m, 1H, C 4 — H), 8.00 (d of d, 1H, C 3 — H), and 10.46 (s, 1H, OH). 

Notes. (1) If the m.p. is not quite satisfactory, dissolve the o-nitrophenol in hot 
ethanol (or industrial spirit) under reflux, add hot water drop by drop until a 
cloudiness just appears and allow to cool spontaneously. Filter off the bright yellow 
crystals and dry between filter paper. 

(2) It is not advisable to treat the crude p-nitrophenol with sodium hydroxide solution 
in order to convert it into the sodium derivative: alkali causes extensive resinification.

the l-nitroso-2-naphthol, m.p. 97 °C, weighs 130g. It contains about 10 per

dropping funnel a cooled mixture of 4 ml of concentrated nitric acid (72%) 
and 5.6 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. It is essential that the temperature 
of the reaction mixture should not be allowed to exceed 20 °C. When the 
addition is complete, allow the mixture to stand for a further 1 5 minutes, and 
then cautiously add 15 g of crushed ice. External cooling may be also 
necessary to keep the temperature below 20 °C. 

Transfer the resulting yellow-brown solution to a 250-ml round-bottomed

CAUTION: This preparation should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 
Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a reflux condenser, a mechanical

chloride guard-tube leading by means of a glass tube to a funnel just 
immersed in a beaker holding about 150 ml of water for absorption of 
hydrogen bromide (compare Fig. 2.61(a)) (1). Place 94g (1 mol) of phenol 
dissolved in 100 ml of dry carbon disulphide (CAUTION: flammable) in the

When the temperature falls below 5 °C, add slowly (during about 2 hours) 
from the separatory funnel a solution of 160g (51ml, 1 mol) of bromine 
(CAUTION) in 50 ml of carbon disulphide. Then arrange the flask for 
distillation under reduced pressure by inserting a Claisen still-head which 
incorporates a short fractionating side-arm (compare Fig. 2.108) into the 
central socket of the three-necked flask; stopper the remaining sockets. 
Connect a condenser set for downward distillation to the still-head and

attach the device for absorbing the hydrogen bromide evolved to the side- 
arm of the receiver adapter. Distil off the carbon disulphide at atmospheric 
pressure on a water bath held at 60 °C. (CAUTION: very low flash point, see 
Section 2.3.2, p. 40.) Remove the absorption device, insert a capillary leak 
and a thermometer into the Claisen still-head sockets and continue 
distillation under reduced pressure (oil bath). Collect two fractions: (a) b.p. 
below 145°C/25-30mmHg which is an inseparable mixture of o- and p- 
bromophenols (24-33 g), and; (b) b.p. 145-150 °C/25-30mmHg, which is 
fairly pure p-bromophenol. The residue in the flask contains some higher 
boiling 2,4-dibromophenol. The p-bromophenol solidifies on cooling to a 
solid white mass, which usually contains traces of an oil; this may be removed 
by spreading on a porous tile or by centrifuging. The dry crystals have m.p. 
63 °C; the yield is 140-145 g (81-84%). 

The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) is characteristic of para substitution 
showing signals at 5 5.20 (s, 1H, OH), 6.69 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to OH), and 7.30

(CAUTION) and 1 16 g (63 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid, and heat in a 
boiling water bath for 3 hours with mechanical stirring. Cool to room 
temperature or below by immersing the flask in ice-water, and then add 
slowly a solution of 95 g of sodium hydroxide in 235 ml of water: a solid salt 
may separate, but this will dissolve at a later stage. Replace the separatory 
funnel by a thermometer, which dips well into the liquid, and support a small 
dropping funnel over the top of the condenser. Cool the alkaline solution to 
room temperature, and add 53 g (17 ml) of bromine (CAUTION) from the 
dropping funnel down the condenser during 20-30 minutes while stirring 
constantly; permit the temperature to rise to 40-50 °C. Continue the stirring 
for 30 minutes after the bromine has been introduced: the reaction mixture 
should still be alkaline and contain only a small amount of suspended matter. 
The solution must now be evaporated. Arrange the flask assembly so that a 
rapid stream of air can be passed through the stirred reaction mixture, i.e. 
replace the thermometer by a wide air leak, connect the condenser for 
downward distillation using a knee bend and fit a receiver adapter with the

take-off arm connected to the water pump. Heat the flask in an oil bath at 
150-155 °C while maintaining a brisk current of air until a thick pasty mass 
remains (30-40 minutes). Allow to cool and then add 270 ml of concentrated 
sulphuric acid (fume cupboard: much hydrogen bromide is evolved). Heat the 
flask in an oil bath at 195-205 °C and pass a current of steam into the mixture 
(compare Fig. 2.102); this results in the hydrolysis of the sulphonate groups 
and the bromophenol distils over as a heavy, colourless (or pale yellow) oil. 
When the distillate is clear, extract it with ether. Dry the ethereal extract with 
a little magnesium sulphate, remove the ether on a water bath (Fig. 2.101) 
and distil the residue as rapidly as possible since the bromophenol is 
somewhat unstable and decomposes appreciably at the high temperature. 
Collect the fraction, b.p. 195-200 °C (a colourless liquid with a characteristic 
odour), which is practically pure o-bromophenol. The yield is 25 g (43%). The 
compound is somewhat unstable and decomposes on standing, becoming

Equip a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a dropping funnel, a sturdy

187g (1.4 mol) of anhydrous aluminium chloride and 200 ml of carbon 
disulphide in it (CAUTION: see Section 2.3.2, p. 40); attach a gas absorption 
trap (Fig. 2.61) to the top of the condenser. Stir the suspension and add 188g 
(179 ml, 1.25 mol) of phenyl propanoate (Expt 5.149) slowly and at such a 
rate that the solvent boils vigorously (about 90 minutes). Much hydrogen 
chloride is evolved and is absorbed by the trap. When all the phenyl 
propanoate has been introduced, gently reflux the reaction mixture on a 
water bath until the evolution of hydrogen chloride ceases (about 2 hours). 
Turn the reflux condenser downwards (compare Fig. 2.98), and distil off the 
solvent from the water bath (CAUTION: carbon disulphide). Then replace 
the latter by an oil bath maintained at 140-150 °C and heat, with stirring, for 
3 hours. During this period more hydrogen chloride is evolved, the mixture 
thickens and finally becomes a brown resinous mass; continue the stirring as 
long as possible. Allow the reaction mixture to cool and decompose the 
aluminium chloride complex by slowly adding first 1 50 ml of dilute hydro- 
chloric acid (1 : 1) and then 250 ml of water; much heat is evolved and a dark oil 
collects on the surface. Allow to stand overnight, when most of the p- 
hydroxypropiophenone in the upper layer solidifies. Filter this off at the 
pump, and recrystallise it from 200 ml of methanol; 74 g (39%) of p-

Remove the methanol from the mother-liquors using a rotary evaporator 
and combine the residue with that obtained by extracting the original filtrate

quantity (20 g, 11%) of crude p-hydroxypropiophenone at 140-

Record the i.r. spectrum of each isomer and note the absorptions due to 
the OH and CO stretching vibrations (in particular the effect of hydrogen 
bonding in the case of the ortho isomer). Each spectrum shows absorptions in 
the 700-800 cm" 1 region which confirms the respective state of substitution. 
The p.m.r. spectra are easily differentiated; the ortho isomer (CDC1 3 , TMS) 
has signals at 8 1.19 (t, 3H, Me), 2.93 (q, 2H, CH 2 ), 6.60-7.75 (m, 5H, C AR — 
H), and 12.13 (s, 1H, OH); the para isomer (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) has signals at 3 
1.10 (t, 3H, Me), 2.92 (q, 2H, CH 2 ), 6.90 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to COEt) and 7.88 
(d, 2H, ortho-H's to OH). In the latter case the hydroxyl proton is not 
observed. 

Cognate preparation. 2,5-Dihydroxyacetophenone. Finely powder a mixture 
of 40g (0.2 mol) of dry hydroquinone diacetate (1) and 87 g (0.65 mol) of 
anhydrous aluminium chloride in a glass mortar and introduce it into a 500- 
ml round-bottomed flask, fitted with an air condenser protected by a calcium 
chloride tube and connected to a gas absorption trap (Fig. 2.61). Immerse the 
flask in an oil bath and heat slowly so that the temperature reaches 1 10— 
120°C at the end of about 30 minutes: the evolution of hydrogen chloride 
then begins. Raise the temperature slowly to 160-165 °C and maintain this 
temperature for 3 hours. Remove the flask from the oil bath and allow to 
cool. Add 280 g of crushed ice followed by 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid in order to decompose the excess of aluminium chloride. Filter the 
resulting solid with suction and wash it with two 80 ml portions of cold water. 
Recrystallise the crude product from 200 ml of 95 per cent ethanol. The yield 
of pure 2,5-dihydroxyacetophenone, m.p. 202-203 °C, is 23 g (58%). Record 
the p.m.r. spectrum (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) and by careful inspection of the 
magnitude of the coupling constants confirm the following assignment of 
signals at 5 2.59 (s, 3H, Me), 6.80 (d, 1H, C 3 — H, measure J 3j4 and note that 
J 3j6 is negligible), 7.06 (d of d, 1H, measure J 3j4 and J 4 , 6 ), 7.24 (d, 1H, 
measure J 4 , 6 ), 9.14 (s, 1H, C 5 — OH), and 11.40 (s, 1H, C 2 — OH, hydrogen- 
bonded). Interpret the m.s. which shows significant ions at m/z 152, 137, 123, 
109 and 43. 

Note. (1) Hydroquinone diacetate may be prepared as follows. Add 1 drop of 
concentrated sulphuric acid to a mixture of 55 g (0.5 mol) of hydroquinone and 102 g 
(95 ml, 1 mol) of acetic anhydride in a 500-ml conical flask. Stir the mixture gently by 
hand; it warms up rapidly and the hydroquinone dissolves. After 5 minutes, pour the 
clear solution on to 400 ml of crushed ice, filter with suction and wash with 500 ml of 
water. Recrystallise the solid from 50 per cent aqueous ethanol (c. 400 ml are 
required). The yield of pure hydroquinone diacetate, m.p. 122 °C, is 89 g (91%).

2-Allylphenol. Boil 50 g of allyl phenyl ether (Expt 6.1 10) gently in a round- 
bottomed flask fitted with an air reflux condenser. Determine the refractive 
index of the mixture at intervals; the rearrangement is complete and the 
boiling is stopped when the refractive index (n") has risen to 1.55 (about 6 
hours are required). Dissolve the product in 100 ml of 5 m sodium hydroxide 
solution and extract with two 30 ml portions of light petroleum (b.p. 40- 
60 °C) which removes the small amount of 2-methyldihydrobenzofuran 
formed as by-product and which is neutral. Carefully acidify the alkaline 
solution with 5 m hydrochloric acid with cooling and extract the mixture with 
one 50 ml portion and two 25 ml portions of ether. Dry the extract over 
anhydrous sodium sulphate and remove the ether with a rotary evaporator. 
Distil the residue under reduced pressure to give 2-allylphenol, b.p. 103- 
106 °C/19 mmHg or b.p. 96 °C/13 mmHg; ntf 1.5440. The yield is 35 g (70%). 

Rearrangement to 2-(prop-l-enyl)phenol. Prepare a saturated solution (about 
50% w/v) of potassium hydroxide in 60 ml of methanol. Place this solution 
together with 20 g of 2-allylphenol in a round-bottomed flask fitted with a 
still-head and condenser set for downward distillation. Arrange a ther- 
mometer so that the bulb dips into the mixture and distil the latter slowly until 
the temperature reaches 110°C. Remove the still-head, attach an air 
condenser to the flask and boil the reaction mixture gently under reflux for 6 
hours. Cool the mixture, cautiously acidify with concentrated hydrochloric 
acid and extract the product with three 30-ml portions of ether. Dry the 
extract, remove the ether and distil the residue under reduced pressure. 
Collect the 2-(prop-l-enyl)phenol as a fraction, b.p. 1 10-1 15 °C/15 mmHg; it 
crystallises on cooling in an ice bath, yield 15 g (75%). Recrystallisation from 
dry light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) gives shining needles, m.p. 37 °C. The i.r. 
and p.m.r. spectra of allyl phenyl ether, 2-allylphenol and 2-(prop-l- 
enyl)phenol should be recorded and critically compared. 

6.9.3 FORMATION OF PHENYL ETHERS 

Examples of the preparation of alkyl benzyl ethers by the Williamson synthesis 
are included in Section 5.6.2, p. 583. An example of an alkyl phenyl ether is 
provided by the synthesis of phenacetin (Expt 6.109) where p-aminophenol is 
first converted into its Af-acetyl derivative by reaction with slightly more than 
one equivalent of acetic anhydride. Treatment of the product with ethanolic 
sodium ethoxide solution followed by ethyl iodide then yields the ethyl ether of 
Af-acetyl-p-phenetidine (phenacetin). This compound is biologically active and 
has been widely employed for example as an antipyretic and analgesic: however, 
owing to undesirable side reactions, its use is now restricted. 

The initial preparation of the sodium derivative of the phenol by treatment 
with sodium ethoxide may be avoided in a number of instances by heating 

984 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.9 



directly the phenol, the alkyl halide and anhydrous potassium carbonate in 
acetone solution. Examples are provided by the preparation of allyl phenyl ether 
and butyl 2-nitrophenyl ether (Expt 6.1 10). A further cognate preparation, that 
of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, is of interest since the product is an 
important plant growth hormone and selective weed-killer. The conversion of 
phenols into phenoxyacetic acids by this route is of value in that these crystalline 
derivatives are useful for the characterisation of the phenolic compounds 
(Section 9.6.6, p. 1248). 

Conversion of phenols into their methyl or ethyl ethers by reaction with the 
corresponding alkyl sulphates in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide 
affords a method which avoids the use of the more expensive alkyl halides (e.g. 
the synthesis of methyl 2-naphthyl ether and veratraldehyde, Expt 6.111). Also 
included in Expt 6.1 1 1 is a general procedure for the alkylation of phenols under 
PTC conditions. 38 ' 39 The method is suitable for 2,6-dialkylphenols, naphthols 
and various functionally substituted phenols. The alkylating agents include 
dimethyl sulphate, diethyl sulphate, methyl iodide, allyl bromide, epichlorohy- 
drin, butyl bromide and benzyl chloride.

dissolves. After 10 minutes, cool, filter the solid acetyl derivative at the pump 
and wash with a little cold water. Recrystallise from hot water (about 75 ml)

Place 1.55 g (0.0675 mol) of clean sodium in a 250-ml round-bottomed

rectified spirit). If all the sodium has not disappeared after the vigorous 
reaction has subsided, warm the flask on a water bath until solution is 
complete. Cool the mixture and add 10 g (0.066 mol) of p-hydroxyacetanilide. 
Introduce 15 g (8 ml, 0.1 mol) of ethyl iodide slowly through the condenser 
and reflux the mixture for 45-60 minutes. Pour 100 ml of water through the 
condenser at such a rate that the crystalline product does not separate; if 
crystals do separate, reflux the mixture until they dissolve. Then cool the flask 
in an ice bath: collect the crude phenacetin with suction and wash with a little 
cold water. Dissolve the crude product in 80 ml of rectified spirit; if the 
solution is coloured, add 2 g of decolourising carbon, boil and filter. Treat the 
clear solution with 125 ml of hot water and allow to cool. Collect the pure 
phenacetin at the pump and dry in the air. The yield is 9.5 g (80%), m.p. 
137 °C. 

The p.m.r. spectrum (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) shows signals at 5 1.30 (t, 3H, Me),

and then reprecipitate it by the addition of acid to the neutralisation point. This 
procedure will eliminate traces of the diacetate of p-aminophenol which may be 
present; the acetyl group attached to nitrogen is not affected by cold dilute alkali, but 
that attached to oxygen is readily hydrolysed by the reagent.

250-ml, two-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and 
sealed stirrer unit, and boil on a steam bath for 8 hours with stirring. Pour the 
reaction mixture into 500 ml of water, separate the organic layer and extract 
the aqueous layer with three 20 ml portions of ether. Wash the combined 
organic layer and ether extracts with 2 m sodium hydroxide solution, and dry 
over anhydrous potassium carbonate. Remove the ether with a rotary

the acetone, add 200 ml of water and extract the product with two 100 ml 
portions of benzene (CAUTION). Wash the combined benzene extracts with 
three 90 ml portions of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, remove the 
benzene by distillation at atmospheric pressure and distil the residue under 
reduced pressure. Collect the o-butoxynitrobenzene at 171-172 °C/19mmHg

Place 8.1 g (0.05 mol) of 2,4-dichlorophenol and 4.7 g (0.05 mol) of chloro- 
acetic acid (CAUTION: causes skin blisters) in a 400-ml beaker; add slowly, 
with stirring, a solution of 4.5 (0.1 12 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 25 ml of 
water. Considerable heat is developed during the reaction. Heat the reaction 
mixture on a wire gauze until most of the liquid has evaporated: treat the 
residue with 150 ml of water, cool and filter if necessary. Acidify the clear 
solution with dilute hydrochloric acid (litmus). Extract the dense oil which 
separates with two 25 ml portions of ether, wash the combined extracts with 
10—1 5 ml of water, dry with 1 g of magnesium sulphate, filter through a fluted 
filter paper and distil off the ether on a rotary evaporator. Recrystallise the 
residue of crude, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid from about 35 ml of benzene

spectrum (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) provides a good example for assignment of 
signals on the basis of measurement of coupling constants; the signals appear 
at 5 4.75 (s, 2H, OCH 2 ), 7.00 (d, 1H, C 6 — H, measure J 5 , 6 and note that J 3 , 6

CAUTION: This preparation should be carried out in an efficient fume

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a separatory funnel, a sealed 
mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. Place 36 g (0.25 mol) of 2-naphthol 
in the flask, add a solution of 10.5 g of sodium hydroxide in 150 ml of water 
and stir the mixture; cool the warm mixture to about 10 °C by immersing the 
flask in an ice bath. Place 31.5 g (23.5 ml, 0.25 mol) of dimethyl sulphate 
(CAUTION: see Section 4.2.24, p. 430) in the separatory funnel and add 
dropwise, during 1 hour, while stirring the mixture vigorously. Warm for 1 
hour at 70-80 °C with stirring in order to complete the methylation. Allow to 
cool and filter off the methyl 2-naphthyl ether at the pump, wash with 10 per 
cent sodium hydroxide solution, then liberally with water and drain 
thoroughly. Recrystallise from industrial spirit. The yield is 33 g (84%), m.p. 
72 °C. 

Cognate preparations. Veratraldehyde (3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde). Place 
152g (lmol) of a good sample of commercial vanillin, m.p. 81-82 °C, in a 1- 
litre three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer 
and two separatory funnels (one of which is supported over the top of the 
reflux condenser). Melt the vanillin by warming on a water bath and stir 
vigorously. Charge one funnel with a solution of 82 g of pure potassium 
hydroxide in 120 ml of water and the other funnel with 160g (120 ml, 
1.04 mol) of purified dimethyl sulphate (CAUTION). Run in the potassium 
hydroxide solution at the rate of two drops a second, and 20 seconds after this 
has started add the dimethyl sulphate at the same rate. Stop the external 
heating after a few minutes; the mixture continues to reflux gently from the 
heat of the reaction. The reaction mixture should be pale reddish-brown since 
this colour indicates that it is alkaline; should the colour change to green, an 
acid reaction is indicated and this condition should be corrected by slightly 
increasing the rate of addition of the alkali. When half to three-quarters of the 
reagents have been added, the reaction mixture becomes turbid and separates 
into two layers. As soon as all the reagents have been run in (about 20 
minutes), pour the yellow reaction mixture into a large porcelain basin and 
allow to cool without disturbance, preferably overnight. Filter the hard 
crystalline mass of veratraldehyde, grind it in a glass mortar with 300 ml of 
ice-cold water, filter at the pump and dry in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of 
veratraldehyde, m.p. 43-44 °C, is 160 g (96%). This product is sufficiently pure 
for most purposes; it can be purified without appreciable loss by distillation 
under reduced pressure, b.p. 1 58 °C/8 mmHg; m.p. 46 °C. The aldehyde is 
easily oxidised in the air and should therefore be kept in a tightly stoppered 
bottle.

add 250 ml of absolute ethanol. If the reaction becomes so vigorous that the 
alcohol cannot be held back by the condenser, direct a stream of cold water 
or place a wet towel on the outside of the flask until it is again under control: 
do not cool the alcohol unduly otherwise the last traces of sodium will take a 
considerable time to dissolve. Add a solution of 47 g (0.5 mol) of pure phenol 
(CAUTION) in 50 ml of absolute ethanol and shake. Into a small separatory 
funnel supported in the top of the condenser, place 133 g (82.5 ml, 0.72 mol) of 
butyl iodide (Expt 5.59) or an equivalent quantity of butyl bromide (Expt 
5.54) and add it, with shaking, during 15 minutes. Boil the solution gently for 
3 hours, arrange the apparatus for downward distillation and distil off as 
much as possible of the alcohol on a water bath; this process is facilitated by 
wrapping the exposed part of the flask in a cloth. Add water to the residue in 
the flask, separate the organic layer and wash it twice with 25 ml portions of 
10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, then successively with water, dilute 
sulphuric acid and water: dry with magnesium sulphate. Distil and collect the 
butyl phenyl ether at 207-208 °C. The yield is 60 g (80%). 

General procedure for the preparation of phenolic ethers under PTC con- 
ditions. 38 A mixture of dichloromethane (50 ml), water (50 ml), the phenol 
(lOmmol), sodium hydroxide (15mmol), the alkylating agent (20-30 mmol) 
and benzyltributylammonium chloride, bromide or iodide (0.1-1.0 mmol) is 
agitated with a vibromix (Section 2.14), at room temperature for 2-12 hours. 
The organic layer is then separated and the aqueous layer extracted twice 
with dichloromethane (20 ml). The combined extracts are evaporated, the 
residue mixed with water and the mixture extracted with ether or pentane. 
The organic extract is washed twice with 2 m ammonia solution to remove 
dimethyl sulphate if necessary (methanolic ammonia in the case of diethyl 
sulphate), then 2 m sodium hydroxide solution (ethanolic sodium hydroxide 
in the case of hindered phenols) and finally with saturated sodium chloride 
solution. After drying with sodium sulphate, the solvent is evaporated and the 
residual phenolic ether purified by distillation or crystallisation. 

When methyl iodide is used as the alkylating agent it is found that the 
reaction proceeds most satisfactorily when a stoichiometric amount of 
quaternary ammonium salt is used. Use of less than one equivalent of catalyst 
results in slow and incomplete reaction due to the inhibition of the catalytic 
effect by iodide. 39 Reactions with benzyl chloride are carried out similarly. 

6.9.4 SOME METHODS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PHENOLIC HYDROXYL GROUP 

The important methods for the protection of phenols are very similar to those 
used for the alcoholic hydroxyl group (Section 5.4.6, p. 550), namely (a) ether 
formation, and (b) ester formation. 

ETHERS 

Section 6.9.3 provides experimental details for the formation of alkyl, allyl and 
benzyl ethers under a range of conditions, including PTC procedures. 

Deprotection of aryl methyl ethers may be effected under strongly acidic 
conditions (e.g. hydriodic acid, Section 9.6.11, p. 1253), but the milder methods 
employing either iodotrimethylsilane in chloroform solution at 20-50 °C for 
several hours, 40 or boron tribromide at room temperature may be preferable. 41

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.10 



General procedure for deprotection of mono- and polymethyl-aryl ethers with 
boron tribromide. 41 To a 10-ml flask fitted with a septum and magnetic stirrer 
bar are added reactant (3.6mmol) and 5 ml of dichloromethane. An inert 
atmosphere is established and maintained. This mixture is cooled in a dry 
ice/propan-2-ol bath and boron tribromide [0.13 ml, 1.32 mmol (for mono- 
methyl ethers), or 0.38 ml, 4 mmol (for dimethyl ethers)] is added through the 
septum by use of a syringe. The cold bath is removed and the mixture stirred for 
30 minutes, poured into ice water, stirred for 30 minutes, saturated with salt and 
extracted with dichloromethane. The extract is dried and concentrated. The 
purity of the product is established by h.p.l.c. analysis on a Waters Associates 
6000A model using both refractive index and u.v. absorbance detectors with a 
Waters 3.9mm i.d. x 30cm ^u-Bondapack Ci 8 reverse phase column. 

Deprotection of allyl aryl ethers is accomplished by protonolysis with 
palladium on activated charcoal in methanol solution in the presence of toluene- 
p-sulphonic acid, 42 or by reduction with sodium bis(2-methoxy- 
ethoxy)aluminium hydride in toluene solution 43 (Aldrich). This latter reagent 
also cleaves aryl benzyl ethers. 

Catechol and other o-dihydroxy aromatic systems may be protected by the 
formation of the methylenedioxy compound, most conveniently achieved by the 
following PTC procedure. 44 A mixture of water (20 ml), dibromomethane 
(0.15mol) and Adogen 464 (1 mmol), is vigorously stirred and heated to reflux. 
The air in the system is displaced by nitrogen. A solution of the appropriate o- 
dihydroxybenzene (0. 1 mol) and sodium hydroxide (0.25 mol) in water (50 ml) is 
added at such a rate that addition is complete after 2 hours. After addition is 
complete, the reaction mixture is stirred and refluxed for a further hour. The 
product is isolated by standard work-up procedures. 

ESTERS 

The general procedures for the formation of acetates, benzoates and toluene-p- 
sulphonates are described in Section 9.6.6, p. 1248. Toluene-p-sulphonates are 
stable to the presence of lithium aluminium hydride, to the acidic conditions 
used in aromatic nitrations and to the high temperatures that might be 
necessary in an Ullmann reaction. 

The most convenient procedure for deprotection of these esters is aqueous 
alkaline hydrolysis; a general procedure for this operation, including possible 
variations in technique which might be required in certain instances, is discussed 
in Section 9.6.17, p. 1266. 



6.10 AROMATIC ALDEHYDES 

Aromatic aldehydes may be prepared by the following general procedures. 

1. Aromatic formylation reactions (Expts 6.112 to 6.116). 

2. Reactions involving modification of aromatic ring substituents (Expts 6.117 
to 6.120). 

Methods for the protection of the carbonyl group are considered in Section 
6.12.8, p. 1056.

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The electron-withdrawing mesomeric interaction of the carbonyl group with the 
aromatic system results in the i.r. absorption frequency of its stretching 
vibration being lower than that exhibited in aliphatic aldehydes (p. 299). The 
absorption arising from the stretching vibration of the H— CO bond is also 
clearly observed (Fig. 3.30; anisaldehyde). This hydrogen may also be readily 
assigned in the p.m.r. spectrum of aromatic aldehydes and distinguished from 
other low field signals arising from acidic or phenolic protons, since the signal is 
unaffected by treatment of the sample with deuterium oxide. Aromatic 
substitution patterns are frequently assignable by inspection of both i.r. and 
p.m.r. spectra. The fragmentation patterns observed in the m.s. of aromatic 
aldehydes is illustrated and discussed in the case of benzaldehyde on p. 378. 
Further descriptive accounts of structural assignments are to be found in the 
preparative examples below. 



6.10.1 AROMATIC F0RMYLATI0N REACTIONS 

Aromatic aldehydes may be obtained by passing a mixture of carbon monoxide 
and hydrogen chloride into the aromatic hydrocarbon in the presence of a 
mixture of copper(i) chloride and aluminium chloride which acts as a catalyst 
(Gatterman-Koch reaction). It is probable that the electrophilic species is the

the Lewis acid. The preparation of p-tolualdehyde by this method has been 
described. 45

The Gatterman-Koch formylation is unsuitable for the preparation of alde- 
hydes from phenols and phenolic ethers owing to the formation of complexes with 
the Lewis acid. 

A convenient method for the introduction of a formyl group, specifically in 
the ortho position of a phenol, involves reaction with tin(iv) chloride in the 
presence of tributylamine followed by treatment with paraformaldehyde. 46 It is 
applicable to phenols with other electron-donating or -withdrawing substitu- 
ents, and is illustrated by the conversion of p-cresol into 5-methyl-2- 
hydroxybenzaldehyde (Expt 6.112). The reaction is thought to proceed via two 
successive six-membered coordinated tin complexes.

tion), and 1,3-dithiane. 

The Gatterman aldehyde synthesis employs hydrogen cyanide and unlike the 
Gatterman-Koch procedure, this method is successful in the case of phenols and 
phenolic ethers, although only the more reactive hydrocarbons are formylated 

in good yield. The mechanism probably involves the species [H — C=NH] as 
the effective electrophile.

One alternative which avoids the use of the hazardous hydrogen cyanide is 
passing dry hydrogen chloride either into a mixture of zinc cyanide, aluminium 
chloride, the hydrocarbon or phenolic ether and a solvent (such as tetra- 
chloroethane or benzene), or into a mixture of zinc cyanide, the phenol and 
anhydrous ether or benzene. The zinc cyanide is converted by the hydrogen 
chloride into hydrogen cyanide (which reacts in situ), and zinc chloride which is 
known to be an effective catalyst in this reaction. A second alternative, which is 
applicable to hydrocarbons only, is to use acetone cyanohydrin as an in situ 
source of hydrogen cyanide. 47 The preparation of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde 
(mesitaldehyde) from mesitylene and the related cognate preparations (Expt 
6.113) provides a varied range of examples. 

Certain reactive aromatic hydrocarbons are formylated by dimethylforma- 
mide in the presence of phosphorus oxychloride (the Vilsmeier reaction, e.g. 9- 
formylanthracene, Expt 6.1 14). This method can also be used with advantage for 
the formylation of 7r-excessive heteroaromatic systems (e.g. 2-formylthiophene, 
cognate preparation in Expt 6.114).

A generally applicable method of formylation involves the reaction of an 
aromatic hydrocarbon and dichloromethyl methyl ether under Friedel-Crafts 
conditions (cf. Section 6.11.1, p. 1006). The intermediate chloroacetal (1) thus 
formed is readily hydrolysed to the corresponding aldehyde (e.g. p-t- 
butylbenzaldehyde, Expt 6.115).

The procedure is of value for the formylation of polycyclic aromatic and 
heteroaromatic systems, phenols and phenolic ethers. 

Phenols are smoothly converted into phenolic aldehydes by reaction with 
chloroform in the presence of base (the Reimer-Tiemann reaction). This overall 
formylation reaction is of interest in that it involves the generation from 
chloroform and alkali of the reactive intermediate, dichlorocarbene (2). This 
effects electrophilic substitution in the reactive phenolate ions giving the 
benzylidene dichloride (3) which is hydrolysed by the alkaline medium to 
the corresponding hydroxyaldehyde. The phenolic aldehyde is isolated from 
the reaction medium after acidification.

In the case of phenol the main product is o-hydroxybenzaldehyde (salicylalde- 
hyde, Expt 6.116), but some of the para isomer is also formed. The isomers are 
separated by steam distillation in which only the ortho isomer is steam volatile 
owing to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. In the cognate preparation (2- 
hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde) the preferential reaction at the 1 -position should be 
noted. 




Finally, it should be noted that a specific ortho formylation process which 
uses 1,3-dithiane as a formaldehyde equivalent has been described. 48 The 
reaction process appears to be of wide applicability and is similar to the ortho 
formylation of primary aromatic amines which has been described by the same 
authors (see p. 909). 

Experiment 6.112 5-METHYL-2-HYDROXYBENZALDEHYDE 46 

CHO 

To a four-necked round-bottomed flask (2.5 litres) equipped with a reflux 
condenser, mechanical stirrer, thermometer and nitrogen supply, are added 
anhydrous toluene (200 ml), p-cresol (108 g, 1.0 mol), tin(iv) chloride (26 g, 
0.1 mol) (1) and tributylamine (74 g, 0.4 mol). The mixture is stirred for 20 
minutes at room temperature, then paraformaldehyde (66 g) is added. The 
resulting yellowish solution is heated at 100 + 0.5 °C for 8 hours. After 
cooling, the reaction mixture is poured into water (5 litres), acidified to pH 2 
with 2 m hydrochloric acid and extracted with ether. The ether extract is 
washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous 
sodium sulphate and concentrated to leave the crude product, which is 
subjected to steam distillation. The final product is obtained in 86 per cent 
yield, m.p. 55-56 °C. 

Note. (1) The commercially available anhydrous reagent should be used.

Method A (use of zinc cyanide). CAUTION: The entire preparation should be 
conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. Tetrachloroethane is a potent poison 
and hydrogen cyanide is liberated during the reaction. 

Equip a 500-ml multi-necked flange flask with a reflux condenser, an 
efficient stirrer, a gas-inlet tube and a thermometer; the thermometer should 
be so sited that during the subsequent reaction the bulb is well immersed in 
the liquid, but the gas inlet tube need extend only just below the surface. Place 
51 g (59ml, 0.425mol) of redistilled mesitylene (b.p. 163-166 °C), 73.5g 
(0.625 mol) of zinc cyanide (Section 4.2.81, p. 467) and 200 ml of 1,1,2,2- 
tetrachloroethane in the flask, and stir the mixture while a rapid stream of dry 
hydrogen chloride (Section 4.2.38, p. 438) is passed through it until the zinc 
cyanide is decomposed (about 3 hours). Immerse the flask in a bath of 
crushed ice, remove the inlet tube and replace it by means of the arrangement 
depicted in Fig. 2.57, having previously charged the conical flask with 197 g of 
finely ground, anhydrous aluminium chloride. Stir the mixture very vigor- 
ously and add the aluminium chloride over a period of 10 minutes. Remove 
the ice bath, and resume the passage of hydrogen chloride gas for 3.5 hours; 
the heat of reaction will raise the temperature to about 70 °C at the end of an 
hour. Maintain the temperature at 67-72 °C for the remainder of the reaction 
period. Cool, and pour the reaction mixture, with hand stirring, into a 2-litre 
beaker about half-full of crushed ice to which 50 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid has been added. Allow to stand overnight, transfer to a 1.5- 
litre round-bottomed flask, fit a condenser and reflux for 3 hours. Allow to 
cool, separate the organic layer and extract the aqueous layer once with 25 ml 
of tetrachloroethane. Wash the combined tetrachloroethane solutions with 
75 ml of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution, and steam distil (Fig. 2.102). 
Set the first 400-450 ml of distillate aside for the recovery of the solvent (1), 
and collect the second portion (about 4.5 litres) as long as oily drops pass 
over. Extract the distillate with 250 ml of toluene, dry the extract with a little 
magnesium sulphate and remove the solvent on an oil bath or a rotary 
evaporator. Distil the residue from a 150-ml flask with a fractionating side- 
arm (compare Fig. 2.108), and collect the mesitaldehyde at 118- 
121 °C/16mmHg; the yield is 50 g (79%) (2). 

The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) shows signals at 3 2.30 (s, 3H, C 4 — 
Me), 2.59 (s, 6H, C 2 — Me and C 6 — Me), 6.85 (s, 2H, C 3 — H, and C 5 — H), and 
10.50 (s, 1H, CHO). The m.s. gives significant fragment ions at m/z 148 (M), 
147 (M - H, base peak), 1 19 (147 - CO), 105 (1 19 - CH 2 ), 91 (105 - CH 2 ), 
and 77 (91 - CH 2 ). 

Notes. (1) The first portion of the steam distillate consists almost entirely of 
tetrachloroethane and water. The solvent is recovered by separating the organic layer, 
drying with anhydrous calcium chloride or magnesium sulphate and distilling. 
(2) The following procedure is more convenient and less time-consuming, but the yield 
is lower (about 40 g). Mix the powdered aluminium chloride and zinc cyanide by 
shaking, add the mesitylene and immerse the flask in an oil bath at 100 °C. Stir the 
mixture and pass in a fairly rapid stream of dry hydrogen chloride for 4 hours; continue 



994 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.10 



the heating and stirring for a further 2 hours, but discontinue the passage of the gas. 
Decompose the reaction mixture, and complete the preparation as above. 

Method B (use of acetone cyanohydrin).* 7 A mixture of mesitylene (6g, 
0.05 mol) and acetone cyanohydrin (4.2, 0.05 mol) (Expt 5.168) in 1,2- 
dichloroethane (20ml) is cooled to 0°C. Aluminium chloride (13.3 g, 0.1 mol) 
is slowly added to the stirred mixture which is then allowed to warm to room 
temperature. After refluxing for 24 hours the mixture is hydrolysed and 
extracted with 1,2-dichloroethane. The organic layer is washed, neutralised 
and dried over magnesium sulphate. The solvent is evaporated and the crude 
product distilled to yield 3.5 g (48%) of 2,4,6-trimethylbenzaldehyde, b.p. 
71°C/9mmHg. 

Cognate preparations. Method A 2,4-Dihydroxybenzaldehyde 

(fl-resorcylaldehyde). Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a reflux 
condenser, an efficient sealed stirrer and a wide inlet tube (to prevent clogging 
by the precipitate) extending nearly to the bottom of the vessel. Attach the 
inlet tube to an empty (safety) wash bottle and to this a generator producing 
hydrogen chloride (Section 4.2.38, p. 438); connect the top of the condenser 
by means of a tube to a wash bottle containing concentrated sulphuric acid, 
then to an empty bottle, and finally to the surface of sodium hydroxide 
solution (Fig. 2.61(a)). Place 20 g (0.18 mol) of resorcinol, 175 ml of sodium- 
dried ether and 40 g (0.34 mol) of powdered anhydrous zinc cyanide in the 
flask, start the stirrer and pass in a rapid stream of hydrogen chloride. The 
zinc cyanide gradually disappears with the formation of a cloudy solution; 
further passage of hydrogen chloride results in the separation of the imine 
hydrochloride condensation product as a thick oil which solidifies after 10- 
30 minutes. When the ether is saturated with hydrogen chloride (after about 
1.5 hours), pass the gas more slowly and continue the stirring for a further 
half an hour to ensure the completeness of the reaction. Decant the ether from 
the solid material, add 100 ml of water to the latter, heat to the boiling point, 
filter the hot solution through a hot water funnel and allow the filtrate to 
cool. Filter the resorcylaldehyde (12 g) which separates as soon as the mixture 
is cold; allow the filtrate to stand for 15 hours when a further 1 1.5 g of the 
aldehyde is obtained (total yield 94%). The /J-resorcylaldehyde, after drying, 
has m.p. 135-136 °C and is very faintly coloured. The colour may be removed 
by recrystallisation from hot water with the addition of a little decolourising 
carbon. 

2-Hydroxy-l-naphthaldehyde. Proceed as for /J-resorcylaldehyde except that 
20 g (0.138 mol) of 2-naphthol replaces the resorcinol. Recrystallise the crude 
product (20 g, 83%) from water with the addition of a little decolourising 
carbon; the pure aldehyde has m.p. 80-8 1 °C. 

Anisaldehyde (p-methoxybenzaldehyde). Use the apparatus described for /?- 
resorcylaldehyde. Place 30 g (30 ml, 0.28 mol) of anisole, 75 ml of sodium- 
dried benzene (CAUTION) and 52 g (0.44 mol) of powdered zinc cyanide in 
the flask. Cool the mixture in a bath of cold water, start the stirrer and pass in 
a rapid stream of hydrogen chloride for 1 hour. Remove the gas inlet tube, 
and without stopping the stirrer, add 45 g of finely powdered anhydrous 
aluminium chloride slowly. Replace the gas inlet and pass in a slow steam of 
hydrogen chloride while heating the mixture at 40-45 °C for 3-4 hours. Allow 

995 



6.10 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



to cool somewhat and pour the reaction mixture with stirring into excess of 
dilute hydrochloric acid; the imine hydrochloride separates as a heavy 
precipitate. Reflux the mixture for half an hour in order to decompose the 
imine hydrochloride and steam distil. Separate the organic layer in the 
distillate, dry with a little anhydrous magnesium sulphate and distil off 
the benzene. Continue distillation with an air bath and collect the anisaldehyde 
as a fraction which has a b.p. 246-248 °C; the yield is 35 g (92%). If required 
the product may be redistilled under reduced pressure, b.p. 134— 
135°C/12mmHg. The i.r. spectrum is given on p. 301; the p.m.r. spectrum 
should be recorded and interpreted.

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a sealed stirrer unit, a reflux 
condenser and a dropping funnel. Assemble the apparatus on a water bath in 
a fume cupboard. Place in the flask a mixture of 17.8 g (0.1 mol) of anthracene 
(1), 19 g (20 ml, 0.26 mol) of dimethylformamide and 20 ml of o- 
dichlorobenzene (2), and charge the dropping funnel with 27 g (16 ml, 
0.175 mol) of phosphorus oxychloride; close the condenser and dropping 
funnel with calcium chloride guard-tubes. Start the stirrer, run in the 
phosphorus oxychloride steadily and then heat on a boiling water bath for 2 
hours. Cool the reaction flask in an ice-salt bath and neutralise the contents 
to Congo red by running in aqueous sodium acetate solution (about lOOg of 
the trihydrate in 175 ml of water are required). Dilute with more water to 
about 2 litres and allow the mixture to stand at °C for 2 hours. Filter off the 
yellow crystalline product and recrystallise it from aqueous acetic acid; the 
yield of 9-formylanthracene is 12 g (58%), m.p. 104 °C. 

Notes. (1) Good quality material should be used; commercial fluorescent grade of 
m.p. c. 215 °C is suitable. 

(2) The use of o-dichlorobenzene as a solvent is recommended. If the reaction is 
carried out in excess dimethylformamide alone, the product is contaminated with 
unreacted anthracene. It is then best to extract the crude material with cold methanol, 
remove the anthracene by filtration and recover the product by dilution with water. 

Cognate preparation. 2-Formylthiophene (thiophene-2-aldehyde). Use 21 g 
(19.3 ml, 0.25 mol) of thiophene, 23 g (24 ml, 0.315 mol) of dimethylformamide 
and 80 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane as solvent. Cool to 0°C, add 48 g (29 ml, 
0.313 mol) of phosphorus oxychloride slowly with stirring, and then heat, 
carefully at first, and then under reflux for 2 hours. Cool, pour on to crushed 
ice, neutralise with sodium acetate (c. 200 g of the hydrate), separate the

organic phases with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, dry over mag-

fraction of b.p. 85-86 °C/16mmHg; yield 20g (71%). Record the p.m.r. 
spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) and assign the signals which appear at S 7.12 (t, 1H), 
7.67 (d, 2H), and 9.86 (s, 1H), bearing in mind that the protons on C 3 and C 5 
appear equivalent (cf. furan-2-aldehyde, cognate preparation in Expt 6.133).

Equip a 250-ml three-necked flask with a thermometer, reflux condenser, 
dropping funnel (protected with a calcium chloride guard-tube) and magnetic 
stirrer, and attach a gas absorption trap to the top of the condenser; assemble 
the apparatus in the fume cupboard. Place 15.1 g (0.12mol) of t-butyl benzene 
(Expt 6.5) and 60 ml of dry dichloromethane (Section 4.1.5, p. 399) in the flask 
and cool to 0-5 °C in an ice-salt bath. To the stirred solution add 38 g (22 ml, 
0.2 mol) of titanium (iv) chloride rapidly from the dropping funnel (2 to 3 
minutes); the mixture becomes orange. Then add 1 1.5 g (0.1 mol) of 
dichloromethyl methyl ether (Expt 5.71) (CAUTION) during 20 minutes to 
the stirred and cooled solution. Hydrogen chloride is evolved after the first 
few drops of the ether are added. Stir the mixture for 5 minutes after 
completion of the addition, remove the cooling bath, allow the mixture to 
warm to room temperature (about half an hour) and then heat at 35 °C for 15 
minutes. Pour the mixture into a separating funnel containing 100 g of ice and 
shake thoroughly. Separate the lower organic layer and extract the aqueous 
layer with three 25 ml portions of dichloromethane. Wash the combined 
dichloromethane extracts with three 25 ml portions of water, add a crystal of 
hydroquinone to prevent oxidation of the aldehyde and dry over magnesium 
sulphate. Filter the solution, remove the solvent by flash distillation and distil 
the residue under reduced pressure through a short fractionating column. 
The fraction which distils at 52°C/4mmHg is t-butylbenzene; collect the 
p-t-butylbenzaldehyde as a fraction of b.p. 98 °C/4mmHg; the yield is 10.8 g 
(67%).

(0.266 mol) of phenol (CAUTION) in 25 ml of water and stir. Adjust the 
temperature inside the flask to 60-65 °C (by warming on a water bath or by 
cooling, as may be found necessary); do not allow the crystalline sodium 
phenoxide to separate out. Introduce 60 g (40.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of chloroform 
(CAUTION) in three portions at intervals of 1 5 minutes down the condenser. 

997 



6.10 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Maintain the temperature of the well-stirred mixture at 65-70 °C during the 
addition by immersing the flask in hot or cold water as may be required. 
Finally heat on a boiling water bath for 1 hour to complete the reaction. 
Remove the excess of chloroform from the alkaline solution by steam 
distillation (Fig. 2.102). Allow to cool, acidify the orange-coloured liquid 
cautiously with dilute sulphuric acid and again steam distil the almost 
colourless liquid until no more oily drops are collected. Set aside the residue 
in the flask for the isolation of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Extract the distillate 
at once with ether, remove most of the ether from the extract by distillation 
on a water bath using a rotary evaporator. Transfer the residue, which 
contains phenol as well as salicylaldehyde, to a small glass-stoppered flask, 
add about twice the volume of saturated sodium metabisulphite solution, and 
shake vigorously (preferably mechanically) for at least half an hour, and 
allow to stand for 1 hour. Filter the paste of bisulphite compound at the 
pump, wash it with a little alcohol, and finally with a little ether (to remove 
the phenol). Decompose the bisulphite compound by warming in a round- 
bottomed flask on a water bath with dilute sulphuric acid, allow to cool, 
extract the salicylaldehyde with ether and dry the extract with anhydrous 
magnesium sulphate. Remove the ether by flash distillation and distil the 
residue collecting the salicylaldehyde (a colourless liquid) at 195-197 °C. The 
yield is 12 g (37%). 

To isolate the p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, filter the residue from the steam 
distillation while hot through a fluted filter paper in order to remove resinous 
matter, and extract the cold filtrate with ether. Distil off the ether, and 
recrystallise the yellow solid from hot water to which some aqueous 
sulphurous acid is added. The yield of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (colourless 
crystals), m.p. 116 °C, is 2-3 g (6-9%). 

Record the i.r. spectrum of both isomers and assign the OH and CHO 
bands. The substitution patterns may be confirmed by comparison of their 
p.m.r. spectra (Me 2 CO-d 6 , TMS); for the para isomer the signals appear at 6 
7.04 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to OH), 7.86 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to CHO), 8.73 (s, 1H, 
OH), and 8.73 (s, 1H, CHO); for the ortho isomer, wherein hydrogen bonding 
exists, the two signals at 3 9.80 and 10.98 may be assigned to either the OH or 
CHO groups, and the aromatic protons appear as two groups of complex 
multiplets at 3 6.7-7.1 and 7.3-7.7. The m.s., which shows the following 
principal fragment ions for either isomer, should be interpreted; m/z 122, 121, 
104, 93, 65, and 39. 

Cognate preparation. 2-Hydroxy-l-naphthaldehyde. Equip a 1 -litre three- 
necked flask with a separatory funnel, a sealed mechanical stirrer and a 
double surface reflux condenser. Place 50 g of 2-naphthol and 1 50 ml of 
rectified spirit in the flask, start the stirrer and rapidly add a solution of 100 g 
of sodium hydroxide in 210ml of water. Heat the resulting solution to 70^ 
80 °C on a water bath, and place 62 g (42 ml) of pure chloroform 
(CAUTION) in the separatory funnel. Introduce the chloroform dropwise 
until reaction commences (indicated by the formation of a deep blue colour), 
remove the water bath and continue the addition of the chloroform at such a 
rate that the mixture refluxes gently (about 1.5 hours). The sodium salt of the 
phenolic aldehyde separates near the end of the addition. Continue the 
stirring for a further 1 hour. Set the condenser for downward distillation (but

retaining the stirrer) and distil off the excess chloroform and alcohol. Treat 
the residue, with stirring, dropwise with concentrated hydrochloric acid until 
the contents of the flask are acid to Congo red paper (about 88 ml are 
required); a dark oil, accompanied by a considerable amount of sodium 
chloride, separates. Add sufficient water to dissolve the salt, extract the oil 
with ether, wash the ethereal solution with water, dry with anhydrous 
magnesium sulphate and remove the solvent. Distil the residue under reduced 
pressure and collect the slightly coloured aldehyde at 177-1 80 °C/20mmHg; 
it solidifies on cooling. Recrystallise the solid from about 40 ml of ethanol. 
The yield of 2-hydroxy-l-naphthaldehyde, m.p. 80 °C, is 28 g (47%). 

6.10.2 REACTIONS INVOLVING MODIFICATIONS OF AROMATIC RING SUBSTITUENTS 

Several procedures for the synthesis of aromatic aldehydes are available which 
involve the selective oxidation of a methyl group attached to an aromatic ring. A 
useful general reagent is a solution of chromium trioxide in acetic anhydride and 
acetic acid. The aldehyde is converted into the gem-diacetate as it is formed and 
is thus protected from further oxidation. The aldehyde is liberated from the 
diacetate by hydrolysis under acid conditions; the yields, however, are frequently 
only moderate (e.g. p-nitrobenzaldehyde, Expt 6.117). 

Ar-Me ,» ^ n &gt; Ar-CH(0-CO-Me) 2 -^^ Ar-CHO 

(Me-COfcO 

Aldehydes may also be obtained by the hydrolysis of gem-dihalogen 
compounds obtained by the side-chain halogenation of a methylarene. 

Ar-Me -^ Ar-CHBr 2 -^&gt; Ar-CHO 

Side-chain bromination occurs under the influence of light (cf. Expt 6.28) and 
the extent of bromination is controlled by ensuring that the bromine (used in the 
theoretical amount) is added no faster than the rate at which it is consumed. The 
halogen in the benzylidene halide is reactive and hydrolysis occurs readily under 
mild conditions. In the example cited ( p-bromobenzaldehyde, Expt 6.118) the 
use of a boiling aqueous suspension of calcium carbonate gives good results. 

Aromatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes can alternatively be prepared from 
the corresponding methyl compound by subjecting the chloromethyl or 
bromomethyl derivative to the Sommelet reaction. This procedure involves an 
initial reaction between the halomethyl compound and hexamethylenetetramine 
(hexamine), and hydrolysing the resulting quaternary hexamine salt (4) with hot 
aqueous acetic acid.

The mechanism of the reaction is not certain but hydrolysis of the salt may yield 
the primary amine (5), formaldehyde and ammonia. A hydride ion transfer then 
probably occurs between the benzylamine and the protonated aldimine (6), 
derived from formaldehyde and ammonia. Hydrolysis of the resulting aromatic 
aldimine (7) then yields the required aldehyde.

A typical procedure is that described in Expt 6.119 for the synthesis of 1- 
naphthaldehyde. The synthesis of p-nitrobenzaldehyde provides an example in 
which the intermediate crystalline hexamine salt is isolated prior to hydrolysis. 
2-Naphthaldehyde is prepared from the bromomethyl compound, the prepar- 
ation of which illustrates the use of Af-bromosuccinimide for effecting benzylic 
bromination of 2-methylnaphthalene. 

Acid chlorides can be selectively hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst 
(palladium deposited on a carrier, which is usually barium sulphate but is 
occasionally charcoal). The reaction, which involves the hydrogenolysis of the 
carbon-halogen bond, is known as the Rosenmund reduction and has been widely 
used for the synthesis of aromatic and heterocyclic aldehydes.

The procedure is to pass purified hydrogen through a hot solution of the pure 
acid chloride in toluene or xylene in the presence of a catalyst; the exit gases are 
bubbled through water to absorb the hydrogen chloride, and the solution is 
titrated with standard alkali from time to time so that the reduction may be 
stopped when the theoretical quantity of hydrogen chloride has been evolved. 
Further reduction of the aldehyde, leading to the corresponding alcohol and 
thence to the methylarene, can usually be prevented by using the appropriate 
catalyst poison or regulator, which inactivates the catalyst towards reduction of 
the aldehyde but not the acid chloride. The regulator usually contains sulphur, 
e.g. quinoline-sulphur or thiourea; its use is not always necessary, however, and 
it has been stated that the decisive factors are to keep the reaction mixture at the 
lowest temperature at which hydrogen chloride is liberated and to arrest the 
reaction as soon as 1 mol of hydrogen chloride is evolved. The reduction is 
illustrated by the synthesis of 2-naphthaldehyde (Expt 6.120). 

An alternative procedure 49 for effecting the conversion of acid chlorides into 
aldehydes is chemical reduction with bis(triphenylphosphine)copper(i) tetrahy- 
droborate (see also Section 5.7.4, p. 594). The procedure is illustrated by the 
synthesis of 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde which is isolated as the 2,4-dinitro- 
phenylhydrazine derivative 50 (cognate preparation in Expt 6.120).

200 g (1 85 ml, 2 mol) of acetic anhydride and 25 g (0. 1 8 mol) of p-nitrotoluene 
in the flask, and add slowly, with stirring, 40 ml of concentrated sulphuric 
acid. When the temperature has fallen to °C introduce slowly, with stirring, 
a solution of 50 g (0.5 mol) of chromium trioxide in 225 ml of acetic anhydride 
(1), at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 10 °C; continue 
stirring for 2 hours after all the chromium trioxide solution has been added. 
Pour the contents of the flask into a 3-litre beaker one-third filled with 
crushed ice and almost fill the beaker with cold water. Filter the solid at the 
pump and wash it with cold water until the washings are colourless. Suspend 
the product in 1 50 ml of cold 2 per cent sodium carbonate solution and stir 
mechanically for about 10-15 minutes; filter, wash with cold water, and 
finally with 10 ml of ethanol. Dry in a vacuum desiccator; the yield of crude 
p-nitrobenzylidene diacetate is 30g (65%) (2). 

Reflux the crude p-nitrobenzylidene diacetate with a mixture of 70 ml of 
ethanol, 70 ml of water and 7 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid for 30 
minutes, filter through a fluted filter paper and cool the filtrate in ice. Collect 
the crystals by suction filtration, wash with cold water and dry in a vacuum 
desiccator. The yield of p-nitrobenzaldehyde, m.p. 106 °C, is 15 g (55% 
overall). The spectroscopic characteristics are discussed with those of the 
ortho isomer, cognate preparation below. 

Notes. (1) The solution is prepared by adding the chromium trioxide portion wise to 

the well-cooled acetic anhydride. Addition of the anhydride to the oxide in bulk may 

lead to explosive decomposition. 

(2) The pure diacetate may be isolated by dissolving in 100 ml of hot ethanol, filtering 

from any insoluble impurities and allowing to cool: 28 g (61%), m.p. 125-126 °C, are 

obtained. 

Cognate preparations. o-Nitrobenzaldehyde. Use 25 g (0.1 8 mol) of 
o-nitrotoluene and proceed as for p-nitrobenzaldehyde, but allow a period of 3 
hours stirring at 5-10 °C after the addition of the chromium trioxide solution. 
In the work-up, omit the final ethanol washing; to remove unchanged 
o-nitrotoluene boil the crude product under reflux for 30 minutes with 120 ml of 
light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C). The yield of o-nitrobenzylidene diacetate of 
m.p. 82-84 °C is 16 g (36%). 

Suspend 16 g of the diacetate in a mixture of 85 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid, 140 ml of water and 25 ml of ethanol and boil under reflux 
for 45 minutes. Cool the mixture to °C, filter the solid with suction and wash 
with water. Purify the crude aldehyde by rapid steam distillation; collect 
about 1 litre of distillate during 1 5 minutes, cool, filter and dry in a vacuum 
desiccator over calcium chloride. The yield of pure o-nitrobenzaldehyde, m.p. 
44-45 °C, is 7.5 g (28% overall). The crude solid may also be purified after 
drying either by distillation under reduced pressure (the distillate of rather 
wide b.p. range, e.g. 120-144 °C/3-6 mmHg, is quite pure) or by dissolution in 
toluene (2-2.5 ml per gram) and precipitation with light petroleum, b.p. 40- 
60 °C (7 ml per ml of solution). The substitution pattern of the ortho and para 
isomers is confirmed by their p.m.r. spectra (CDC1 3 , TMS) which should be 
compared with that of the meta isomer (p. 856). For the para isomer signals 
appear at 3 8.09 (d, 2H, ortho-U's to CHO), 8.39 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to N0 2 ), 
and 10.19 (s, 1H, CHO); for the ortho isomer signals appear at 3 7.63-8.2 
(m, 4H, C AR — H), and 10.31 (s, 1H, CHO).

CAUTION: This preparation should be carried out in the fume cupboard. 

Equip a 1 -litre multi-necked flange flask with a reflux condenser, a 
mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel and a thermometer which reaches 
nearly to the bottom of the flask; connect the upper end of the condenser to 
an absorption trap (Fig. 2.61). Place lOOg (65ml, 0.58 mol) of p- 
bromotoluene (Expt 6.72) in the flask and immerse the latter in an oil bath 
(colourless oil in a large beaker). Heat the bath until the temperature of the 
stirred p-bromotoluene reaches 105 °C. Illuminate the liquid with an 
unfrosted 150-watt tungsten lamp, and add 200g (1.25 mol) of bromine 
(CAUTION) slowly from the dropping funnel: do not allow a large excess of 
bromine to accumulate in the reaction mixture. Add about one half of the 
bromine during 1 hour while the temperature is kept at 105-1 10 °C, and add 
the remainder during 2 hours while the temperature is slowly raised to 
135 °C. Raise the temperature slowly to 150 °C when all the bromine has been 
introduced. Transfer the crude p-bromobenzylidene dibromide (1) to a 2-litre 
flask, mix it intimately with 200 g of precipitated calcium carbonate and then 
add about 300 ml of water. Attach a reflux condenser to the flask, heat the 
mixture first on a water bath and then on a wire gauze over a free flame with 
continuous shaking until the liquid boils (2); reflux the mixture for 15 hours 
to complete the hydrolysis. Steam distil the reaction mixture rapidly (3); 
collect the first 1 litre of distillate separately, filter oft" the product and dry in a 
vacuum desiccator; 60 g (56%) of pure p-bromobenzaldehyde, m.p. 56-57 °C, 
are thus obtained. Collect a further 2 litres of distillate (4); this yields about 
15 g of a less pure product, m.p. 52-56 °C. Purify this by trituration with 
saturated sodium bisulphite solution (2 ml per gram) and, after about 3 
hours, filter oft" the pasty mixture at the pump, wash it with alcohol and then 
with ether. Transfer the bisulphite compound to a flask fitted for steam 
distillation (Fig. 2.102), add excess of sodium carbonate solution and isolate 
the aldehyde by steam distillation; 13 g (12%) of p-bromobenzaldehyde, m.p. 
56-57 °C, are thus collected. The p.m.r. spectrum should be recorded and 
interpreted. 

Notes. (1) This compound is lachrymatory and also produces a burning sensation on 
the skin; the latter is relieved by washing the affected parts with alcohol. 

(2) This gradual heating reduces the risk of breaking the flask. 

(3) The best results are obtained by conducting the steam distillation in a large three- 
necked flask provided with a sealed stirrer unit in the central aperture; the aldehyde 
distils slowly unless the mixture is well stirred. 

(4) If the solution in the flask is acidified with hydrochloric acid, about 8 g of crude 
p-bromobenzoic acid may be isolated.

to avoid contact with these substances.] Heat the mixture under reflux for 2 
hours; it becomes homogeneous after about 15 minutes and then an oil 
commences to separate. Add 100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 
reflux for a further 15 minutes; this will hydrolyse any Schiffs bases which 
may be formed from amine and aldehyde present and will also convert any 
amines into the ether-insoluble hydrochlorides. Cool, and extract the mixture

Fit a 250-ml three-necked flask with a reflux condenser, a high-speed sealed

the stirrer. Place 28.5 g (0.15 mol) of 2-naphthoyl chloride (Expt 6.161), 
100 ml of sodium-dried xylene, 3 g of palladium-barium sulphate catalyst and 
0.3 ml of the stock poison solution (Section 4.2.54, p. 452) in the flask. 
Connect the top of the condenser by a rubber tube to a 6-mm glass tube 
extending to the bottom of a 250-ml conical flask containing 200 ml of 
distilled water and a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator; arrange a 
burette charged with c. 1m sodium hydroxide solution (prepared from the 
pure solid) for delivery into the flask. The apparatus must be sited in the fume 
cupboard. 

Displace the air in the reaction flask with hydrogen from a cylinder of the 
gas, heat the flask in an oil bath at 140-150 °C, and stir the mixture 
vigorously. Continue to pass hydrogen at such a rate that 1-2 bubbles per 
second emerge in the conical flask. Follow the course of the reaction by the 
rate of hydrogen chloride evolution. The first 25 ml of alkali should be 
neutralised in 12-15 minutes, and the reaction should be complete in about 2 
hours. About 92 per cent of the theoretical amount of hydrogen chloride 
( = 142.5 ml of 1 m NaOH solution) is recovered; the end of the reaction is 
indicated by a rather abrupt cessation of hydrogen chloride evolution. Cool 
the flask add 1 g of decolourising carbon with stirring and filter the solution 
with suction through a hardened filter paper and keep the spent catalyst for 
recovery. Remove the xylene by flash distillation using a 50-75 ml flask with 
fractionating side-arm and then distil under reduced pressure with the aid of 
an oil bath: a small fraction, consisting largely of naphthalene, passes over 
first, followed by 2-naphthaldehyde at 147-149 °C/1 1 mmHg (temperature of 
bath, 170-180 °C). This (19g, 81%) solidifies on cooling to a white solid, m.p. 
59-60 °C. 

Note. (1) Rapid stirring is desirable in order to obtain the maximum reaction rate; 
absorption of hydrogen occurs chiefly at the rapidly agitated surface.

temperature, bis(triphenylphosphine)copper(i) tetrahydroborate (3.47 g, 
5.8 mmol) (Section 4.2.49, p. 449) is added and the reaction mixture stirred for 
45 minutes. The white precipitate of triphenylphosphine copper chloride 
(4.9 g, 5.5 mmol) is removed by filtration and the filtrate evaporated to 
dryness. The residue is extracted with ether (the ether-insoluble residue is 
shown to be triphenylphosphine borane). The ether is removed, the residue

redissolved in chloroform (60 ml) and the resulting solution stirred over 
copper(i) chloride (lg) to remove the remaining triphenylphosphine. The 
reaction mixture is filtered, the chloroform evaporated and the residue 
extracted with methanol (1). The methanol extract is treated with a solution 
of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine sulphate to give 1.66 g (86%) of 3,4-dimethoxy-

6.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



aromatic ketones. Further substitution in the aromatic nucleus, or the presence 
of other alkyl or aralkyl groups, or of other aromatic residues attached to the 
carbonyl carbon gives rise to predictable changes in these spectral features. 
Descriptive assignments are given in some of the preparative examples below. 

6.11.1 FRIEDEL CRAFTS-TYPE ACYLATION PROCESSES 

The reaction of a carboxylic acid chloride or anhydride with an aromatic 
hydrocarbon in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride generally gives a 
good yield of the aromatic ketone: 

ArH -I- R-COC1 -^&gt; Ar-COR -I- HC1 
Ar'H + Ar 2 -COCl ^&gt; Ar'-COAr 2 + HC1 
ArH -I- (R-CO) 2 -^&gt; Ar-COR -I- R-C0 2 H 

It should be noted that Friedel-Crafts acylation differs from Friedel-Crafts 
alkylation (see Section 6.1.1, p. 826) in one important respect in that the 
alkylation process requires relatively small (catalytic) quantities of aluminium 
chloride. With acylations, however, at least one molar equivalent of aluminium 
chloride is necessary for each carbonyl group present in the acylating agent. This 
is because aluminium chloride is capable of forming rather stable complexes 
with the carbonyl group (see formulation below). This complex formation 
therefore requires an equivalent quantity of metal halide, and hence a slight 
excess over this amount is employed in order to ensure that the free reagent may 
be present to act as the catalyst: thus 1.2 and 2.2 molar equivalents of aluminium 
chloride are generally employed for acid chlorides and acid anhydrides 
respectively. Excess of benzene or of toluene may be used as a solvent (when 
either of these substances constitutes one of the reactants), otherwise carbon 
disulphide or nitrobenzene is usually employed. Friedel-Crafts acylation is free 
of two features which complicate the alkylation reaction, namely, (i) polysubsti- 
tution and (ii) rearrangements. There is usually no difficulty in arresting the 
acylation with the introduction of a single acyl group into the aromatic nucleus 
as the acyl group deactivates the nucleus to further electrophilic attack. In the 
case of benzene homologues which may show a tendency to isomerise or 
disproportionate under the influence of aluminium chloride (see Section 6.1.1, p. 
826) preliminary mixing of the acyl and aluminium halides is recommended. 

The mechanism of the Friedel-Crafts acylation reaction, formulated below 
for reactions using acid chlorides, probably involves the acylium ion (2) as the 
reactive electrophilic species, although an electrophilic complex (1) between the 
acid chloride and aluminium chloride may also be involved.

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.11 



The use of aliphatic carboxylic acid anhydrides in place of the corresponding 
acid chlorides offers many advantages; these include: 

(a) the greater ease of obtaining the anhydrides in a state of purity, and their 
availability as commercial products (acetic, propanoic, butanoic and 
succinic anhydrides); 

(b) the handling of disagreeable acid chlorides is avoided; 

(c) the absence of any appreciable quantities of by-products and of resinous 
substances; 

id) the reaction is smooth and the yield is generally good. 

The preparations of butyrophenone, propiophenone, benzophenone and 
methyl 2-naphthyl ketone, given in Expt 6.121, provide examples of acylation 
reactions carried out under standard Friedel-Crafts conditions using the 
appropriate acid chloride as the acylating reagent. In the case of the acetylation 
of naphthalene, two isomeric acetyl derivatives are possible and the composition 
of the product is dependent upon the reaction conditions (cf. the sulphonation of 
naphthalene, Section 6.4.1, p. 873). With nitrobenzene as the solvent the product 
is largely the thermodynamically more stable 2-acetonaphthalene, whereas in 
carbon tetrachloride the 1 -isomer is formed as the kinetically controlled 
product. Also included in the cognate preparations are several acylation 
reactions of phloroglucinol which, unlike simple phenols, proceed with accept- 
able yields, together with a convenient alternative preparation of benzo- 
phenone from benzene and excess carbon tetrachloride; this latter reaction 
involves the intermediate formation of dichlorodiphenylmethane which is 
hydrolysed to the ketone. 

The use of acetic anhydride as the acylating reagent is described in the 
preparation of p-methylacetophenone (Expt 6.122), and in a range of cognate 
preparations in which the substrates are benzene derivatives possessing 
electron-releasing groups (Br, CI, OMe, Ph). In these cases the product is largely 
the para isomer. The presence of deactivating groups (CHO, CN, N0 2 ) renders 
the aromatic ring inactive towards acylation under Friedel-Crafts conditions, 
which therefore permits the use of nitrobenzene as a reaction solvent in suitable 
cases. Also included here is the acetylation of thiophene and of ferrocene. 
Electrophilic substitution in these cases proceeds with great ease and the 
catalyst is a small amount of phosphoric acid. With thiophene the most reactive 
site is the 2-position, and 2-acetylthiophene is the predominant isomer formed; 
ferrocene gives a unique mono-acetyl derivative. 

Reaction of succinic anhydride with benzene in the presence of anhydrous 
aluminium chloride (slightly over two equivalents; see above) yields 3- 
benzoylpropanoic acid. This may be reduced by the Clemmensen method in the 
presence of a solvent (toluene) immiscible with the hydrochloric acid to 4- 
phenylbutanoic acid. Cyclisation to a-tetralone (Expt 6.123) is then effected 
smoothly by treatment with hot polyphosphoric acid. This reaction sequence 
represents the first stages in the Haworth procedure for the synthesis of 
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (see Section 6.1.4, p. 839). 

Aroylation of an aromatic system by reaction with phthalic anhydride under 
Friedel-Crafts conditions yields the o-aroylbenzoic acid. These readily available 
compounds have characteristic melting points which make them useful as 
derivatives in the characterisation of aromatic hydrocarbons and of aryl halides 
(Section 9.6.3, p. 1238). 

1007 



6.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 




With benzene the product is o-benzoylbenzoic acid (Expt 6.124), and with 
toluene, o-(p-toluoyl)benzoic acid (Expt 6.132). The aroyl benzoic acids are 
important starting materials for the synthesis of quinones (Section 6.11.3, p. 
1022), into which they are cyclised using polyphosphoric acid (Expt 6.132). 

Phenolic ketones may be prepared by the Hoesch acylation reaction, which 
may be regarded as an extension of the Gattermann aldehyde synthesis (Section 
6.10.1, p. 990). The procedure involves reaction of a nitrile with a phenol (or 
phenolic ether) in the presence of zinc chloride and hydrogen chloride; best 
results are usually obtained with polyhydric phenols or their ethers, as for 
example in the preparation of phloroacetophenone (Expt 6.125). The formation 
of phenolic ketones by means of the Fries rearrangement of phenolic esters with 
aluminium chloride is discussed on p. 976.

CAUTION: All operations should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 
Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a double surface reflux condenser, 
a sealed stirrer unit and a dropping funnel protected by a calcium chloride 
guard-tube. Connect the top of the condenser to a trap for absorbing the 
hydrogen chloride evolved (Fig. 2.61). Place 60 g (0.45 mol) of anhydrous, 
finely powdered aluminium chloride (see Section 4.2.4, p. 416) and 88 g 
(100 ml) of dry benzene (CAUTION) in the flask. Start the stirrer, and add 
39.5 g (38 ml, 0.37 mol) of butanoyl chloride (Expt 5.138) slowly during about 
half-an-hour. In the early stages it may be necessary to warm the flask gently 
to initiate the reaction (hydrogen chloride is evolved) which should then 
proceed without further heating while the remainder of the acid chloride is 
added. Finally, heat the flask in a water bath at about 50 °C for 1 hour in 
order to complete the reaction. Cool and pour the reaction mixture into 
about 250 ml of water and a little crushed ice contained in a 750-ml flask; 
decomposition occurs with the evolution of heat and a dark oil (largely a 
solution of butyrophenone in benzene) separates on the surface. Stopper the 
flask and shake to complete the decomposition; if any solid remains 
undissolved, add a little concentrated hydrochloric acid to dissolve it. Pour 
the mixture into a separatory funnel, run off and discard the lower layer, wash 
the benzene with water, then with dilute sodium hydroxide solution (to 
remove the hydrogen chloride), again with water, and finally dry over 
magnesium sulphate or calcium chloride. Remove excess benzene by flash 
distillation from a boiling water bath; use the apparatus shown in Fig. 2.101 
(100-ml distilling flask). When most of the benzene has been removed,

replace the dropping funnel by a 360 °C thermometer and the water 
condenser by a short air condenser. Continue the distillation by careful 
heating over a gauze or, better, in an air bath - (CAUTION): there may be 
some benzene in the residual oil - and collect the butyrophenone at 227- 
230 °C or at 110°C/10mmHg. The yield is 25 g (51%). 

The i.r. spectrum should be recorded and the absorptions assigned using 
the spectrum of acetophenone (p. 268) as a guide. The p.m.r. spectrum 
(CDC1 3 , TMS) shows signals at S 0.95 (t, 3H, Me), 1.92 (m, 2H, CH 2 Me), 
2.82 (t, 2H, COCH2), 7.12-7.55 (m, 3H, C 3 , 4 , 5 — H), and 7.80-8.1 (m, 2H, 
C 2 , 6 — H). The multiplet at S 1.92 provides a good example of the (N + 1) 
(M + 1) rule (p. 341) for the multiplicity of protons when coupled to N and 
M non-equivalent adjacent protons. 

Cognate preparations. Propiophenone (ethyl phenyl ketone). Proceed as 
above but use 34.5 g (32 ml, 0.37 mol) of propanoyl chloride. The yield of 
propiophenone, b.p. 214-217 °C, is 30 g (60%). An improved yield is obtained 
by the following process. Add a mixture of 75 g (70.5 ml, 0.81 mol) of 
propanoyl chloride and 90 g (103 ml, 1.15 mol) of sodium-dried benzene 
(CAUTION) to a vigorously stirred suspension of 75 g (0.56 mol) of finely 
powdered anhydrous aluminium chloride in 100 ml of dry carbon disulphide 
(CAUTION: see Sections 2.3.2, p. 40 and 4.2.32, p. 411). Then introduce 
more of the aluminium chloride (about 35 g) until no further evolution of 
hydrogen chloride occurs. The yield of propiophenone, b.p. 123 °C/25 mmHg, 
is about 90 g (90%). 

Benzophenone. A. Into a 500-ml round bottomed flask place 120 ml (105 g, 
1.35 mol) of dry benzene (CAUTION) and 35 g (29 ml, 0.25 mol) of redistilled 
benzoyl chloride. Weigh out 37 g (0.275 mol) of finely powdered, anhydrous 
aluminium chloride into a dry stoppered conical flask, and add the solid, with 
frequent shaking, during 10 minutes to the contents of the flask. Fit a reflux 
condenser with a gas absorption trap attachment to the flask, and heat on a 
water bath for 3 hours or until hydrogen chloride is no longer evolved. Pour 
the contents of the flask while still warm into a mixture of 200 g of crushed ice 
and 100 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Separate the upper benzene 
layer (filter first, if necessary), wash it with 50 ml of 5 per cent aqueous sodium 
hydroxide solution, then with water, and dry with magnesium sulphate. 
Remove the benzene after filtration by flash distillation and distil the residue 
under diminished pressure through a short fractionating side-arm (Fig. 
2.108). Collect the benzophenone at 187-190 °C/15 mmHg; it solidifies to a 
white solid on cooling, m.p. 47^8 °C. The yield is 30 g (66%).

Use a four-necked 1 -litre flange flask fitted with a double surface 
condenser, a sealed stirrer unit, a thermometer and a dropping funnel 
protected by a calcium chloride guard-tube. Attach a gas absorption trap to 
the reflux condenser outlet. Place 9 1 g (0.68 mol) of powdered anhydrous 
aluminium chloride and 200 ml (319g, 2.07 mol) of dry carbon tetrachloride 
(CAUTION, p. 399) in the flask, surround the latter with an ice bath and, 
when the temperature has fallen to 10-15 °C, introduce 10 ml (9g) of sodium- 
dried benzene (CAUTION). The reaction commences immediately (hydro-

gen chloride is evolved and the temperature rises); add salt to the ice bath to 
get more efficient cooling. When the temperature commences to fall after the 
reaction has once started, add a mixture of 100 ml (97 g) of dry benzene (total 
1.37 mol) and 1 10 ml (1.14 mol) of dry carbon tetrachloride at such a rate that 
the temperature is maintained between 5 and 10 °C (1). The addition usually 
requires 1-2 hours; continue the stirring for a further 3 hours while 
maintaining the temperature at 10 °C, and then allow to stand overnight. 

Immerse the flask in ice, start the stirrer and add about 500 ml of water 
through the separatory funnel; the excess carbon tetrachloride usually 
refluxes during the addition. Distil off as much as possible of the carbon 
tetrachloride on a water bath, and then distil the mixture with steam (Fig. 
2.102) during 30 minutes to remove the residual carbon tetrachloride (2) and 
to hydrolyse the dichlorodiphenylmethane to benzophenone. Separate the 
benzophenone layer and extract the aqueous layer with 40 ml of benzene. Dry 
the combined benzene extract and benzophenone with magnesium sulphate. 
Remove the benzene by flash distillation and isolate the pure benzophenone, 
m.p. 47^18 °C, as described in A above. The yield is 105 g (85%). 

Notes. (1) Below 5 °C, the reaction is too slow; above 10 °C, appreciable amounts of 
tarry matter are formed. 

(2) About 200 ml of carbon tetrachloride are recovered; this contains some benzene, 
but may be used after drying and redistillation, in another run. 

Methyl 2-naphthyl ketone (2-acetylnaphthalene). Equip a 1-litre three-necked 
flask with a sealed mechanical stirrer unit and a pressure-equalising dropping 
funnel fitted with a calcium chloride guard-tube; stopper the third neck. Place 
64g (0.5 mol) of resublimed naphthalene and 350g (291ml) of pure 
nitrobenzene in the flask and stir until dissolved. To the homogeneous 
solution add 43.5 g (38.5 ml, 0.55 mol) of redistilled acetyl chloride from the 
dropping funnel. Cool to — 5 °C in a freezing mixture of ice and salt and 
introduce, while stirring vigorously, 73.5 g (0.55 mol) of finely powdered 
anhydrous aluminium chloride in small portions during 90 minutes; do not 
allow the temperature to rise above °C. The aluminium chloride dissolves 
and a deep green solution results. Remove the stirrer and stopper the central 
neck; into the side-necks of the flask fit respectively a drawn-out capillary 
tube and a tube leading through a filter flask trap to a water filter pump. 
Reduce the pressure to 1 5-20 mmHg; hydrogen chloride is copiously evolved 
and a vigorous ebullition occurs in the mixture. When no more gas is evolved, 
add an excess of crushed ice and separate the nitrobenzene layer. Wash the 
latter successively wtih two 100 ml portions of dilute hydrochloric acid and 
100 ml of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution. Use either of the following 
methods for isolating the pure 2-acetylnaphthalene from the accompanying 
1 -isomer (about 10%) (1). 

1. Steam distil from a 1.5-litre flask until the odour of nitrobenzene is no 
longer perceptible in the distillate (6-12 hours). Extract the cold residue with 
three 100 ml portions of ether, dry the combined extracts with magnesium 
sulphate and distil off the ether. The residue solidifies and consists of almost 
pure methyl 2-naphthyl ketone, m.p. 52 °C; the yield is 30 g (35%). Upon 
recrystallisation from glacial acetic acid, the m.p. is raised to 54 °C. 

2. Distil the dried (magnesium sulphate) nitrobenzene solution under 
reduced pressure. Nitrobenzene passes over at 95-100 °C/16 mmHg and the 



1010 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.11 



temperature rises rapidly to 1 70 °C/1 5 mmHg; collect the fraction of b.p. 1 70- 
180°C/15mmHg. Transfer while still liquid to a porcelain basin; it solidifies 
on cooling. Spread it on a porous tile to absorb the small proportion of liquid 
methyl 1-naphthyl ketone which is present: the resulting yield of crude methyl 
2-naphthyl ketone, m.p. 40-42 °C, is 50 g (59%). Two recrystallisations from 
glacial acetic acid (or from glacial acetic acid-water) give the almost pure 2- 
isomer, m.p. 53 °C. 

Note. (1) Acetylation in carbon tetrachloride solution gives the 1-isomer as the major 
component. Add 70 g (0.52 mol) of powdered dry aluminium chloride to a vigorously 
stirred mixture of 41.9g (38ml, O.53mol) of acetyl chloride and 100ml of carbon 
tetrachloride. The mixture becomes warm; cool to 20 °C and then run in slowly a 
solution of 32 g (0.25 mol) of naphthalene in 100 ml of carbon tetrachloride. Complete 
the reaction by warming to 30 °C for 30 minutes. Decompose the reaction mixture and 
work up the product, distilling the final product under reduced pressure, b.p. 
165 °C/15 mmHg. The yield is 38.5 g (90%). 

2,4,6-Trihydroxyisobutyrophenone (Phloroisobutyrophenone). Stir a mixture 
of 15g (0.12mol) of anhydrous phloroglucinol (1), 48g (0.56 mol) anhydrous 
powdered aluminium chloride and 60 ml carbon disulphide (CAUTION) for 
30 minutes in a three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping 
funnel and a double surface condenser protected by a calcium chloride guard- 
tube. Add 45 ml of nitrobenzene, stir the reaction mixture for a further 30 
minutes and then surround the flask with a water bath maintained at 60 °C. 
Add a solution of 13 g (0.1 2 mol) of 2-methylpropanoyl chloride (Expt 5.138) 
in 5 ml of nitrobenzene from the dropping funnel over a period of 30 minutes 
keeping the temperature of the water bath at 60 °C (2). After a further 30 
minutes of stirring at this temperature pour the viscous residue on to crushed 
ice, add 425 g (1.5 mol) of Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate) and 
neutralise the solution with approximately 40 per cent aqueous sodium 
hydroxide solution (3). Remove the nitrobenzene and carbon disulphide 
within a period of 20 minutes by vigorous steam distillation without allowing 
the volume of residual liquor to increase above about 700 ml (4). Filter off the 
crystals which separate from the residual solution on cooling and standing 
(usually overnight) and recrystallise twice from water to give 9.3 g (40%) of 
pure phloroisobutyrophenone hydrate, m.p. 78-80 °C; the anhydrous pro- 
duct, m.p. 138-140 °C, may be obtained by allowing the hydrate to stand in a 
vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide for a few days. 

Notes. (1) Phloroglucinol contains two molecules of water of crystallisation; these are 
removed by heating for 12 hours at 120°C. 

(2) When carried out on a larger scale the volume of hydrogen chloride gas which is 
evolved justifies the attachment of a gas adsorption trap (Fig. 2.61) to the outlet of the 
calcium chloride guard-tube. On the scale suggested in this experiment, the apparatus 
should be sited within an efficient fume cupboard and the vapours led via a tube to a 
drain to prevent corrosion of the stirrer motor. 

(3) Phloroisobutyrophenone is unstable when heated in the presence of acid; the 
addition of Rochelle salt prevents the precipitation of aluminium hydroxide when the 
free acid is neutralised with sodium hydroxide. If any precipitate does appear more 
Rochelle salt should be added; the exact amount of aqueous sodium hydroxide will 
vary with each experimental sequence; the point of neutrality is ascertained with 
universal indicator paper. 

(4) If a bench supply of steam is not available, a large steam-can heated with three 



1011 



6.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



large Bunsen burners, or with the large flame of an air-gas blow lamp may be 
employed. Two efficient double surface water condensers connected in series will be 
required to cope with the volume of steam and vapour produced and great care must 
be exercised to ensure that the outlet to the receiver vessel is suitably trapped to 
prevent the escape of the highly flammable carbon disulphide vapour. 

2,4,6-Trihydroxyvalerophenone. Use 15 g (0.12mol) of phloroglucinol, 48 g 
(0.56 mol) of anhydrous powdered aluminium chloride and 14.4 g (0.12mol) 
of valeryl chloride (Expt 5.138) with the same volumes of nitrobenzene and 
carbon disulphide and under the conditions described for phloroisobutyro- 
phenone. The yield of hydrated product, m.p. 88-90 °C (m.p. 152-154 °C, 
anhydrous), is 11.5g (42%). 

2',4',6'-Trihydroxy-2-methylbutanophenone. Use 15 g (0.12 mol) of phloro- 
glucinol, 48 g (0.56 mol) of anhydrous powdered aluminium chloride and 
14.4 g (0.1 2 mol) of 2-methylbutanoyl chloride (Expt 5.138) under the 
conditions specified above. The yield of hydrated product, m.p. 61-63 °C, is 
14.3 g (52%). The anhydrous product is hygroscopic.

Equip a 500-ml three-necked flask with a double surface condenser, a sealed 
stirrer unit and a dropping funnel protected with a calcium chloride guard- 
tube. Connect the top of the condenser to a trap for absorbing the hydrogen 
chloride evolved (Fig. 2.61). Place 75 g (0.56 mol) of anhydrous, finely 
powdered aluminium chloride (see Section 4.2.4, p. 416) and 120g (140ml, 
1.30 mol) of pure dry toluene (Section 4.1.3, p. 398) in the flask and cool the 
latter in a bath of ice-water. Add 26 g (24 ml, 0.25 mol) of redistilled acetic 
anhydride during half an hour while the contents of the flask are thoroughly 
stirred; much heat is evolved in the reaction. Heat on a boiling water bath for 
about 30 minutes (or until the evolution of hydrogen chloride almost ceases) 
to complete the reaction, cool and pour the contents of the flask into a 
mixture of 1 50 g of crushed ice and 1 50 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
contained in a beaker or flask. Stir or shake until all the aluminium salts are 
dissolved. Transfer the mixture to a separatory funnel, add 25-30 ml of ether, 
shake and separate the upper (largely toluene) layer. Extract the aqueous 
layer with 25 ml of ether and add this to the toluene solution. Wash the 
combined toluene and ether extracts with 50 ml of 10 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution (or until the washings remain alkaline), then with water, 
separate the organic layer and dry it with magnesium sulphate or anhydrous 
calcium chloride. Remove the ether and toluene by distillation under 
atmospheric pressure and isolate the p-methylacetophenone by distillation at 
reduced pressure through a short fractionating column. The product (29 g, 
86%) has b.p. 93-94 °C/7 mmHg. The i.r. and p.m.r. spectra of p-methyl- 
acetophenone and the compounds of the following cognate preparations 
should be recorded and interpreted using the spectra of acetophenone as a 
guide (pp. 268 and 329). 

Cognate preparations. p-Bromoacetophenone. In a 1 -litre three-necked flask,

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.11 



equipped as above, place 78.5 g (52.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of dry bromobenzene (Expt 
6.23), 200ml of dry carbon disulphide (CAUTION: see Section 2.3.2, p. 40) 
and 150g of finely powdered anhydrous aluminium chloride. Stir the mixture 
and heat on a water bath until gentle refluxing commences; add 51 g (47.5 ml, 
0.5 mol) of redistilled acetic anhydride slowly through the dropping funnel 
(30-60 minutes). Maintain gentle refluxing during the addition of the acetic 
anhydride and for 1 hour afterwards. Distil off most of the carbon disulphide 
on a water bath, allow the reaction mixture to cool somewhat and while still 
warm pour it slowly with stirring into a mixture of 500 g of crushed ice and 
300 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Decompose any residue in the flask 
and add it to the main product. Extract with 150 and 100 ml portions of ether, 
wash the combined extracts twice with water, once with 10 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution and twice with water. Dry the extract with magnesium 
sulphate or anhydrous calcium chloride, remove the ether and distil the 
residue under reduced pressure. The p-bromoacetophenone boils at 
130°C/15mmHg or at 117°C/7mmHg and a 3°C fraction should be 
collected; it crystallises to a white solid, m.p. 50 °C. The yield is 75 g (75%). 
The b.p. under atmospheric pressure has been given as 
255.5 °C/736mmHg. 

p-Chloroacetophenone. Use 56 g (51ml, 0.5 mol) of chlorobenzene and 
proceed as for p-bromoacetophenone. The yield of product, b.p. 124- 
126°C/24mmHg, m.p. 20-21 °C, is 60 g (78%). The b.p. under atmospheric 
pressure is 237 °C. 

p-Methoxyacetophenone. Use 54 g (54.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of anisole and proceed 
as for p-bromoacetophenone. The yield of p-methoxyacetophenone, b.p. 
139°C/15mmHg, is 70g (93%). The b.p. under atmospheric pressure is 
265 °C. 

p-Phenylacetophenone. In a 1 -litre three-necked flask provided with a 
dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser, place 77 g 
(0.5 mol) of biphenyl, 150g (1.125 mol) of finely powdered anhydrous 
aluminium chloride and 350 ml of anhydrous carbon disulphide 
(CAUTION). Charge the dropping funnel with 51 g (47.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of pure 
acetic anhydride and close the mouth of the funnel with a calcium chloride 
guard-tube. Heat the mixture on a water bath until gentle refluxing 
commences, and add the acetic anhydride during 1 hour; the addition 
product makes its appearance as a curdy mass when about three-quarters of 
the anhydride has been added. Reflux the reaction mixture gently for a 
further hour. Allow to cool and pour the reaction product slowly and with 
stirring on to crushed ice to which hydrochloric acid has been added. Filter 
the precipitated p-phenylacetophenone on a Buchner funnel, wash repeatedly 
with water until free from acid, dry, and distil under reduced pressure. There 
is usually a small fraction of low boiling point; the main product passes over 
at 196-210 °C/ 1 8 mmHg and solidifies on cooling. The yield of crude p- 
phenylacetophenone, m.p. 118 °C, is 85 g (86%). Upon recrystallisation from 
rectified spirit, the m.p. is raised to 120-121 °C; the recovery is about 80 per 
cent.

Place 84 g (79 ml, 1 mol) of thiophene and 51 g (47.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of acetic 
anhydride in a 500-ml three-necked flask, fitted with a thermometer, 
mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser. Heat the stirred solution to 70- 
75 °C, remove the source of heat and add 5g (4 ml) of 85-89 per cent 
orthophosphoric acid. An exothermic reaction occurs after 2-3 minutes and 
the temperature may rise to 90 °C; immerse the flask in a bath of cold water to 
control the reaction. When the boiling subsides (c. 5 minutes), reflux the 
mixture for 2 hours. Add 125 ml of water, stir for 5 minutes, transfer the cold 
reaction mixture to a separatory funnel, remove the water layer, wash with 
two 50 ml portions of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution and dry over 
magnesium sulphate. Distil the orange-red liquid through a short fractionat- 
ing column (Fig. 2.108) at atmospheric pressure and thus recover 38 g of 
unchanged thiophene at 83-84 °C. Distil the residue under reduced pressure 
and collect the 2-acetylthiophene at 89-90 °C/10mmHg; this solidifies on 
cooling in ice, m.p. 10 °C. The yield is 44 g (70%). 

Acetylferrocene 51 [acetylcyclopentadienyl(cyclopentadienyl)iron(n)]. Using a 
Pasteur pipette add 85 per cent phosphoric acid (1ml) to a mixture of 
ferrocene (Expt 6.15) (1.5 g) and acetic anhydride (5 ml) contained in a small 
round-bottomed flask with constant shaking. Protect the mixture by the 
attachment of a calcium chloride drying tube, and heat it on a water bath for 
10 minutes. Pour the mixture on to ice (20 g) contained in a 500 ml beaker. 
Add water to melt the remaining ice, and then neutralise the mixture by 
adding solid sodium hydrogen carbonate until carbon dioxide is no longer 
evolved. Cool the mixture in an ice bath for 1 5 minutes and filter on a No. 2 
or No. 3 sintered glass crucible. Wash the collected solid with water to 
remove any white inorganic salts. Dry the orange-brown product by drawing 
air through it for at least 15 minutes. The product consists mainly of the 
acetyl derivative and unreacted ferrocene. 

Purification by column chromatography. Push a small wad of glass wool to the 
bottom of a dry 50 ml burette with the aid of a glass rod; pour in enough acid- 
washed sand to give a 5 mm layer. Prepare a solvent mixture of ethyl acetate 
(20 ml) and light petroleum (180 ml, b.p. 60-80 °C). Make a slurry of column 
grade silica gel with a little of the prepared solvent and transfer to the burette. 
Repeat this operation until the silica gel level reaches the 20 ml mark, and 
then drain the solvent to just coincide with this level. Mix the above crude 
acetyl derivative (0.4 g) with a little silica gel and slurry with a small portion 
of solvent mixture. Transfer the slurry to the burette using a small amount of 
additional solvent, and again lower the solvent level to the silica gel layer. 
Add another 5 mm-layer of sand. Fill the burette with solvent taking care not 
to disturb the upper sand layer. Elute the products at the rate of 1-2 drops 
per second when the difference in colour of ferrocene and its acetyl derivative 
will enable them to be collected as separate fractions. Evaporate each 
collected fraction to dryness and confirm their identity by melting point

determinations, and by recording their i.r. spectra in chloroform solution, 
and their p.m.r. spectra. The p.m.r. spectrum of ferrocene exhibits a single

absorptions at 3 2.39 (s, 3H, Me), 4.19 (s, 5H, unsubstituted ring H's), 4.48

3-Benzoylpropanoic acid. Place 175 g (2.25 mol) of sodium-dried benzene 
(CAUTION) and 34 g (0.34 mol) of succinic anhydride (Expt 5.141) in a 1- 
litre three-necked flask equipped with a sealed stirrer unit and two efficient 
reflux condensers, the tops of which are connected through a Y-junction to a 
single efficient gas absorption device (Fig. 2.61). Stir the mixture and add 
100 g (0.75 mol) of powdered, anhydrous aluminium chloride all at once. The 
reaction usually starts immediately - hydrogen chloride is evolved and the 
mixture becomes hot; if there is no apparent reaction, warm gently. Heat in 
an oil bath to gentle refluxing, with continued stirring, for half an hour. Allow 
to cool, immerse the flask in a bath of cold water and slowly add 1 50 ml of 
water from a separatory funnel inserted into the top of one of the condensers. 
Introduce 50 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and separate the benzene 
by steam distillation (Fig. 2.102). Transfer the hot mixture to a 600-ml beaker; 
the 3-benzoylpropanoic acid separates as a colourless oil, which soon 
solidifies. Cool in ice, filter off the acid at the pump and wash with 100 ml of 
cold dilute hydrochloric acid (1:3 by volume) and then with 100 ml of cold 
water. Dissolve the crude acid in a solution of 40 g of anhydrous sodium 
carbonate in 250 ml of water by boiling for 10-15 minutes; filter the solution 
with suction to remove the small amount of aluminium hydroxide and wash 
with two 25 ml portions of hot water. Treat the hot filtrate with 2g of 
decolourising carbon, stir for 5 minutes and filter at the pump through a 
preheated Buchner funnel. Transfer the hot filtrate to a 1 -litre beaker, cool to 
about 50 °C and cautiously acidify with 65-70 ml of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid. Cool to °C in a freezing mixture of ice and salt, filter, wash 
thoroughly with cold water, dry for 12 hours upon filter papers, and then to 
constant weight at 45-50 °C. The yield of practically pure 3-benzoylpro- 
panoic acid, m.p. 115 °C, is 57 g. 

4-Phenylbutanoic acid. Prepare amalgamated zinc from 120g of zinc wool 
contained in a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask (Section 4.2.80, p. 467), decant 
the liquid as completely as possible and add in the following order 75 ml of 
water, 180 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 100 ml of pure toluene and

condenser connected to a gas absorption device (Fig. 2.61), and boil the 
reaction mixture vigorously for 30 hours; add three or four 50 ml portions of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid at approximately six-hour intervals during 
the refluxing period in order to maintain the concentration of the acid. Allow 
to cool to room temperature and separate the two layers. Dilute the aqueous 
portion with about 200 ml of water and extract with three 75 ml portions of 
ether. Combine the toluene layer with the ether extracts, wash with water and 
dry over anhydrous magnesium or calcium sulphate. Remove the solvents by 
distillation under diminished pressure using a rotary evaporator and distil 
the residue under reduced pressure (Fig. 2.108). Collect the 4-phenylbutanoic 
acid at 178-181 °C/19mmHg; this solidifies on cooling to a colourless solid 
(40 g, 89%) and melts at 47^8 °C. 

a-Tetralone. Heat 120 g of polyphosphoric acid (Section 4.2.58, p. 458) to 
90 °C in a 1-litre beaker on a steam bath. Liquefy 33 g (0.20 mol) of 4- 
phenylbutanoic acid by heating to 70 °C and add this in one portion to the 
polyphosphoric acid with manual stirring. Remove the beaker from the steam 
bath and continue stirring for 3 minutes; the temperature should remain at 
about 90 °C. Then add 100 g more of polyphosphoric acid and warm on a 
steam bath with vigorous stirring for 4 minutes. Cool to 60 °C, add 300 g of 
crushed ice and stir until the polyphosphoric acid is completely hydrolysed 
and a yellow oil has separated. Extract the mixture with three 1 50 ml portions 
of ether and wash the combined extracts with water, with 5 per cent aqueous 
sodium hydroxide solution and then with water until the washings are 
neutral. Dry the ethereal solution over magnesium sulphate and remove the 
ether on a rotary evaporator. Distil the residue under reduced pressure

Equip a 750-ml three-necked flask with a sealed mechanical stirrer and a 
reflux condenser connected with a gas absorption trap (Fig. 2.61); insert a 
stopper in the third neck. Place 25 g (0.1 7 mol) of pure phthalic anhydride 
[see Expt 5.220, Note (1)] and 100 ml (1.16 mol) of sodium-dried benzene 
(CAUTION) in the flask; start the stirrer and add 50 g (0.375 mol) of 
powdered anhydrous aluminium chloride from a stoppered test tube in four 
portions or, alternatively, use the device shown in Fig. 2.57. If the reaction 
does not commence after the addition of the first 12 g of aluminium chloride, 
warm for a few seconds on a water bath. When all the aluminium chloride has 
been added and the evolution of hydrogen chloride slackens, warm on a 
water bath and ultimately reflux the mixture until the evolution of gas 
practically ceases. Cool the flask, add crushed ice slowly until the dark mass is 
completely decomposed and then run in concentrated hydrochloric acid (35- 
40 ml) until the solution clears. Steam distil (Fig. 2.102) to remove the excess

of benzene; the residue in the flask, when cooled in ice, largely solidifies and 
consists of crude o-benzoyl benzoic acid. Filter off the solid product and wash 
it well with 74 ml of cold water; dissolve the solid in 150 ml of warm 10 per 
cent sodium carbonate solution. Treat the solution of the sodium salt with 2 g 
of decolourising charcoal, boil for 2 minutes and filter through a preheated 
Buchner funnel. Place the filtrate in a 1 -litre beaker, cool in ice and cautiously 
acidify with concentrated hydrochloric acid while stirring well (c. 20ml are 
required). The acid separates as an oil but it soon crystallises on stirring and 
cooling. Filter when ice cold, and wash with a little water. Dry in the air upon 
filter paper; the product, which is somewhat efflorescent, consists largely of 
the monohydrate, m.p. 94 °C. 

To prepare pure anhydrous o-benzoylbenzoic acid, dissolve the air-dried 
(or the moist) product in about 175 ml of toluene contained in a 500-ml 
round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and heat on a water 
bath. Transfer the toluene solution to a separatory funnel, run off any water 
present and dry with magnesium sulphate. Concentrate the toluene solution 
to about half its volume and add light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) to the hot 
solution until a slight turbidity is produced. Allow to cool spontaneously to 
room temperature, then cool in ice to about 5 °C, collect the crystals and dry. 
The yield of pure, anhydrous o-benzoylbenzoic acid, m.p. 128 °C, is 32 g (84%).

6.11.2 SYNTHESIS OF AROMATIC KETONES FROM CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATES 

Grignard reagents derived from aryl bromides are readily prepared and may be 
converted into organocadmium compounds by treatment with cadmium 
chloride (cf. Section 5.8.4, p. 616). Reaction of an organocadmium with a 
carboxylic acid chloride constitutes a convenient synthesis of aryl alkyl ketones. 

2ArBr + 2Mg &gt; 2ArMgBr ^&gt; Ar 2 Cd + 2MgClBr 

Ar 2 Cd + 2R-COC1 »• 2Ar-COR + CdCl 2 

The reaction is illustrated by the formation of propiophenone from diphenyl- 
cadmium and propanoyl chloride (Expt 6.126). Better yields are obtained by 
carrying out the synthesis in this manner rather than attempting the alternative 
combination of diethylcadmium with benzoyl chloride. Alternatively an alkyl- 
lithium 'cuprate' could be used with an aromatic acid chloride (p. 616). 

Several examples of the synthesis of aryl alkyl ketones by the thermal 
decarboxylation of mixtures of carboxylic acids over heated metal salts are 
included under the preparation of aliphatic ketones (Expt 5.93). In this section 
the preparation of dibenzyl ketone (Expt 6.127) by the pyrolysis of the barium 
salt of phenylacetic acid, which proceeds in good yield, is included as a further 
example of this general type of synthesis.

CAUTION: All operations should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard. 
Prepare a solution of diphenylcadmium in 110 ml of dry benzene 
(CAUTION) using 4.9 g (0.2 mol) of magnesium, 31.4g (0.2 mol) of bromo- 
benzene and 19.5 g (0.106 mol) of anhydrous cadmium chloride following the 
experimental procedure given for the preparation of dibutylcadmium (Expt 
5.94). Cool the solution to 10 °C, and add during 3 minutes a solution of 
14.8 g (0. 1 6 mol) of propanoyl chloride (b.p. 78-79 °C) in 30 ml of dry benzene 
(CAUTION); use external cooling with an ice bath to prevent the tempera- 
ture rising above 40 °C. Stir the mixture for 2 hours at 25-35 °C. Add crushed 
ice (c. 200 g) and sufficient dilute (1m) sulphuric acid to give a clear aqueous 
layer. Separate the benzene from the aqueous layer and extract the latter with 
two 20 ml portions of benzene. Wash the combined extracts successively with 
50 ml portions of water, 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution, water and 
saturated sodium chloride solution. Dry over anhydrous sodium sulphate, 
remove the benzene by flash distillation and distil the residue under reduced

Place 40 g (0. 1 27 mol) of barium hydroxide octahydrate with 60 ml of water in 
a 250-ml round-bottomed flask and add 34 g (0.25 mol) of phenylacetic acid 
(Expt 5.128) slowly with swirling; warm the mixture until a clear solution is 
obtained. Evaporate the solution on a water bath under reduced pressure 
using a rotary evaporator, to yield a pasty mass of moist barium phenylace- 
tate. Fit the flask with a Claisen still-head carrying a gas inlet tube for 
nitrogen extending well into the flask and a 360 °C thermometer, and attach 
an air condenser with a receiver flask connected by means of an adapter with 
side arm. Lag the Claisen head with suitable insulating tape. Pass a slow 
stream of nitrogen into the flask and heat the latter gently in an air bath. 
When the residual water has been expelled, change the receiver. Now heat 
more strongly; dibenzyl ketone passes over at 320-325 °C as a pale yellow oil 
(24 g) which solidifies on standing. Redistil under reduced pressure and 
collect pure dibenzyl ketone at 210 °C/35 mmHg as a colourless oil (21 g, 
80%); this completely crystallises on standing and has m.p. 33-34 °C. 

6.11.3 QUINONES 

The simplest quinones are o- and p-benzoquinone [(3) and (4) respectively]. 
This quinonoid structural feature is widespread in naturally occurring com- 
pounds isolated from moulds, fungi, lichens, plants and insects, 52 which include 
not only substituted benzoquinones but also substituted polycyclic quinones 
[i.e. the substituted analogues of, for example, 1,2-naphthoquinone (5), 9,10- 
anthraquinone (6), and 9,10-phenanthraquinone (7)].

(6) 

These quinonoid systems play a vital role in biosynthetic routes, are found as 
structural units in antibiotics and pigments, and are found in compounds having 
antihaemorrhagic activity (e.g. the Vitamin K group). In the laboratory 
substituted quinones are used as oxidising agents, and as starting materials for 

1019 



6.11 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the synthesis of polycyclic compounds by virtue of their dienophilic reactivity in 
the Diels-Alder reaction (Section 7.6). 

An excellent survey of the various methods of synthesis is available 53 ; this 
section includes some of the illustrative methods of synthesis of the simpler 
analogues. These methods may be considered under the following headings: (a) 
the oxidation of hydrocarbons; (b) the oxidation of phenols and the oxidative 
coupling of phenols; (c) the oxidation of dihydric phenols and aminophenols; 
and (d) the cyclisation of aroylbenzoic acids. 



OXIDATION OF HYDROCARBONS 

Quinones of the more reactive, polycyclic, aromatic systems can usually be 
obtained by direct oxidation, which is best carried out with chromium(vi) 
compounds under acidic conditions. In this way 1,4-naphthoquinone, 9,10- 
anthraquinone and 9,10-phenanthraquinone are prepared from naphthalene, 
anthracene and phenanthrene respectively (Expt 6.128). Also included in this 
section is the reduction of anthraquinone with tin and acid to give anthrone, 
probably by the sequence of steps formulated below.

HO-pH 

OXIDATION OF PHENOLS AND THE OXIDATIVE COUPLING OF 
PHENOLS 

The classical and the most useful laboratory method for the preparation of 
quinones is the oxidation of monohydric phenols with the radical reagent, 
potassium nitrosodisulphonate [(K0 3 S) 2 NO] (Fremy's salt) (the Teuber 
reaction).** Details for the conversion of 3,4-dimethylphenol into 3,4-dimethyl- 
1,2-benzoquinone may be regarded as typical 55 ; the probable mechanistic 
pathway is formulated below. 




1020 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.11 



The ortho coupling of phenoxy radicals is noted in the formation of l,l'-bi-2- 
naphthol from 2-naphthol by oxidation with iron(m) chloride (Expt 6.10). In the 
case of hindered 2,6-dialkylphenols, a very wide range of oxidants have been 
found to be variously successful in effecting para coupling; further oxidation 
then occurs to give an extended quinone. 




Oxidation of hindered phenols bearing additionally a para methyl group leads 
to substituted stilbenequinones. These may be reduced in the presence of zinc 
and acid to the corresponding dihydroxystilbenes.

The reagents which have been used here to illustrate these interesting 
reactions are periodic acid for the oxidation of 2,6-di-t-butylphenol, 56 and a 
Celite-supported silver carbonate reagent for the oxidation of 2,6-dimethyl 
phenol, and 2,4,6-trimethylphenol 57 (Expt 6.129). 

OXIDATION OF DIHYDRIC PHENOLS AND AMINOPHENOLS 

p-Benzoquinone is conveniently prepared in the laboratory by the oxidation of 
hydroquinone (Expt 6.130) with either chromium trioxide in acetic acid or with 
sodium chlorate in the presence of vanadium pentoxide as a catalyst. 

p-Benzoquinone and hydroquinone form a well-defined molecular complex 
known as quinhydrone. This complex, in the form of dark green crystals having 
a glistening metallic lustre, is conveniently prepared (Expt 6.130) by the partial 
oxidation of hydroquinone with a solution of iron alum. 

The behaviour of p-benzoquinone on reaction with acetic anhydride in the 
presence of sulphuric acid is of interest. The eventual product is 1,2,4- 
triacetoxybenzene (the Thiele acetylation), which is formed by the following

The formation of o-quinones by the above oxidative methods is less reliable 
since the ortho quinonoid system is more susceptible to attack by electrophilic 
and nucleophilic species; mild conditions are therefore essential. The use of the 
silver carbonate/Celite reagent noted above for phenol coupling reactions is 
particularly suitable; the conditions are those described in Expt 6.129, and they 
have been applied to the oxidation of catechol, 4-methylcatechol, 4-t- 
butylcatechol, and 3,5-di-t-butylcatechol to yield the corresponding o-quinones 
in almost quantitative yield. 

A fairly general procedure for the synthesis of o- and p-quinones consists in 
coupling a phenol with a diazonium salt and reducing the resulting azo 
compound to an aminophenol with sodium dithionite. Mild oxidation with, for 
example, iron(m) chloride results in the formation of the corresponding quinone 
(e.g. the preparation of 1,2-naphthoquinone described and formulated in Expt 
6.131). 

CYCLISATION OF AROYLBENZOIC ACIDS 

The aroylation of an aromatic system by reaction with phthalic anhydride 
under Friedel-Crafts conditions is described in Section 6.11.1, p. 1006. The 
cyclisation of the derived o-aroylbenzoic acid with polyphosphoric acid is a 
convenient route to substituted anthraquinones. The reaction is illustrated by 
the formation of 2-methylanthraquinone from o-(p-toluoyl)benzoic acid (Expt 
6.132).

AROMATIC COMPOUNOS 6.11 



thermometer, mechanical stirrer and 1-litre dropping funnel. Surround the 
flask by a mixture of ice and salt and, when the temperature has fallen to °C, 
add a solution of 64 g (0.5 mol) of pure naphthalene in 600 ml of glacial acetic 
acid, with constant stirring, over a period of 2-3 hours while maintaining the 
internal temperature at 10-15 °C. Continue the stirring overnight, during 
which time the reaction mixture and bath attain room temperature. Allow the 
dark green solution to stand for 3 days and stir occasionally. Pour the 
reaction mixture into 5-6 litres of water, collect the crude naphthoquinone by 
suction filtration, wash with 200 ml of water and dry in a desiccator. 
Recrystallise from 500ml of petroleum ether (b.p. 80-100 °C). The yield of 
pure 1,4-naphthoquinone, m.p. 124-125 °C, is 17 g (22%). 

Cognate preparations. 9,10-Anthraquinone. Place 5.0 g of powdered 
anthracene and 50 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 250-ml, two-necked round- 
bottomed flask with a reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. Mix the flask 
contents thoroughly by a swirling action and heat the mixture to reflux when 
most of the anthracene dissolves. Dissolve 10.0 g of chromium trioxide in 7- 
8 ml of water, add 25 ml of glacial acetic acid and pour the well-stirred 
mixture into the dropping funnel. Remove the heat source from the flask and 
add slowly the oxidising reagent at such a rate that the mixture continues to 
reflux (7-10 minutes); then reflux for a further 10 minutes when all the 
anthracene will have reacted completely. Cool the solution and pour into 
250 ml of cold water. Stir the mixture vigorously, filter off the precipitated 
anthraquinone under gentle suction, wash it thoroughly on the filter with hot 
water, then with 50 ml of hot 1 m sodium hydroxide solution and finally with 
much cold water; drain well. Dry the anthraquinone by pressing it between 
several sheets of filter paper and leave it overnight in a desiccator over 
calcium chloride. The yield is 5.5 g (94%). 

Purify the anthraquinone by either of the following methods: 

1. Recrystallise the crude product from boiling glacial acetic acid with the aid 
of decolourising charcoal, wash the resulting crystals on the Buchner 
funnel with a little cold rectified spirit and dry in the air. 

2. Sublime the dry solid using the procedure described in Section 2.21. The 
purified anthraquinone is obtained as yellow crystals having m.p. 273 °C. 

Reduction of anthraquinone to anthrone. Place 52 g (0.25 mol) of anthraquin- 
one, 50 g (0.42 mol) of granulated tin and 375 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 
1 -litre round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Heat the contents of 
the flask to boiling and slowly run in 125 ml of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid from a dropping funnel down the condenser over a period of 2 hours. By 
this time all the anthraquinone should have passed into solution; if not, add 
more tin and hydrochloric acid. Filter the liquid with suction through a 
sintered glass funnel, and add 50 ml of water. Cool the solution to about 10 °C 
when the anthrone will crystallise out. Filter the crystals at the pump on a 
Buchner funnel and wash with water. Dry upon filter-paper or upon a porous 
tile: the yield of crude anthrone, m.p. about 153 °C, is 40 g (82%). Recrystallise 
from a 3:1 mixture of benzene and light petroleum, b.p. 60-80 °C (10-12 ml 
per gram); this gives 30 g (61%) of pure anthrone, m.p. 155 °C. 

Phenanthraquinone. Add 20 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid cautiously and 
with stirring to 40 ml of water contained in a 250-ml beaker. Heat to 90-95 °C

on a water bath (it may be necessary to place the beaker in the boiling water 
bath), add 2.0 g (0.01 lmol) of purified phenanthrene, and then 12.0 g of 
potassium dichromate in 0.5 g quantities until a vigorous reaction sets in: the 
latter usually occurs by the time about half of the oxidising agent has been 
added. Remove the beaker from the water bath - the temperature of the 
mixture will be 1 10-1 15 °C - and continue adding the potassium dichromate 
in small portions to maintain the reaction. Do not allow the temperature to 
fall below 85 °C as the reaction will cease: if necessary, heat on a water bath. 
When the addition is completed, heat on a boiling water bath for a further 30 
minutes. 

Cool the beaker in a bath of cold water and add 150 ml of cold water. 
Filter off the crude phenanthraquinone with suction and wash it with water 
until free from chromium salts. Suspend the solid in 20 ml of rectified spirit 
and add, with stirring, 20 ml of saturated sodium metabisulphite solution. 
Break up the lumps of the addition product with a glass rod and allow to 
stand, with frequent stirring, for 10 minutes. Add 150 ml of water to dissolve 
the addition product and filter with suction. Reject the precipitate which 
consists of the impurities present in the phenanthrene. Add saturated sodium 
carbonate solution to the filtrate until the bisulphite addition product is 
completely decomposed: allow the precipitate to settle for 1 minute, then add 
a few drops of sodium carbonate solution and note whether any further 
precipitation occurs. Stir the precipitate for 2-3 minutes, filter with suction, 
wash with three 20 ml portions of water and drain well. Dry the product 
between filter papers and then in a desiccator over calcium chloride. The yield 
of phenanthraquinone, m.p. 206 °C, is 1.4 g (60%). The product may be 
recrystallised from glacial acetic acid (about 20 ml), but the m.p. is unaffected.

2,6-Di-t-butylphenol (2.06 g, lOmmol) is dissolved in dimethylformamide

product partially crystallises out by this time. After 5-10 minutes at room 
temperature, the reaction mixture is diluted with 50 per cent aqueous 
methanol (8-10 ml), and the product isolated by filtration and washed with 
cold methanol. The resultant is recrystallised from aqueous acetone to give 
the product (94%) as brown-red needles, m.p. 245-247 °C. 

Cognate preparation. General procedure using Celite-supported silver carbo- 
nate. 51 Preparation of reagent. The Celite is purified by washing it 
successively with methanol containing 10 per cent concentrated hydrochloric 
acid and then with distilled water until neutral; it is finally dried at 120 °C. 
Purified Celite (30 g) is added to a mechanically stirred solution of silver 
nitrate (34 g, 200mmol) in distilled water (200 ml). A solution of sodium 
carbonate decahydrate (30 g, 105mmol) (or 21 g, 210mmol of potassium

hydrogen carbonate) in distilled water (300 ml) is then added slowly to the 
resulting homogeneous suspension. When the addition is complete, stirring is 
continued for a further 10 minutes. The yellow-green precipitate which is 
formed is then filtered off and finally dried in a rotary evaporator over a 
period of several hours. The silver carbonate/Celite reagent contains about 
1 mmol of silver carbonate in 0.57 g. 

Oxidation procedure. The reagent is freed from residual water by azeotropic 
distillation with benzene (CAUTION). The compound to be oxidised is then 
added and refiuxed in benzene (c. 200ml for 0.5-2.0 g of compound). At the 
end of the reaction (determined by t.l.c. monitoring), the solid phase is filtered 
off and the solvent evaporated. The product is usually highly pure and 
recrystallisation is unnecessary. With 2,6-dimethylphenol the molar ratio of 
phenol to silver carbonate is 1 :4.4, and the reaction time is half an hour; in 
this case 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyldiphenoquinone is obtained in 98 per cent yield 
and has m.p. 217-218 °C. With 2,4,6-trimethylphenol, using the same molar 
ratio of phenol to oxidant, and a reaction time of 2 hours, 3,3',5,5'- 
tetramethylstilbenequinone is obtained in 93 per cent yield and having m.p. 
227-228 °C. 

Reduction of a stilbenequinone. A solution of 3,3'5,5'-tetramethylstilbene- 
quinone (0.05 g) in acetic acid (100 ml) is shaken with zinc dust (4 g) for about 
1 hour. The colourless mixture is filtered and the filtrate neutralised with 
sodium hydrogen carbonate. Extraction with ether and evaporation of 
solvent gives 3,3',5,5'-tetramethyl-4,4'-dihydroxystilbene as yellow crystals, 
m.p. 237-240 °C; p.m.r. (Me 2 CO-d 6 , TMS) 5 2.24 (s, 12H), 3.00 (s, 2H), 6.87

Method 1. Cool a solution of 33 g (0.33 mol) of hydroquinone in 1 50 ml of 
60 per cent acetic acid contained in a 600-ml beaker to below 5 °C in an ice 
bath. Dissolve 42 g (0.42 mol) of chromium trioxide in 70 ml of water, and add 
30 ml of glacial acetic acid. By means of a separatory funnel with bent stem 
and supported over the beaker, add the chromium trioxide solution to the 
mechanically stirred hydroquinone solution at such a rate that the tempera- 
ture does not rise above 10 °C; the addition takes about 2 hours. Filter the 
mixture at once and wash the quinone several times with 10 ml portions of 
ice-cold water. Spread the material upon filter paper until dry, but no longer 
or the quinone will be lost through sublimation. The yield of quinone (a 
bright yellow crystalline solid), m.p. 115 °C, is 21 g (66%); it darkens when 
exposed to light. 

Impure quinone may be purified by placing it in a distilling flask attached 
to a condenser and passing a rapid current of steam into the flask: the 
quinone sublimes and collects in the receiver. It is separated from the water 
by filtration and dried; the m.p. is 1 16 °C. The vapour has a penetrating odour 
and attacks the eyes.

Method 2. In a 1-litre round- bottomed flask, provided with a mechanical 
stirrer, place 0.5 g of vanadium pentoxide (catalyst), 500 ml of 2 per cent 
sulphuric acid, 55 g (0.5 mol) of hydroquinone and 30 g of sodium chlorate. 
Stir the mixture vigorously for about 4 hours. Greenish-black quinhydrone is 
first formed and this is converted into yellow quinone; the temperature of the 
mixture rises to about 40 °C (do not allow it to exceed this temperature). Cool 
the flask in running water, filter the mixture at the pump and wash it with 
50 ml of cold water. Dry the quinone upon filter paper in the air (see Method 
1) or in a desiccator over anhydrous calcium chloride. The yield is 45 g (83%), 
m.p. 111-112°C. The crude quinone may be purified by steam distillation as 
in Method 1, or by recrystallisation from boiling light petroleum, b.p. 100- 
120 °C (12 ml per gram): the resulting pure, bright yellow quinone has m.p. 
115°C and the recovery is about 95 per cent. 

Conversion of hydroquinone into quinhydrone. Dissolve 100 g of iron alum 
[iron(m) ammonium sulphate] in 300 ml of water at 65 °C. Pour the solution, 
with stirring, into a solution of 25 g (0.228 mol) of hydroquinone in 100 ml of

0.25 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. The temperature of the mixture rises 
to 40-50 °C and is kept within this range by regulating the rate of addition of 
the quinone. When the addition is complete allow the solution to cool to 
about 25 °C and pour into 150 ml of cold water. Collect the precipitated 
triacetate and recrystallise it from about 50 ml of rectified spirit; the yield is

containing a solution of 0.25 g of tin(n) chloride in 5 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid diluted with 100 ml of water; upon stirring the aminonaph- 
thol dissolves and a small amount of insoluble matter remains. The function 
of the tin(n) chloride is as an antioxidant, preventing the readily oxidisable 
aminonaphthol hydrochloride from undergoing appreciable change. Stir the 
solution for 5 minutes with 2 g of decolourising carbon, and filter at the 
pump. If crystalline material should separate at any stage, dissolve it by 
warming and by the addition of a little water if necessary. Transfer the clear 
solution to a beaker, add 25 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and warm 
until the solid dissolves. Cool to °C, filter the almost colourless crystals of 
the aminonaphthol hydrochloride with suction and wash with 25 ml of dilute 
hydrochloric acid (1:4 by volume). From this point all operations must be 
carried out rapidly. In the meantime, prepare the oxidising solution by 
dissolving 30 g (0.1 1 mol) of crystallised iron(m) chloride in a mixture of 10 ml 
of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 25 ml of water by heating, cool to 
room temperature by adding c. 30 g of crushed ice and filter the solution at 
the pump. Wash the crystalline l-amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride into a 
600-ml beaker with water, add 150 ml of water and a few drops of 
concentrated hydrochloric acid and dissolve the precipitated solid by stirring 
and warming to about 35 °C. If necessary, filter rapidly by suction from a 
trace of residue, transfer to a 500-ml round-bottomed flask, add the iron(m) 
chloride solution all at once while shaking the flask vigorously. The quinone 
separates rapidly as a voluminous micro-crystalline yellow precipitate. Filter 
on a Buchner funnel and wash it thoroughly with water at 30 °C to remove all 
traces of acid. Dry the product upon filter paper in an atmosphere free from 
acid fumes. The yield of 1,2-naphthoquinone, which melts with decompo- 
sition at 145-147 °C, is 7g (78%).

the corresponding o-aroylbenzoic acid. The air-dried product consists largely 
of the monohydrate; this becomes anhydrous upon drying at 100 °C and

6.12.1 THE CANNIZZARO REACTION 

Aromatic aldehydes (and other aldehydes in which a-hydrogen atoms are 
absent, e.g. formaldehyde and trimethylacetaldehyde) under the influence of 
strong aqueous or alcoholic alkali undergo simultaneous oxidation and 
reduction yielding the alcohol and corresponding carboxylate salt. Thus: 

KOH 

2Ar-CHO &gt; Ar-CH 2 OH + Ar-COf K® 

This dismutation or disproportionation reaction is known as the Cannizzaro 
reaction. The mechanism of the reaction involves the production of the anion (1) 
which may transfer a hydride ion to a carbonyl carbon atom in another 
aldehyde molecule. The reaction sequence is completed by a proton transfer to 
yield the carboxylate anion and the alcohol.

The reaction is illustrated here by the conversion of benzaldehyde into benzoic 
acid and benzyl alcohol (Expt 6.133) and by a similar converson of furfural into 
furfuryl alcohol and furoic acid (cognate preparation in Expt 6.133). 

A preparatively more useful form of this reaction is the crossed Cannizzaro 
reaction which ensues when a mixture of an aromatic aldehyde and formalde- 
hyde is allowed to react under the influence of strong base (e.g. the preparation of 
p-methyl benzyl alcohol, Expt 6.134). A substantial proportion of the aromatic 
aldehyde is reduced to the corresponding alcohol while the formaldehyde is 

1028 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS S.12 



oxidised to formate. This is a reflection of the fact that nucleophilic attack of the 
hydroxide ion takes place preferentially at the more electrophilic carbonyl 
carbon atom in formaldehyde.

Ph-CHO + Ph-CHO -^&gt; Ph-CH 2 OH + Ph-COfK® 

Dissolve 29 g of potassium hydroxide in 27 ml of water contained in a beaker 
or conical flask, and cool the solution to about 20 °C in ice-water. Pour the 
solution into a 250-ml reagent bottle, and add 32 g (30 ml, 0.3 mol) of pure 
benzaldehyde (1); cork the bottle securely and shake the mixture vigorously 
until it has been converted into a thick emulsion. Allow the mixture to stand 
overnight or for 24 hours in the stoppered bottle. Add just sufficient water 
(about 105 ml) to dissolve the potassium benzoate. Pour the liquid into a 
separatory funnel, rinse out the bottle with about 30 ml of ether and add this 
ether to the solution in the funnel. Shake the solution in order to thoroughly 
extract the benzyl alcohol with the ether, separate the lower aqueous solution 
and carry out two further extractions each with about 25 ml of ether. Save the 
aqueous solution. Combine the ether extracts and distil the ether from a water 
bath (rotary evaporator) until the volume is about 25 ml. Cool and shake the 
ether solution twice with 5 ml portions of saturated sodium metabisulphite 
solution in order to remove any benzaldehyde which may be present. 
Separate the ethereal solution, wash it with 10 ml of 10 per cent sodium 
carbonate solution (to ensure complete removal of the bisulphite), then with 
10 ml of water, and dry with anhydrous magnesium sulphate or anhydrous 
potassium carbonate. Remove the ether (Fig. 2.98; 50-ml distilling flask) on a 
water bath, and distil the residual liquid from an air bath; replace the water 
condenser by an air condenser or empty the water completely from the 
condenser jacket. Collect the benzyl alcohol at 204-207 °C (the pure 
compound boils at 205.5 °C). The yield is 13 g (86.5%). 

The p.m.r. and 13 C-n.m.r. spectra of benzyl alcohol are given in Figs 3.65 
and 3.53 respectively. The i.r. spectrum (thin film) shows absorptions at 
c. 3300 cm" 1 (broad, OH stretching), c. 3050 and 2950 cm" 1 (C AR — H and 
C A l — H, stretching), 1600, 1590 and 1500 cm" 1 (ring breathing vibrations), 
c. 690 and 735 cm" l (C AR — H, out-of-plane vibrations), and 2000-1600 cm" l 
(summation bands). 

Pour the aqueous solution remaining from the ether extraction with 
stirring into a mixture of 80 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 80 ml of 
water and about lOOg of crushed ice. Filter the precipitated benzoic acid at 
the pump, wash it with a little cold water, drain and recrystallise from boiling 
water. The yield of benzoic acid (colourless crystals), m.p. 121 °C, is 13.5 g 
(79%) (2).

6.12 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The i.r. spectrum (KBr disc) should be recorded and interpreted; the p.rar. 
spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) should also be recorded and the two groups of 
aromatic protons assigned, bearing in mind the electron-withdrawing nature 
of the carboxyl group. 

Notes. (1) The benzaldehyde should be free from benzoic acid; it may be purified by 
washing with aqueous 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution, drying over anhydrous 
magnesium sulphate, adding a few crystals of hydroquinone or catechol, and distilling 
under reduced pressure in a stream of nitrogen. Benzaldehyde has a b.p. 
79°C/25mmHg or 62°C/10mmHg. 

(2) The reaction may alternatively be carried out by boiling the benzaldehyde 
vigorously under reflux for 2 hours with a solution of 20 g of potassium hydroxide in 
90 ml of water, and then working up the cooled reaction mixture as described above. 
Reaction is normally complete under these conditions; the extent of the reaction may 
be determined by subjecting the crude ether extract, before the latter is washed with 
bisulphite solution, to g.l.c. analysis on a 1.5 m column of Chromosorb W with 10 per 
cent of Carbowax as the stationary phase, at 156 °C with a nitrogen flow rate of 40ml 
per minute. The retention times of benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol are approxi- 
mately 2.7 and 9.7 minutes respectively.

Place 200g (172.5ml, 2.08 mol) of redistilled furfural (1) in a 1-litre beaker 
provided with a mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath. Start the 
stirrer and, when the temperature has fallen to 5-8 °C, add a solution of 50 g 
(1.2 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml of water from a separatory funnel at 
such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 
20 °C (20-25 minutes); continue the stirring for a further 1 hour. Much 
sodium furoate separates during the reaction. Allow to cool to room 
temperature, and add just enough water to dissolve the precipitate (about 
65 ml). Extract the solution at least five times with 60 ml portions of ether in 
order to remove the furfuryl alcohol: the best results are obtained by the use 
of the continuous extraction apparatus (charged with 350ml of ether) 
depicted in Fig. 2.92. Keep the aqueous layer. Dry the ethereal extract with a 
little magnesium sulphate, and remove the ether on a rotary evaporator. 
Distil the residue under reduced pressure (Fig. 2.108) and collect the furfuryl 
alcohol (a very pale yellow liquid) at 75-77°C/15mmHg; the yield is 65 g 
(64%). Because of the tendency to undergo polymerisation, add about 1 per 
cent of its weight of urea as stabiliser if the furfuryl alcohol is to be stored. 
Treat the aqueous solution, containing the sodium furoate, with 40 per 
cent sulphuric acid until it is acid to Congo red paper, and cool. Filter off the 
furoic acid, contaminated with a little sodium hydrogen sulphate, at the 
pump. Dissolve it in 240 ml of boiling water, add 12 g of decolourising carbon, 
boil the solution for about 45 minutes, filter hot and cool the filtrate with 
stirring to 16-20 °C; below 16 °C, sodium hydrogen sulphate also separates. 
Filter off the furoic acid with suction, and dry. The yield is 65 g (55%), m.p. 
123-124 °C. It may be further purified either by recrystallisation from carbon 
tetrachloride to which a little decolourising carbon is added or by distillation 
under reduced pressure, b.p. 142-144 °C/20mmHg; the resulting pure acid 
softens at 125 °C and is completely melted at 132°C.

The i.r. spectra of 2-furaldehyde, furfuryl alcohol (thin films) and 2-furoic 
acid (KBr disc) should be recorded and the absorption bands of the 
functional groups assigned. The p.m.r. spectra are excellent examples of 
proton coupling in the 2-substituted furan nucleus. In the case of the alcohol 
and acid the J 3j5 coupling constant is negligible and J 4 , 5 &lt; J 3-4 . Bearing 
these facts in mind the signals should be assigned from the following data; 2- 
furaldehyde (CC1 4 , TMS) 3 6.52 (d of d, 1H), 7.11 (d, 1H), 7.61 (d, 1H) and 
9.63 (s, 1H); 2-furoic acid (Me 2 CO, TMS) 3 6.71 (d of d, 1H), 7.32 (d, 1H), 
7.89 (d, 1H) and 10.51 (s, 1H). The lesser electron-withdrawing nature of the 
hydroxymethyl group in furfuryl alcohol results in the C 3 and the C 4 protons 
having very similar chemical shift values; in the spectrum (CC1 4 , TMS) the 
signals thus appear at 3 3.32 (s, 1H, disappears on treatment with D 2 0), 4.50 
(s, 2H), 6.29 (m, 2H), and 7.38 (d, exhibiting small coupling, 1H). 

Note. (1) Furfural (2-furaldehyde) is best purified by distillation under reduced 
pressure: b.p. 54-55°C/17mmHg.

Equip a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a reflux condenser, a sealed 
mechanical stirrer and a thermometer; the bulb of the thermometer should 
reach almost to the bottom of the flask. Place 170g of commercial potassium 
hydroxide pellets (about 85% KOH, c. 2.6 mol) and 250 ml of methanol in the 
flask and set the stirrer in motion. Most of the alkali dissolves in a few 
minutes and the temperature rises considerably. Immerse the flask in a large 
cold-water bath and, when the temperature has fallen to 60-65 °C, add down 
the condenser a mixture of 1 20 g ( 1 1 8 ml, 1 mol) of p-tolualdehyde and 1 00 ml 
(c. 1.3 mol) of formalin at such a rate (during about 15 minutes) that the 
internal temperature remains at 60-70 °C: maintain the internal temperature 
at 60-70 °C for a further 3 hours. Replace the reflux condenser by a condenser 
set for downward distillation, and distil off the methanol, while stirring, until 
the temperature reaches about 100 °C. Add 300 ml of water to the warm 
residue, cool the mixture and separate the resulting two layers at once; if the 
upper layer is allowed to stand, it will solidify. Extract the aqueous layer with 
four 50 ml portions of toluene. Wash the combined oil and toluene extracts 
with five 25 ml portions of water, extract the combined washings with 25 ml of 
toluene and add the toluene layer to the washed extract. Dry the toluene 
solution by shaking with a few grams of magnesium sulphate, distil off the 
toluene and finally distil under reduced pressure (Fig. 2.108) and collect the p- 
methylbenzyl alcohol at 116-1 18 °C/20mmHg (1). The product solidifies in 
the receiver to a mass (HOg) of oily crystals, m.p. 54-55 °C. Recrystallise 
from an equal weight of technical heptane (b.p. 90-100°C); 88 g (72%) of pure 
p-methylbenzyl alcohol, m.p. 61 °C, are obtained. The p.m.r. spectrum 
(CDC1 3 , TMS) should be recorded and interpreted.

A retrosynthetic analysis of a,/J-unsaturated ketones leading to various methods 
of synthesis is outlined in Section 5.18.2, p. 798. These methods are equally 
applicable to aromatic aldehydes. Aromatic aldehydes condense with aliphatic 
or mixed alkyl aryl ketones in the presence of aqueous alkali to form a,/?- 
unsaturated ketones (the Claisen-Schmidt reaction).

The first step is a condensation of the aldol type (see Section 5.18.2, p. 799) 
involving the nucleophilic addition of the carbanion derived from the methyl 
ketone to the carbonyl-carbon of the aromatic aldehyde. Dehydration of the 
hydroxyketone to form the conjugated unsaturated carbonyl compound occurs 
spontaneously.

Experiment 6.135 describes the preparation of a range of a,/J-unsaturated

acetophenone. The conversion of this latter compound into /J-phenylpropio- 
phenone is readily achieved by hydrogenation at atmospheric pressure over an 
active platinum catalyst. 

The formation of co-nitrostyrenes (illustrated in Expt 6.136) by reaction of 
nitroalkanes with aromatic aldehydes in the presence of aqueous alkali may be 
classified with reactions of the Claisen-Schmidt type.

A further example of the above reaction type is provided by the condensation 
between an aromatic aldehyde and an ester (the Claisen reaction, e.g. the 
synthesis of ethyl cinnamate, Expt 6.137), which requires a more powerfully 
basic catalyst (e.g. sodium ethoxide) to effect conversion of the ester into the 
corresponding anion.

A. Place 42.5 g (40.5 ml, 0.4 mol) of pure benzaldehyde (Expt 6.133) and 63.5 g 
(80 ml, 1.1 mol) of pure acetone in a 250-ml flask equipped with a mechanical 
stirrer. Immerse the reaction vessel in a bath of cold water and add slowly 
(during about 30 minutes) from a dropping funnel 10 ml of 10 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution: adjust the rate of addition so that the tempera- 
ture remains between 25 and 30 °C. Stir the mixture at room temperature for 
a further 2 hours; alternatively, securely stopper the flask and shake 
mechanically for the same period. Render the mixture just acid to litmus 
paper by the addition of dilute hydrochloric acid. Transfer to a separatory 
funnel. Remove the upper organic layer, extract the lower aqueous layer with 
20 ml of toluene and add the extract to the yellow upper layer. Wash the latter 
with 20 ml of water, and dry with a little magnesium sulphate, and transfer to 
a distillation assembly incorporating a Claisen still-head and a short 
fractionating side-arm (compare Fig. 2.108). Remove the toluene by distilla- 
tion at atmospheric pressure and distil the residue under diminished 
pressure. The benzylideneacetone distils at 133-143 °C/16mmHg (or at 120- 
130°C/7mmHg or at 150-160 °C/25mmHg) and solidifies to a crystalline 
mass on standing, m.p. 38-39 °C; the yield is 45 g (77%). This is pure enough 
for most practical purposes, but may be further purified by redistillation (b.p. 
137-142 °C/16mmHg) or by recrystallisation from light petroleum (b.p. 40- 
60 °C): the pure benzylideneacetone melts at 42 °C. The residue in the 
distilling flask contains some dibenzylideneacetone. 

The i.r. spectrum of benzylideneacetone should be recorded and the 
absorption bands assigned appropriately. The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , 
TMS) shows signals at 5 2.32 (s, 3H, Me), 6.67 (d, lH,=CH-CO), 7.44 (d, 1H, 
Ph-CH=) and 7.21-7.62 (m, 5H, C AR — H); careful inspection of the coupling 
constants observable with the signal at S 6.67 enables the signal at S 7.44 to be 
differentiated from those of the aromatic protons. 

B. In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask place a cold solution of 25 g of 
sodium hydroxide in 250 ml of water and 200 ml of ethanol ( 1 ); equip the flask 
with a mechanical stirrer and surround it with a bath of water. Maintain the 
temperature of the solution at 20-25 °C, stir vigorously and add one-half of a 
previously prepared mixture of 26.5 g (25.5 ml, 0.25 mol) of pure benzalde- 
hyde and 7.3 g (9.3 ml, 0.125 mol) of acetone. A flocculent precipitate forms in 
2-3 minutes. After 15 minutes add the remainder of the benzaldehyde-acetone 
mixture. Continue the stirring for a further 30 minutes. Filter at the pump and 
wash with cold water to eliminate the alkali as completely as possible. Dry 
the solid at room temperature upon filter paper to constant weight; 27 g (93%) 
of crude dibenzylideneacetone, m.p. 105-107 °C, are obtained. Recrystallise 
from hot ethyl acetate (2.5 ml per gram) or from hot rectified spirit. The 
recovery of pure dibenzylideneacetone, m.p. 122 °C, is about 80 per cent.

Ph-CHO + Me-N0 2 ±^&gt; Ph-CH=CH-N0 2 

Equip a 1500-ml three-necked flask with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer 
and a dropping funnel. Place 61 g (54 ml, 1 mol) of nitromethane (1), 106 g 
(101 ml, 1 mol) of purified benzaldehyde (Expt 6.133) and 200 ml of methanol 
in the flask and cool it with a mixture of ice and salt to about — 10 °C. 
Dissolve 42 g of sodium hydroxide in 40-50 ml of water, cool and dilute to 
100 ml with ice and water; place this cold solution in the dropping funnel. 
Add the sodium hydroxide solution, with vigorous stirring, to the nitrometh- 
ane mixture at such a rate that the temperature is held at 10-15 °C. Introduce 
the first few ml cautiously since, after a short induction period, the 
temperature may rise to 30 °C or higher; check the rise in temperature, if 
necessary, by adding a little crushed ice to the reaction mixture. A bulky 
white precipitate forms; if the mixture becomes so thick that stirring is 
difficult, add about 10 ml of methanol. After standing for about 15 minutes, 
add 700 ml of ice-water containing crushed ice; the temperature should be 
below 5 °C. Run the resulting cold solution immediately from a dropping 
funnel and with stirring into 500 ml of 4 m hydrochloric acid contained in a 3- 
litre flask; adjust the rate of addition so that the stream just fails to break into 
drops. A pale yellow crystalline precipitate separates almost as soon as the 
alkaline solution mixes with the acid. The solid settles to the bottom of the 
vessel when the stirrer is stopped. Decant most of the cloudy liquid layer, 
filter the residue by suction and wash it with water until free from chlorides. 
Transfer the solid to a beaker immersed in hot water; two layers form and on 
cooling again, the lower layer of nitrostyrene solidifies; pour off the upper 
water layer. Dissolve the crude nitrostyrene in 85 ml of hot ethanol. 
(CAUTION: nitrostyrene vapours are irritating to the nose and eyes, and the 
skin of the face is sensitive to the solid.) Filter through a hotwater funnel and 
cool until crystallisation is complete. The yield of pure co-nitrostyrene, m.p. 
57-58 °C, is 125 g (85%). 

Note. (1) The commercial material may be redistilled and the fraction having b.p. 
100-102 °C collected.

Prepare powdered (or 'molecular') sodium from 14.5 g (0.63 mol) of clean 
sodium and 150-200 ml of sodium-dried xylene contained in a 1 -litre three- 
necked flask (Section 4.2.6, p. 417) fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux 
condenser. When cold, pour off the xylene as completely as possible, and then 
add 220 g (240 ml, 2.5 mol) ethyl acetate (Section 4.1.24, p. 409) containing 
2 ml of absolute ethanol (1). Cool the flask rapidly to 0°C and add 53 g 
(51 ml, 0.5 mol) of pure benzaldehyde (Expt 6. 133) slowly (during 90 minutes) 
from a dropping funnel while the mixture is stirred. Keep the temperature 
between and 5 °C; do not allow it to rise above 10 °C otherwise a poor yield 
will be obtained. The reaction commences as soon as the benzaldehyde is 
added, as is indicated by the production of a reddish substance on the 
particles of sodium. Continue the stirring until practically all the sodium has 
reacted (about 1 hour after all the benzaldehyde has been introduced). Then 
add 45 ml of glacial acetic acid followed by an equal volume of water 
(CAUTION: some sodium may be present). Separate the layer of ester, 
extract the aqueous layer with 25 ml of ethyl acetate, wash the combined 
organic layers with 1 50 ml of 1 : 1 hydrochloric acid and dry with magnesium 
sulphate or sodium sulphate. Distil off the ethyl acetate on a water bath. 
Distil the residue under diminished pressure (Fig. 2.108). Collect the ethyl 
cinnamate (a colourless liquid) at 126-131 °C/6 mmHg; the yield is 65 g (74%) 

(2). 

The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 ) should be recorded and the signals which 
are apparent at 5 1.30 (t, 3H), 4.80 (q, 2H), 6.33 (d, 1H), 7.73 (d, 1H), and 7.2- 
7.6 (m, 5H) assigned. 

Notes. (1) A little ethanol (c. 1%) is required to start the reaction; the yield is 
consistently lower in its absence. 

(2) Ethyl cinnamate may also be prepared by the esterification of cinnamic acid (cf. 
methyl cinnamate, Expt 6.163). The pure compound boils at 127 °C/6 mmHg. 



6.12.3 THE PERKIN AND DOEBNER REACTIONS 

A retrosynthetic analysis of a,/J-unsaturated acids leading to various methods of 
synthesis is outlined in Section 5.18.3, p. 804. The following methods are 
particularly applicable to aromatic aldehydes. 

The condensation of an aromatic aldehyde with an acid anhydride in the 

1036 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.12 



presence of the sodium or potassium salt of the acid corresponding to the 
anhydride to yield an a,/?-unsaturated acid is known as the Perkin reaction. 

\Aa.cC\ ©IMa® 

Ar-CHO + (Me-CO) 2 : &gt; Ar-CH=CH-C0 2 H + Me-C0 2 H 

The mechanism of the reaction, which is of the aldol type, involves the carbonyl 
group of the aldehyde and an active methylene group of the anhydride; the 
function of the basic catalyst (acetate anion, Me*C0 2 e , or triethylamine, Et 3 N) 
is to form an anion by removal of a proton from the anhydride:

&gt; 




The standard procedure is illustrated by the preparation of cinnamic acid and 
furylacrylic acid (Expt 6.138). The cinnamic acid obtained is the more stable (£)- 
isomer. It may be readily reduced to the saturated acid (3-phenylpropanoic acid) 
and two procedures are described. Catalytic hydrogenation is a convenient 
method, but the conjugated double bond may also be reduced with, for example, 
sodium amalgam in the presence of alkali. 

A modified Perkin procedure is illustrated in the synthesis of a-phenyl- 
cinnamic acid in which benzaldehyde is condensed with phenylacetic acid in the 
presence of acetic anhydride and triethylamine. Presumably equilibria are set up 
which result in the formation of either a mixed anhydride, phenylacetic acetic 
anhydride or the symmetrical phenylacetic anhydride.

Coumarin is formed from acetic anhydride and salicylaldehyde in the 
presence of triethylamine as the base catalyst. It is the lactone of the (Z)-form of 
o-hydroxycinnamic acid; some of the (£)-isomer in the form of its acetyl 
derivative (o-acetoxycinnamic acid) is also obtained (Expt 6.138). 

Arylacrylic acids may alternatively be conveniently prepared by the Doebner 
modification of the Knoevenagel reaction. The Knoevenagel reaction embraces a 
number of base-catalysed condensations between a carbonyl compound and a 
component having an active methylene group (see also Section 5.11.6, p. 681). 
Examples of the Doebner modification, which usually involves the reaction of 
an aldehyde with malonic acid in the presence of pyridine or possibly a little 
piperidine, are given in Expt 6.139. The reaction mechanism is of the aldol type 
and involves the formation of a hydroxymalonic acid and then an a,/J- 
unsaturated malonic acid, which undergoes decarboxylation at the temperature 
of refluxing pyridine.

Place 21 g (20 ml, 0.2 mol) of pure benzaldehyde (1), 30 g (28 ml, 0.29 mol) of 
acetic anhydride and 12 g (0.122 mol) of freshly fused and finely powdered 
potassium acetate (2) in a dry, 250-ml round-bottomed flask fitted with an air 
condenser carrying a calcium chloride guard-tube. Mix well and heat the 
reaction mixture in an oil bath at 160 °C for 1 hour and at 170-180 °C for 3 
hours. Pour the mixture while still hot (80-100 °C) into about 100 ml of water 
contained in a 1-litre round-bottomed flask which has previously been fitted 
for steam distillation (Fig. 2.102); rinse the reaction flask with a little hot 
water. Now add with vigorous shaking a saturated aqueous solution of 
sodium carbonate (3) until a drop of the liquid withdrawn on the end of a 
glass rod turns red litmus a distinct blue. Steam distil the solution until all the 
unchanged benzaldehyde is removed and the distillate is clear. Cool the 
residual solution and filter at the pump from resinous by-products. Acidify 
the filtrate by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid slowly and with 
vigorous stirring until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases. When cold, 
filter the cinnamic acid at the pump, wash with cold water and drain well. 
Recrystallise either from hot water or from a mixture of 3 volumes of water 
and 1 volume of rectified spirit. The yield of dry cinnamic acid (colourless 
crystals), m.p. 133 °C, is 18 g (62%). 

The p.rar. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) shows signals at 3 6.41 
(d, 1H,=CH-C0 2 ), 7.73 (d, 1H, Ph-CH), 7.17-7.69 (m, 5H, C AR — H) and 1 1.90

77 (103 - C 2 H 2 ) and 51 (77 - C 2 H 2 ). 

Notes. (1) The benzaldehyde must be free from benzoic acid; it may be purified as 
detailed in Expt 6.133. 

(2) Fused potassium acetate should be freshly prepared following the procedure 
described for sodium acetate (Section 4.2.69, p. 464). It may, however, be replaced by 
an equivalent quantity of freshly fused sodium acetate, but the reaction is slower and a 
further 3-4 hours heating is necessary. 

(3) Sodium hydroxide solution cannot be used at this stage since it may produce 
benzoic acid by the Cannizzaro reaction (Expt 6.133) from any unchanged 
benzaldehyde. If, however, the reaction mixture is diluted with 3-4 volumes of water, 
steam distilled to remove the unreacted benzaldehyde, the residue may then be 
rendered alkaline with sodium hydroxide solution. A few grams of decolourising 
carbon are added, the mixture boiled for several minutes, and filtered through a fluted 
filter paper. Upon acidifying carefully with concentrated hydrochloric acid, cinnamic 
acid is precipitated. This is collected, washed and purified as above.

until hydrogen uptake ceases. Record the volume of hydrogen required, filter 
off the platinum and evaporate the filtrate on a rotary evaporator. The 
resulting oil solidifies on cooling to a colourless solid, m.p. 47-48 °C; the yield 
is 14.3 g (95%). Upon recrystallisation from light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) 
pure hydrocinnamic acid, m.p. 48-49 °C, is obtained. 

Method B. Dissolve 20 g (0.135 mol) of cinnamic acid in 145 ml of 
approximately 1 m sodium hydroxide solution contained in a 500-ml two- 
necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and situated within a fume 
cupboard. Add 350 g (0.38 mol) of 2.5 per cent sodium amalgam (Section 
4.2.70, p. 464) gradually during 1 hour through the open side-neck while the 
mixture is well stirred. When hydrogen is no longer evolved, separate the 
mercury and wash it with water: add the washings to the solution and acidify 
the whole with dilute hydrochloric acid (1:1). Hydrocinnamic acid is 
precipitated, at first in the form of an oil, which solidifies on cooling and 
rubbing with a glass rod. Filter at the pump and recrystallise as in Method A. 
The yield of hydrocinnamic acid, m.p. 46-48 °C, is 17 g (85%). The p.m.r.

stirrer and a long air condenser. Heat the flask, with stirring, in an oil bath at 
150°C (bath temperature) for 4 hours: when the temperature approaches 
145-150 °C, a vigorous exothermic reaction sets in and must be controlled by 
the application of cold wet towels (or cloths) to the flask in order to avoid too 
vigorous boiling. Allow to cool slightly, transfer the reaction mixture to a 
1 -litre round-bottomed flask and add 600 ml of water: use part of this to rinse 
out the reaction flask. Boil the mixture with 6 g of decolourising charcoal for 
10 minutes, and filter hot through a preheated Buchner funnel into a 
preheated filter flask. Transfer the hot filtrate to a beaker, add dilute 
hydrochloric acid (1:1) until it is acid to Congo red paper and cool to about

thoroughly with the wash liquid before applying suction. Transfer the solid to 
a small beaker and triturate with 8 ml of ethanol, refilter, suck dry and repeat 
the trituration procedure with a further 8-ml portion of ethanol. Dissolve the 
filtered solid in 20 ml of hot toluene, treat with 1 g of charcoal and filter the 
hot solution (fume cupboard). Add 35 ml of hot ethanol to the filtrate, boil 
and cool the solution in ice with shaking. Filter the purified diene, wash with 
5 ml of cold ethanol and dry at 50 °C; the final product has m.p. 153 °C. The 
yield is 3.5 g (23%). 

6.12.5 THE BENZOIN CONDENSATION 

Aromatic aldehydes when treated with an alkali metal cyanide, usually in 
aqueous solution, undergo condensation to the a-hydroxyketone or benzoin. 
The examples in Expt 6.142 are benzoin and furoin. 

2Ar-CHO NaCNaq &gt; Ar-CH(OH)-CO-Ar 

By use of 1 mol each of two different aldehydes, an unsymmetrical or mixed 
benzoin is obtained (for example, the formation of 4-methoxybenzoin).

The reaction depends upon the catalytic influence of the cyanide ion and the 
mechanism may be represented in the following way.

Oxidation of the a-hydroxyketone with concentrated nitric acid, or by 
catalytic amounts of copper(n) salts in acetic acid solution which are 
regenerated continuously by ammonium nitrate, yields the diketone (e.g. benzil 
and furil, Expt 6.143). 

Ar-CH(OH)-CO-Ar -^U Ar-CO-CO-Ar 

a-Diketones (Ar-CO-CO-Ar) upon refluxing with aqueous-alcoholic potas- 
sium hydroxide undergo the benzilic acid rearrangement and are converted into 
the salt of a benzilic acid (Expt 6.144).

The mechanism involves nucleophilic attack of the hydroxide ion at a 
carbonyl carbon atom to yield the oxyanion (1) which undergoes a 1,2- 
nucleophilic shift of an aryl group as shown. Proton transfer completes the 
reaction sequence.

Direct conversion of a benzoin into the corresponding benzilic acid may be 
accomplished conveniently and in good yield by reaction with alkaline bromate 
solution at 85-90 °C (see Expt 6.144, Method 2).

In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask place 65 ml of rectified spirit, 50 g (47.5 ml, 
0.47 mol) of pure benzaldehyde (1) and a solution of 5 g of sodium cyanide 
(96-98%) [CAUTION: see Expt 5.157, Note (7)] in 50 ml of water. Attach a 
reflux condenser (preferably of the double surface type) and boil the mixture 
gently for half an hour (2). Cool the contents of the flask (preferably in an ice 
bath). Filter the crude benzoin, wash it with cold water, drain well (3) and 
dry. The yield of crude benzoin, which is white or pale yellow in colour, is 45 g 
(90%). 

Recrystallise 5.0 g from about 40 ml of hot rectified (or industrial) spirit; 
upon cooling, 4.5 g of pure benzoin (a white, crystalline solid, m.p. 137°C) 
separates. Reserve the remainder of the preparation for benzil and benzilic 
acid (Expts 6.143 and 6.144 respectively). 

Notes. (1) For the purification of commercial benzaldehyde, see Expt 6.133. 

(2) The reaction sometimes takes place with considerable violence and material may 
be lost through the condenser unless a large flask (e.g. at least of the size given) is 
employed. 

(3) The filtrate contains sodium cyanide, and should be washed down the sink with a 
liberal quantity of water; see also Expt 5.157, Note (1).

In a 1 -litre three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux 
condenser and a separatory funnel, place 400ml of water, 200g (172.5ml, 
2.08 mol) of freshly distilled furfural (see Expt 6.133) and 150 ml of rectified 
spirit. Heat the reaction mixture to boiling, remove the source of heat and, 
when the liquid has just ceased to boil, add with stirring a solution of 10 g of 
potassium cyanide (CAUTION) in 30 ml of water from the separatory funnel 
as rapidly as the vigour of the reaction permits. When the ebullition subsides 
(exothermic reaction), heat to boiling for a further 5 minutes. Acidify the 
reaction mixture with glacial acetic acid (use litmus paper) and allow to cool 
overnight, preferably in an ice chest or a refrigerator. Filter off the dark 
crystals at the pump, wash with cold water and then with cold methanol to 
remove as much of the tar (colouring matter) as possible. Recrystallise from

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.12 



methanol with the addition of about 10 g of decolourising carbon. The yield 
of furoin, m.p. 135-136 °C, is 75 g (37.5%). If the m.p. is slightly low, another 
recrystallisation from toluene-ethanol will give satisfactory results. 

4-Methoxybenzoin. Dissolve 25 g of potassium cyanide (CAUTION) in 
175 ml of water in a 1500-ml round-bottomed flask, and add 136g (121.5 ml, 
1 mol) of redistilled p-methoxybenzaldehyde (anisaldehyde), 108 g (103 ml, 
1.02 mol) of redistilled benzaldehyde and 350 ml of 95 per cent ethanol. 
Reflux the mixture (which becomes homogeneous at the boiling temperature) 
for 90 minutes. Remove all the unreacted aldehydes and the ethanol by steam 
distillation. Decant the water and set the residue aside to crystallise. Press the 
product as free as possible from oily material on a suction funnel and wash it 
with a little ethanol. Recrystallise the crude product (c. 125 g) by dissolving it 
in hot ethanol and allowing to crystallise slowly. The p-methoxybenzoin 
separates out first in large clumps of long needles, while the little benzoin 
present crystallises in small compact balls of needles. With a little experience 
it is possible to filter off a good yield of the former before the appearance of 
the benzoin. The yield of 4-methoxy benzoin is about 55 g (23%). Recrystallise 
again until the m.p. is 105-106 °C. 

Experiment 6.143 BENZIL 

Ph-CH(OH)-COPh -^U Ph-COCO-Ph 

Method 1. Place 20 g (0.094 mol) of crude benzoin (Expt 6.142) and 100 ml of 
concentrated nitric acid in a 250-ml round-bottomed flask. Heat on a boiling 
water bath (in the fume cupboard) with occasional shaking until the 
evolution of oxides of nitrogen has ceased (about 1.5 hours). Pour the 
reaction mixture into 300-400 ml of cold water contained in a beaker, stir 
well until the oil crystallises completely as a yellow solid. Filter the crude 
benzil at the pump, and wash it thoroughly with water to remove the nitric 
acid. Recrystallise from ethanol or rectified spirit (about 2.5 ml per gram). 
The yield of pure benzil, m.p. 94-96 °C, is 19 g. 

Method 2. Place 0.2 g of copper(n) acetate, 10 g (0.1 25 mol) of ammonium 
nitrate, 21.2 g (0.1 mol) of benzoin and 70 ml of an 80 per cent v/v aqueous 
acetic acid solution in a 250-ml flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Heat the 
mixture with occasional shaking (1). When solution occurs, a vigorous 
evolution of nitrogen is observed. Reflux for 90 minutes, cool the solution, 
seed the solution with a crystal of benzil (2) and allow to stand for 1 hour. 
Filter at the pump and keep the mother-liquor (3): wash well with water and 
dry (preferably in an oven at 60 °C). The yield of benzil, m.p. 94-95 °C, is 19 g 
(90%); the m.p. is unaffected by recrystallisation from alcohol or from carbon 
tetrachloride (2 ml per gram). Dilution of the mother-liquor with the aqueous 
washings gives a further 1.0 g of benzil. 

Notes. (1) For large-scale preparations use a three-necked flask equipped with two 
reflux condensers and a sealed mechanical stirrer. 

(2) Stirring or vigorous shaking also induces crystallisation. 

(3) The mother-liquor should not be concentrated as an explosion may result. 

Cognate preparation. Furil. Proceed exactly as for Method 2, using 19.2 g

Method 1. In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask, place a solution of 35 g of 
potassium hydroxide in 70 ml of water, then add 90 ml of rectified spirit and 
35 g (0.167 mol) of recrystallised benzil (Expt 6.143). A deep bluish-black 
solution is produced. Fit a reflux condenser to the flask and heat the mixture 
on a boiling water bath for 10-15 minutes. Pour the contents of the flask into 
a porcelain dish and allow to cool, preferably overnight. The potassium salt 
of benzilic acid crystallises out. Filter off the crystals at the pump and wash 
with a little ice-cold alcohol. Dissolve the potassium salt in about 350 ml of 
water, and add 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid from a burette slowly 
and with stirring. The precipitate thus produced is coloured red-brown and is 
somewhat sticky. Filter this off; the filtrate should be nearly colourless. 
Continue the addition of hydrochloric acid with stirring until the solution is 
acid to Congo red paper. Filter off the benzilic acid with suction, wash it 
thoroughly with cold water until free from chlorides and allow to dry. The 
yield of crude benzilic acid, which is usually light pink or yellow in colour, is 
30 g (79%). Purify the product either by recrystallisation from hot benzene 
(about 6 ml per gram) or from hot water with the use of a little decolourising 
carbon. The coloured and sticky material obtained by the first precipitation 
may be recrystallised from hot water with the addition of a little decolouris- 
ing carbon, and a further 1-2 g obtained. Pure benzilic acid has m.p. 150°C. 

Method 2. Prepare a solution of 50g of sodium hydroxide and 1 1.5 g of 
sodium bromate (or 12.5 g of potassium bromate) in 90 ml of water in an 
evaporating dish. Add 42 g (0.2 mol) of benzoin ( 1 ) in portions to this solution 
while stirring (preferably with a mechanical stirrer) and heating on a water 
bath at 85-90 °C (2). Add small quantities of water from time to time to 
prevent the mixture becoming too thick; about 80 ml of water are required. 
Continue the heating and stirring until a test portion is completely or almost 
completely soluble in water; this usually requires 3-4 hours. Dilute the 
mixture with 400 ml of water and allow to stand, preferably overnight. Filter 
off the solid or oil impurity (benzhydrol). Set aside 5 ml of the filtrate (3) and 
to the bulk add dilute sulphuric acid (4) slowly and with stirring to a point 
just short of the liberation of bromine; about 130 ml are required. If the end- 
point is overstepped, add the 5 ml of the filtrate which was set aside and then 
sufficient sulphuric acid to the end-point. Filter off the product at the pump, 
wash it well with water and dry. The benzilic acid weighs 39 g (85%) and has a 
m.p. of 149-1 50 °C, i.e. is practically pure. If desired, it may be recrystallised 
from benzene, or from water. 

Notes. (1) The crude benzoin (Expt 6.142) gives satisfactory results. 
(2) The reaction mixture should not be heated to boiling since this leads to the 
formation of much benzhydrol. The temperature attained by heating on a boiling 
water bath is 85-90 °C.

carefully.

6.12.6 OXIME FORMATION 

Benzaldehyde reacts with hydroxylamine in the presence of sodium hydroxide 
to yield an oxime of low m.p. (a- or syn-benzaldoxime) which is stable to alkali, 
but is rapidly rearranged by acids to give an isomeric oxime of higher m.p. (/}- or 
anti-benzaldoxime) (Expt 6.145).

Details of the preparation of a-benzoinoxime ('cupron') and salicylaldoxime are 
also included in Expt 6.145; these are employed as analytical reagents for 
molybdenum and for copper and nickel respectively. 

Oximes of ketones undergo rearrangement (the Beckmann rearrangement) to 
amides under the influence of a variety of acidic reagents (e.g. sulphuric acid, 
hydrogen fluoride, acetic anhydride, phosphorus pentachloride, thionyl 
chloride, etc.). The process is illustrated by the conversion of benzophenone 
oxime to benzanilide in the presence of phosphorus pentachloride.

In the case of unsymmetrically substituted oximes (e.g. Ar'-C^NOHJ-Ar 2 ) 
the structure of the oxime (syn or anti) may be deduced by hydrolysis of the 
anilide and characterisation of the isolated carboxylic acid and amine. Thus if 
the products are Ar 1 -C0 2 H and Ar 2 NH 2 , the hydroxyl group in the oxime must 
of necessity be anti to the group Ar 2 owing to the trans intramolecular 
rearrangement step specified in the formulation above. Illustrative details for the 

1047 



6.12 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



hydrolysis of anilides and the isolation of the acidic and basic constituents are 
given in Expt 6.145. 

Experiment 6.145 a- AND jS-BENZALDOXIMES 

Ph-CHO + NH 2 OH y Ph-CH=N-OH + H 2 

In a 250-ml conical flask mix a solution of 14 g of sodium hydroxide in 40ml 
of water and 2 1 g (20 ml, 0.2 mol) of pure benzaldehyde (Expt 6. 133). Add 1 5 g 
(0.22 mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in small portions, and shake the 
mixture continually (mechanical stirring may be employed with advantage). 
Some heat is developed and the benzaldehyde eventually disappears. Upon 
cooling, a crystalline mass of the sodium derivative of the oxime separates 
out. Add sufficient water to form a clear solution, and pass carbon dioxide 
into the solution until saturated. A colourless emulsion of the a- or syn- 
aldoxime separates. Extract the oxime with ether, dry the extract over 
magnesium or anhydrous sodium sulphate and remove the ether on a water 
bath using a rotary evaporator. Distil the residue under diminished pressure 
(Fig. 2.108). Collect the pure syn-benzaldoxime (a-benzaldoxime) at 122- 
124 °C/12 mmHg; this gradually solidifies on cooling in ice and melts at 35 °C. 
The yield is 12g(49%). 

To prepare the /J-benzaldoxime, dissolve 10 g of a-benzaldoxime in 50 ml of 
pure anhydrous ether and pass dry hydrogen chloride (Section 4.2.38, p. 438) 
through a wide delivery tube into the solution with constant shaking. 
Colourless crystals of the hydrochloride of the /J-aldoxime separate. Filter 
these at the pump through a sintered glass funnel, wash with dry ether, 
transfer to a separatory funnel and cover with a layer of ether. Add a 
concentrated solution of sodium carbonate gradually and with constant 
shaking until efferevescence ceases. Separate the ethereal layer, which 
contains the /J-oxime, dry over magnesium sulphate or sodium sulphate and 
remove the ether using a rotary evaporator. The residue crystallises; remove 
the small amount of oily matter by pressing on a porous tile. Recrystallise by 
dissolving the product in the minimum volume of ether and then adding light 
petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C). The yield of /?-benzaldoxime (anti-benzaldoxime), 
m.p. 130 °C, is 7-8 g (70-80%). 

The p.m.r. spectra of these aldoximes should be recorded and compared, 
particularly with respect to the chemical shift values of the — CH=N proton. 

Cognate preparations. a-Benzilmonoxime. Grind 42 g (0.2 mol) of pure benzil 
(Expt 6.143) to a thin paste with a little ethanol, and add a concentrated 
aqueous solution of 17.5 g (0.25 mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride. Cool 
to — 5 °C in an ice-salt bath, and add 30 g of sodium hydroxide as a 20 per 
cent aqueous solution dropwise with rapid mechanical stirring: do not allow 
the temperature to rise above °C. After 90 minutes dilute the mixture with 
water and filter off the small quantity of unchanged benzil on a sintered glass 
funnel. Just acidify the filtrate with glacial acetic acid, allow to stand for 30 
minutes, filter off the crude pinkish a-monoxime and recrystallise it from 
aqueous ethanol (60 vol. % alcohol); the resulting oxime weighs 37 g (82%) 
and melts at 1 37 °C. To obtain the pure a-benzilmonoxime, recrystallise twice 
from benzene; the final yield is 28 g (62%) of the pure product, m.p. 140 °C. 
Animal charcoal must not be used in the recrystallisation (see below). 

1048 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.12 



P-Benzilmonoxime. The a-oxime is converted into the /J-form by treatment 
with a solution of hydrogen chloride in benzene (CAUTION) (or ether) at 
room temperature. From benzene, solvated crystals which melt on rapid 
heating at about 65 °C are obtained. Removal of benzene of crystallisation in 
an oven at 50 °C and recrystallisation from carbon disulphide (CAUTION) 
yields pure /J-benzilmonoxime, m.p. 112°C. The product gives no colour 
change with aqueous-alcoholic copper acetate solution; if it is contaminated 
with the a-form a greenish colour is produced. (Conversion of the a-form into 
the /J-form may also be effected by boiling in benzene solution in the presence 
of animal charcoal, which presumably contains adsorbed acidic catalysts.) 

a-Benzoinoxime. In a 250-ml round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux 
condenser, place a mixture of lOg (0.047 mol) of benzoin (Expt 6.142) and 
20 g (25 ml) of rectified spirit together with an aqueous solution of 8.0 g 
(0.087 mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride which has previously been 
neutralised with 4.4 g (0.091 mol) of sodium hydroxide. Reflux for 60 minutes. 
Add water to precipitate the benzoinoxime, and cool in an ice bath. Filter the 
solid with suction at the pump, wash it with water and recrystallise from 
dilute ethanol. Alternatively, the dry solid may be recrystallised from ether. 
The yield of pure a-benzoinoxime, m.p. 151 °C, is 5g (47%). 

Salicylaldoxime. Dissolve 20.0 g (0.1 64 mol) of salicylaldehyde (Expt 6.116) 
in 30 ml of rectified spirit, add a solution of 15 g (0.216 mol) of hydroxylamine 
hydrochloride in 10ml of water and render the mixture just alkaline with 10 
per cent sodium carbonate solution while cooling in ice. Allow to stand 
overnight. Acidify with acetic acid, distil off the alcohol under reduced 
pressure on a rotary evaporator, dilute with twice the volume of water and 
extract with two 50 ml portions of ether. Dry the ethereal extract with sodium 
sulphate or magnesium sulphate, distil off most of the ether and allow the 
residue to crystallise. Recrystallise from chloroform-light petroleum (b.p. 40- 
60 °C). The yield of salicylaldoxime, m.p. 57 °C, is 12 g (40.5%). 

Benzophenone oxime. Place a mixture of 25 g (0.137 mol) of benzophenone 
(Expt 6.121), 15g (0.216mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 50ml of 
rectified spirit and 10 ml of water in a 500- ml round-bottomed flask. Add 28 g 
(0.7 mol) of sodium hydroxide (pellet form) in portions with shaking; if the 
reaction becomes too vigorous, cool the flask with running tap water. When 
all the sodium hydroxide has been added, attach a reflux condenser to the 
flask, heat to boiling and reflux for 5 minutes. Cool, and pour the contents of 
the flask into a solution of 75 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 500 ml 
of water contained in a 1 -litre beaker. Filter the precipitate at the pump, wash 
thoroughly with cold water and dry in an oven at 40 °C or in a vacuum 
desiccator. The yield of benzophenone oxime, m.p. 142 °C, is 26.5 g (98%). It 
may be recrystallised from methanol (4 ml per gram) but the m.p. is 
unaffected. The oxime is gradually decomposed by oxygen and traces of 
moisture into benzophenone and nitric acid; it should be preserved in a 
vacuum desiccator filled with pure dry carbon dioxide or nitrogen. 

Beckmann rearrangement of benzophenone oxime to benzanilide. Dissolve 2g 
of benzophenone oxime in 20 ml of anhydrous ether in a small conical flask 
and add 3 g of powdered phosphorus pentachloride (or 3 ml of pure thionyl 
chloride). Distil off the solvent and other volatile products on a water bath on 

1049 



6.12 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



a rotary evaporator, add 25 ml of water, boil for several minutes and break up 
any lumps which may be formed. Decant the supernatant liquid, and 
recrystallise, in the same vessel, from boiling ethanol. The product is 
benzanilide, 1.6 g (80%), m.p. 163 °C; confirm this by a mixed m.p. 
determination with an authentic specimen. 

Hydrolysis of benzanilide. Place 5 g of benzanilide and 50 ml of 70 per cent 
w/w sulphuric acid (1) in a small flask fitted with a reflux condenser, and boil 
gently for 30 minutes. Some of the benzoic acid will vaporise in the steam and 
solidify in the condenser. Pour 60 ml of hot water down the condenser: this 
will dislodge and partially dissolve the benzoic acid. Cool the flask in ice- 
water; filter off the benzoic acid (aniline sulphate does not separate at this 
dilution), wash well with water, drain, dry upon filter paper and identify by 
m.p. (121 °C). Render the filtrate alkaline by cautiously adding 10 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution, cool and isolate the aniline by ether extraction. 
Remove the ether and distil the aniline, b.p. 1 84 °C. 

Note. (1) For preparation see Expt 6.68, Note (3). 

6.12.7 SOME REACTIONS OF ALKYL ARYL KETONES 

Aryl methyl ketones can only give a single enol (or enolate ion) and subsequent 
reactions are therefore entirely regioselective. These include halogenation (cf. 
Section 5.11.1, p. 667), and the Mannich reaction (cf. Section 5.18.2, p. 801). 

Bromination of the methyl group can be restricted to monOsubstitution when 
the reaction is carried out in acidic media. The mechanism involves protonation 
of the carbonyl-oxygen, followed by proton loss to give the enol. After 
monobromination, protonation of the bromoketone is less favourable owing to 
the presence of the electron-withdrawing halogen atom. Further enolisation 
does not occur therefore and halogenation ceases (contrast the behaviour of 
methyl ketones on bromination under alkaline conditions, p. 667); the product is 
an aryl bromomethyl ketone or phenacyl bromide. 




The preparation of p-bromophenacyl bromide, which is a useful reagent for the 
characterisation of carboxylic acids (Section 9.6.15, p. 1261), is described in Expt 
6.146. 

Condensation of the active methyl group in acetophenone with formaldehyde 
and dimethylamine (in the form of its hydrochloride) is an example of the 
Mannich reaction (e.g. the synthesis of dimethylaminopropiophenone, Expt 
6.147). The probable mechanism of the reaction involves the intermediate 
formation of the hydroxymethyldimethylamine which eliminates water to form 
the reactive species (1). This condenses with the a-carbon atom of acetophenone 
reacting in its enol form.

Other compounds containing active hydrogen atoms similarly undergo the 
Mannich reaction, and a further interesting example is provided by the synthesis 
of dimethylaminomethylindole (gramine), in which indole is the reactive 
component (cognate preparation in Expt 6.147). 

CH 2 =NMe 2 





The quaternary salts produced by the Mannich reaction undergo a number 
of conversions useful in synthesis. For example, although stable at room 
temperature they eliminate an amine hydrochloride on heating to yield an a,/?- 
unsaturated ketone (e.g. the conversion of dimethylaminopropiophenone to 
phenyl vinyl ketone, Expt 6.147). 

aA^HM^CI ~* A A^CH 2 + Me 2 §H 2 }Cl 

This ready decomposition makes Mannich bases convenient in situ sources of 
&lt;x,/?-unsaturated carbonyl compounds (see also Section 7.2, p. 1094). 

A further example of the usefulness of Mannich bases is illustrated by the 
reaction of dimethylaminopropiophenone hydrochloride on heating with 
aqueous potassium cyanide, which results in the ready replacement of the 
dimethylamino group by the nitrile group forming j8-benzoylpropionitrile. This 
replacement occurs even more readily when the dimethylamino compound is of 
the benzylic type, as in gramine. When the latter is boiled for a long time with 
aqueous potassium cyanide, the plant growth hormone 3-indolylacetic acid is 
formed by way of hydrolysis of the intermediate nitrile. 




When an alkyl aryl ketone is heated with yellow ammonium polysulphide 
solution at elevated temperature, an aryl-substituted aliphatic acid amide is 
formed; the product actually isolated is the amide of the cy-arylcarboxylic acid 
together with a smaller amount of the corresponding ammonium salt of the 
carboxylic acid.

This conversion of a carbonyl compound by ammonium polysulphide solution 
into an amide with the same number of carbon atoms is known as the Willgerodt 
reaction. The procedure has been improved by the addition of about 40 per cent 
of dioxane or of pyridine to increase the mutual solubility of the ketone and 
aqueous ammonium polysulphide; the requisite temperature is lowered to about 
160 °C and the yield is generally better. 

A further improvement is embodied in the Kindler variation of the Willgerodt 
reaction which is illustrated by several examples in Expt 6.148. This consists of 
heating the ketone with approximately equal amounts of sulphur and a dry 
amine (e.g. morpholine) instead of aqueous ammonium polysulphide. The 
principal product is a thioamide, and subsequent hydrolysis with acid or alkali 
affords the carboxylic acid, usually in good yield.

An evaluation of this complex and variable reaction concludes that it cannot be

Experiment 6.146 a,/&gt;-DIBROMOACETOPHENONE (p-Bromophenacyl 
bromide) 

p-BrC 6 H 4 -CO-Me Me .^ H &gt; p-Br-C 6 H 4 -CO-CH 2 Br 

Place a solution of 50 g (0.25 mol) of p-bromoacetophenone (Expt 6.122) in 
100 ml of glacial acetic acid in a 500-ml flask. Add very slowly (about 30 
minutes) from a dropping funnel 40 g (12.5 ml, 0.25 mol) of bromine 
(CAUTION); shake the mixture vigorously during the addition and keep the 
temperature below 20 °C. p-Bromophenacyl bromide commences to separate 
as needles after about half of the bromine has been introduced. When the 
addition is complete, cool the mixture in ice-water, filter the crude product at 
the pump and wash it with 50 per cent alcohol until colourless (about 100 ml 
are required). Recrystallise from rectified (or industrial) spirit (c. 400 ml). The 
yield of pure p-bromophenacyl bromide (colourless needles, m.p. 109 °C) is 
50g(72%). 

Cognate preparation. a-Bromo-p-phenylacetophenone (p-phenylphenacyl 
bromide). Suspend 36 g (0.183 mol) of p-phenylacetophenone in 200 ml of 
glacial acetic acid in a 500-ml flask, warm gently on a water bath until a clear 
solution results, then cool as far as possible without the formation of crystals. 
To this solution add 29.5 g (9.5 ml, 0.1 84 mol) of bromine; do not allow the 
temperature to rise above 45 °C during the addition. The brominated product 

1052 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS S.I 2 



separates from the solution when about three-quarters of the bromine has 
been added. After 2 hours, cool the flask in a bath of ice and salt, filter the 
product, wash with a little cold glacial acetic acid, followed by small volumes 
of water until all the acid has been removed. The yield of crude material, m.p. 
124.5-125.5 °C, is 42 g (83%). Recrystallise from hot rectified spirit (600- 
700 ml) and add a little decolourising carbon to remove the colour: pure, 
colourless p-phenylphenacyl bromide, m.p. 125.5 °C, is obtained.

CHLORIDE (Mannich reaction) 

Ph-COMe + H-CHO + Me 2 NH 2 }Cl e &gt; Ph-CO(CH 2 ) 2 -NHMe 2 }Cl e 

Place 26.5 g (0.326 mol) of dry dimethylamine hydrochloride, 10 g (0.33 mol) 
of powdered paraformaldehyde and 30 g (29.3 ml, 0.25 mol) of acetophenone 
in a 250-ml round-bottomed flask attached to a reflux condenser. Introduce 
40 ml of 95 per cent ethanol to which 0.5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
has been added, and reflux the mixture on a water bath for 2 hours; the 
reaction mixture should ultimately be almost clear and homogeneous. Filter 
the yellowish solution (if necessary) through a hot-water funnel: transfer the 
filtrate to a 500-ml wide-mouthed conical flask and, while still warm, add 
200 ml of acetone. Allow to cool to room temperature and leave in a 
refrigerator overnight. Filter the crystals at the pump, wash with 10 ml of 
acetone and dry for 6 hours at 40-50 °C: the yield of crude product, m.p. 152- 
155 °C, is 38 g (71%). Recrystallise the crude product by dissolving in 45 ml of 
hot rectified spirit and slowly adding 225 ml of acetone to the solution; collect 
the solid which separates by suction filtration and dry at 70 °C. The purified 
material melts at 155-156 °C and the recovery is about 90 per cent. 

Conversion into 3-benzoylpropionitrile 

Ph-CO(CH 2 ) 2 -NHMe 2 }Cl e -^&gt; Ph-CO(CH 2 ) 2 -CN + Me 2 NH + KC1 

To a mixture of 21.4 g (0.1 mol) of dimethylaminopropiophenone hydro- 
chloride and 13.0g (0.2 mol) of potassium cyanide in a 500-ml flask, add 
260 ml of boiling water; heat the heterogeneous mixture under reflux for 30 
minutes. Part of the dimethylamine, which is eliminated in the reaction, 
distils: collect this in dilute hydrochloric acid. Cool the reaction mixture in 
ice; the oil solidifies and crystals form in the aqueous layer. Collect the solid 
[crude 3-benzoylpropionitrile, 10.5 g (66%)] by suction filtration and 
recrystallise it from benzene-light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C); the product 
separates as almost colourless blades, m.p. 76 °C. 

Conversion to phenyl vinyl ketone. Place an intimate mixture of 21.4 g 
(0.1 mol) of j8-dimethylaminopropiophenone hydrochloride and 0.2 g of 
hydroquinone in a 100-ml round-bottomed flask. Attach a Claisen still-head 
fitted with a stout capillary air leak and condenser arranged for distillation 
under reduced pressure; place a few crystals of hydroquinone in the receiving 
flask. Pyrolyse the amine hydrochloride by heating the flask in an electric 
mantle at 2 mmHg (oil immersion pump), and collect the crude ketone which 
distils between 70 and 90 °C. On redistillation 7g (51%) of pure phenyl vinyl 
ketone, b.p. 72-73 °C/3 mmHg (115 °C/18 mmHg), are obtained. Characterise 

1053 



6.12 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the product by reaction with phenylhydrazine in the following way. Dissolve 
0.5 g of phenylhydrazine hydrochloride and 0.5 g of sodium acetate trihydrate 
in the minimum of water, and add 0.5 g of the ketone followed by a little 
ethanol to give a homogeneous solution. Heat the mixture on a steam bath 
for 5-10 minutes, collect the product which separates on cooling and 
crystallise it from ethanol. Yellow needles of l,3-diphenyl-2-pyrazoline, m.p. 
154°C, are obtained. 

Cognate preparation. Dimethylaminomethylindole (gramine). Cool 42.5 ml 
(0.236 mol) of aqueous dimethylamine solution (c. 25% w/v) contained in a 
100-ml flask in an ice bath, add 30 g of cold acetic acid, followed by 17.2g 
(0.21 mol) of cold, 37 per cent aqueous formaldehyde solution. Pour the 
solution on to 23.4 g (0.2 mol) of indole; use 10 ml of water to rinse out the 
flask. Allow the mixture to warm up to room temperature, with occasional 
shaking as the indole dissolves. Keep the solution at 30-40 °C overnight and 
then pour it, with vigorous stirring, into a solution of 40 g of potassium 
hydroxide in 300 ml of water; crystals separate. Cool in an ice bath for 2 
hours, collect the crystalline solid by suction filtration, wash with three 50 ml 
portions of cold water and dry to constant weight at 50 °C. The yield of 
gramine is 34 g (97.5%); this is quite suitable for conversion into 3- 
indolylacetic acid. The pure compound may be obtained by recrystallisation 
from acetone-hexane; m.p. 133-134 °C. 

Conversion into 3-indolylacetic acid. In a 1 -litre flask, fitted with a reflux 
condenser, place a solution of 35.2 g (0.72 mol) of sodium cyanide 
(CAUTION) in 70 ml of water, then add 25 g (0.144 mol) of gramine and 
280 ml of 95 per cent ethanol. Boil the mixture under reflux for 80 hours. 
Dilute the cooled reaction mixture with 350 ml of water, shake with a little 
activated charcoal (e.g., Norit), filter and concentrate to about 350 ml under 
reduced pressure (water pump) in order to remove most of the alcohol. Cool 
to about 5 °C, filter off the solid and wash it with a little cold water; keep the 
filtrate (A). Recrystallise the solid from ethanol-ether to obtain 5.0 g (20%) of 
3-indolylacetamide, m.p. 150-151 °C. 

Concentrate the filtrate (A) to about 300 ml, cool to 5-10 °C and add 
concentrated hydrochloric acid dropwise and with vigorous stirring (fume 
cupboard: hydrogen cyanide is evolved) to a pH of 1-2 (about 50 ml); a crude, 
slightly pink 3-indolylacetic acid is precipitated. The yield of crude acid, m.p. 
159-161 °C, is 20 g. Recrystallise from 1,2-dichloroethane containing a small 
amount of ethanol; 17.5 g (70%) of pure 3-indolylacetic acid, m.p. 167-168 °C, 
are obtained.

In a conical or round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser by means

1054 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.12 



1.1 mol) of morpholine (b.p. 126-128 °C). Reflux in the fume cupboard gently 
at first until the evolution of hydrogen sulphide subsides and then more 
vigorously for a total period of 14 hours. Pour the hot reaction mixture, 
which has separated into two layers, into 400 ml of warm ethanol and leave to 
crystallise. The 2-naphthylthioacetomorpholide separates as pale buff 
crystals. Filter at the pump and wash with a little cold ethanol; the yield of 
crude thiomorpholide, m.p. 103-108 °C, is 178 g (87%). 

Mix 130 g (0.48 mol) of the crude thiomorpholide with 270 ml of glacial 
acetic acid, 40 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and 60 ml of water; raise the 
temperature of the mixture carefully to the boiling point and reflux for 5 
hours. Decant the solution from a little tarry matter into 2 litres of water and 
keep overnight. Collect the solid by suction filtration and wash it well with 
cold water. Digest the solid with a solution of 50 g of sodium hydroxide in 
1 litre of water, filter and acidify the filtrate with hydrochloric acid; filter off the 
crude 2-naphthylacetic acid, wash with water and dry. The yield of the crude 
acid, m.p. 137-140 °C, is 75 g (84%). Recrystallisation from benzene raises the 
m.p. to 142-143 °C; the loss is about 10 per cent. 

Cognate preparations. 3-Phenylpropanoic acid (hydrocinnamic acid). Reflux a 
mixture of 53.5 g (0.4 mol) ofpropiophenone(Expt 6.126), 20.5 g (0.64 mol) of 
sulphur and 46 g (46 ml, 0.53 mol) of morpholine for 6 hours. Pour the 
reaction product into 400 ml of 10 per cent ethanolic sodium hydroxide 
solution and reflux for 7 hours. Distil off the ethanol, dilute with water, 
acidify with hydrochloric acid (to Congo red paper) and extract three times 
with ether. Wash the ether extracts with water, dry, remove the ether and 
distil. Collect the hydrocinnamic acid at 125-129 °C/6mmHg; it solidifies 
completely on cooling, m.p. 46-47 °C. The yield is 39 g (65%). 

p-Methoxyphenylacetic acid. Reflux a mixture of 42 g (0.28 mol) of p- 
methoxyacetophenone (Expt 6.122), 13.5 g (0.42mol) of sulphur and 36.5g 
(36 ml, 0.42 mol) of morpholine for 5 hours. Pour the reaction mixture slowly 
into water, allowing the first addition to crystallise before the bulk of the 
mixture is added. Filter off the crude yellow solid, grind it up thoroughly with 
water, filter again and dry in the air. The yield of crude thioacetomorpholide, 
m.p. 65-67 °C, is 56 g (80%). Recrystallisation from dilute methanol raises the 
m.p. to 71-72 °C. 

Add 50 g of the crude thioacetomorpholide to 400 ml of 10 per cent 
ethanolic sodium hydroxide solution and reflux the mixture for 10 hours. 
Distil off most of the ethanol, add 100 ml of water to the residue and strongly 
acidify the alkaline solution with hydrochloric acid. Cool, extract thrice with 
ether, dry the combined ether extracts, evaporate the solvent and recrystallise 
the residue from water or dilute ethanol. The yield of p-methoxyphenylacetic 
acid, m.p. 85-86 °C, is 26 g (63% overall). A further quantity of acid may be 
obtained by extracting the mother-liquors with ether. 

p-Bromophenylacetic acid. Reflux a mixture of 50 g (0.25 mol) of p- 
bromoacetophenone (Expt 6.122), 12.8 g (0.4 mol) of sulphur and 30 ml 
(0.35 mol) of morpholine for 8 hours. Saponify the crude reaction product 
with 250 ml of 10 per cent ethanolic sodium hydroxide solution and work up 
as described for the p-methoxy acid. The yield of crude p-bromophenylacetic 
acid, m.p. 107-109 °C, is 25 g (46%). Recrystallisation from water gives the 
pare acid, m.p. 113-1 14 °C.

6.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



6.12.8 SOME METHODS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE AROMATIC CARBONYL GROUP 

The methods which are available for the protection of the aromatic carbonyl 
group are similar to those for the aliphatic and alicyclic analogues (Section 5.8.8, 
p. 623). It should be noted however, that when a cyclic acetal is used as the 
protecting group, a Birch reduction (Section 7.5) on the protected compound 
usually results in hydrogenolysis of the protecting acetal. 

6.13 AROMATIC CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 

This section is principally concerned with the synthesis of carboxylic acids in 
which the carboxyl group is directly attached to the aromatic nucleus. Several 
examples of the preparation of acids in which the carboxyl group is located in 
the side chain, i.e. aryl-substituted aliphatic acids, are included in Section 5.12. 

1. Oxidative methods (Expts 6.149 to 6.152). 

2. The hydrolysis of nitriles (Expts 6.153 to 6.155). 

3. Carboxylation of the aromatic ring system (Expts 6.156 to 6.158). 

4. Nuclear nitration of aromatic carboxylic esters and acids (Expts 6.159 and 
6.160). 

Methods for the protection of the aromatic carboxyl group are considered in 
Section 6.13.5.

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.13 



SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

The characteristic profile of the i.r. spectral region (2500-3300 cm -1 ), corre- 
sponding to absorption arising from the intermolecular hydrogen bonding of 
the carboxyl group, is easily observed (p. 299). The frequency of absorption 
arising from the carbonyl group is a little lower than in aliphatic carboxylic 
acids owing to aromatic mesomeric interaction. The substitution pattern in the 
aromatic nucleus may be inferred from the longer wavelength region of the i.r. 
spectrum and may be confirmed by inspection of the p.m.r. spectrum. The latter 
will also show a low field signal from the acidic proton if the sample is dissolved 
in a solvent with which it does not undergo a deuterium exchange reaction (e.g. 
phenylacetic acid, Fig. 3.47). (The 13 C-n.m.r. spectrum is given in Fig. 3.55.) The 
m.s. of orf/io-substituted acids (and their derivatives) is discussed on p. 383, and 
analyses of fragmentation patterns of suitable compounds are included in some 
of the preparative examples below. 

6.13.1 OXIDATIVE METHODS 

The oxidation of an alkyl group attached to an aromatic system is a frequently 
used method for the preparation of the corresponding carboxylic acid. 

Ar-R -^U Ar-C0 2 H 

The conversion can be accomplished most readily in the laboratory by using 
either a solution of sodium dichromate in concentrated sulphuric acid or 
aqueous potassium permanganate. The method is not applicable to those cases 
where activating groups are attached to the aromatic system, since these render 
the ring susceptible to oxidative cleavage. The use of acid dichromate is 
illustrated in Expt 6.149 by the oxidation of p-nitrotoluene and of p-xylene. The 
examples illustrating the use of potassium permanganate in Expt 6.150 are the 
oxidation of two isomeric chlorotoluenes and the three isomeric picolines 
(methylpyridines). 

Diphenic acid (Expt 6.151) is obtained when phenanthrene is oxidised with 
30 per cent hydrogen peroxide in glacial acetic acid solution at 85 °C. No 
phenanthraquinone is formed under these conditions (compare the oxidation of 
phenanthrene with acid dichromate, Expt 6.128); the reaction is essentially an 
oxidation by peracetic acid of the reactive 9,10-positions in phenanthrene. 

Experiment 6.152 describes a synthesis of quinaldinic acid from quinaldine 
(2-methylquinoline). The method depends upon the reactive nature of the 2- 
methyl group in quinaldine which can readily be brominated using bromine in 
acetic acid. Hydrolysis of the resulting tribromo derivative by boiling with dilute 
sulphuric acid occurs smoothly to give the corresponding carboxylic acid in 
good yield. 

The use of the haloform reaction for the conversion of methyl ketones into 
carboxylic acids (Sections 5.11.1, p. 667) is also applicable in the aromatic field. 
The conditions may be readily adapted from those described for the conversion 
of aliphatic methyl ketones into carboxylic acids (Expt 5.124).

1057 



6.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Place 46 g (0.33 mol) of p-nitrotoluene, 1 36 g of sodium dichromate dihydrate 
and 300 ml of water in a 1 -litre, two-necked round- bottomed flask equipped 
with an unsealed mechanical stirrer. By means of a dropping funnel, add 
340 g (185 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid during about 30 minutes to the 
well-stirred mixture. The heat of dilution of the acid causes the p-nitrotoluene 
to melt and oxidation takes place; if the reaction shows signs of becoming 
vigorous, the rate of addition must be reduced. When all the sulphuric acid 
has been introduced and the temperature of the mixture commences to fall, 
attach a reflux condenser to the flask, and heat to gentle boiling for half an 
hour. Cool and pour the reaction mixture into 400-500 ml of water. Filter the 
crude p-nitrobenzoic acid at the pump and wash it with about 200 ml of 
water. Transfer the solid to a 1-litre beaker, add about 200 ml of 5 per cent 
sulphuric acid ( 1 1 g or 6 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid added to 200 ml of 
water) and digest on a water bath, with agitation, in order to remove the 
chromium salts as completely as possbile; allow to cool and filter again. 
Transfer the acid to a beaker, break up any lumps of material and treat it with 
5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until the liquid remains alkaline. The p- 
nitrobenzoic acid passes into solution, any unchanged p-nitrotoluene 
remains undissolved and chromium salts are converted into chromic 
hydroxide and/or sodium chromite. Add about 5 g of decolourising carbon, 
warm to about 50 °C with stirring for 5 minutes and filter with suction. Run 
the alkaline solution of sodium p-nitrobenzoate into about 450 ml of well- 
stirred 1 5 per cent sulphuric acid (74 g or 40 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid 
in 400 ml of water). Do not add the acid to the alkaline solution, for in this 
way the acid is liable to be contaminated by the sodium salt. Filter the 
purified acid at the pump, wash it thoroughly with cold water and dry it in the 
oven. The yield of p-nitrobenzoic acid, m.p. 237 °C, is 48 g (86%): this is 
sufficiently pure for most purposes. Upon recrystallisation from glacial acetic 
acid, the m.p. is raised to 239 °C. 

The i.r. spectrum should be recorded and the absorptions of the functional 
groups assigned. The p.m.r. spectrum (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) is a good example of 
a case where the Av value for the two pairs of aromatic protons approaches that 
of their coupling constant (p. 343); 5 8.21 (d, 2H, ortho-H's, to C0 2 H), and 
8.30 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to N0 2 ). This spectrum should be compared with that 
of the meta isomer, Expt 6.159. 

Cognate preparation. Terephthalic acid. Use 18 g (0.1 69 mol) of p-xylene in 
place of the p-nitrotoluene and proceed as above to the stage of isolation of 
the crude product. Wash this with 40 ml of water followed by 20 ml of ether 
and purify, isolate and dry the acid as detailed above for p-nitrobenzoic acid; 
the yield of colourless terephthalic acid is 12 g (44%); it sublimes without 
melting at 300 °C and is almost insoluble in water and ethanol. 

Experiment 6.150 o-CHLOROBENZOIC ACID 

o-Cl-C 6 H 4 -Me -^^&gt; o-Cl-C 6 H 4 -C0 2 H 

Place 1250 ml of water, 75 g of pure potassium permanganate and 50 g 
(0.4 mol) of o-chlorotoluene (Expt 6.71) in a 2.5-litre three-necked flask 
equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser. Stir the 
mixture and reflux gently until practically all the permanganate colour has 



1058 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.13 



disappeared (about 2 hours). At this point add 37.5 g more of potassium 
permanganate and reflux the mixture again until the permanganate colour 
disappears (about 2 hours); the colour of the solution can easily be seen by 
removing the flame and stopping the refluxing. Finally, add a second 37.5 g 
(0.95 mol total) of potassium permanganate and continue refluxing until the 
permanganate colour has disappeared (about 2-4 hours) (1). Steam distil the 
mixture (Fig. 2.102) to remove unreacted o-chlorotoluene (about 12 g). Filter 
the hot contents of the flask from the manganese dioxide with suction (2) and 
wash with two 125-ml portions of hot water. Concentrate the filtrate to about 
800 ml using a rotary evaporator (3), and precipitate the o-chlorobenzoic acid 
by cautiously adding 75 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid with continual 
stirring. When cold, filter with suction, wash the acid with cold water and dry 
at 100 °C. The yield of o-chlorobenzoic acid, m.p. 138-139 °C, is 42g (68%). 
Upon recrystallisation from hot water or from toluene (c. 4 ml per gram), the 
m.p. is raised to 139-140 °C. 

The p.m.r. spectra (DMSO-d 6 , TMS) of the three isomeric chlorobenzoic 
acids show the following signals for the aromatic protons: ortho isomer 3 6.8- 
8.00 (m, 4H); meta isomer 3 7.27-7.72 (m, 2H) and 7.80-8.2 (m, 2H); para 
isomer 3 7.56 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to CI) and 8.0 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to C0 2 H). 

Notes. (1) A somewhat lower yield is obtained if all the potassium permanganate 
(150g) is added all at once and, furthermore, the reaction may become violent. 
Addition in three portions results in a more controllable reaction. 

(2) The addition of a Whatman filter tablet or of a little diatomaceous earth (Super 
Cel, etc.) assists in the filtration of the finely divided manganese dioxide. 

(3) If the acid is precipitated before the solution is concentrated, the yield is 
considerably reduced (c. 25 g). If the concentrated solution is not clear, it may be 
clarified by the addition of 1 g of decolourising charcoal. 

Cognate preparations. p-Chlorobenzoic acid. Proceed exactly as for o- 
chlorobenzoic acid. Use 1250 ml of water, 50 g (0.4 mol) of p-chlorotoluene 
(Expt 6.71) and 75 g, 37.5 g and 37.5 g (0.95 mol total) of potassium 
permanganate. When the oxidation is complete, steam distil the mixture to 
recover any unreacted p-chlorotoluene (3-4 g). Filter the reaction mixture 
from hydrated manganese dioxide and wash the precipitate with two 100 ml 
portions of water. Precipitate the p-chlorobenzoic acid in the filtrate (1) by 
the addition of 75 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Filter the cold 
solution with suction, wash with cold water and dry in an oven at 100 °C. The 
yield of p-chlorobenzoic acid, m.p. 234-235 °C, is 55 g (89%). Recrystallisa- 
tion from hot water raises the m.p. to 238-239 °C. 

Note. (1) If the filtrate has a faint permanganate colour, add a few drops of sodium 
metabisulphite solution until the solution is colourless. In this case (compare o- 
chlorobenzoic acid) concentration of the solution before precipitation only increases 
the yield by about 1 g and may cause occlusion of inorganic salts. 

Picolinic acid (pyridine-2-carboxylic acid). Equip a 3-litre three-necked flask 
with a thermometer, sealed stirrer unit and a reflux condenser (Liebig pattern 
with a wide inner tube). Place a solution of 100 g (106 ml, 1.08 mol) of 2- 
methylpyridine in 1 litre of water in the flask and heat to 70 °C on a water 
bath. Add 450 g (2.84 mol) of potassium permanganate in 10 equal portions 
through the condenser over a period of 3-4 hours; maintain the temperature 
at 70 °C for the first five additions and at 85-90 °C for the last five. Make each

successive addition of potassium permanganate only after the preceding 
amount is decolourised and wash it down with 20-25 ml of water. After the 
last charge of potassium permanganate is decolourised, raise the temperature 
to 95 °C, filter the hot reaction mixture with suction and wash the manganese 
dioxide cake on the filter with four 200 ml portions of hot water: allow each 
portion to soak into the cake without application of vacuum and finally suck 
dry before adding fresh wash water. Evaporate down the combined filtrate 
and washings to a volume of about 300 ml: allow to cool and adjust to a pH 
of 3.2 (the isoelectric point) using narrow-range indicator paper (about 
125 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid are required). Picolinic acid is very 
soluble in water (90 g in 100 ml of water at 9°C) and therefore does not 
separate at this stage. Subject this aqueous acidic solution to continuous 
extraction with 1 litre of dichloromethane for 6 hours (Fig. 2.95). Dry the 
dichloromethane extract with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filter and remove 
the dichloromethane under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, 
removing the residual traces of dichloromethane as completely as possible. 
Transfer the solid to a vacuum desiccator and leave to dry. Place the 
powdered solid in the thimble of a large Soxhlet extraction apparatus (Fig. 
2.97) with 1250 ml of benzene (CAUTION) in the flask assembled in an 
efficient fume cupboard (1). Continue the extraction until crystals of picolinic 
acid separate from the boiling solution. Stop the extraction, cool the benzene 
to 15 °C and filter to remove the first crop of picolinic acid. Return the 
benzene filtrate to the Soxhlet extraction flask and exhaustively extract the 
remainder of the product from the residue in the Soxhlet thimble. The 
combined yield of picolinic acid of m.p. 137-138 °C is 81 g (61%). The m.p. is 
unaffected by recrystallisation from ethanol. 

Note. (1) The use of toluene as the extraction solution could be usefully explored in 
this case. 

Nicotinic acid (pyridine-3-carboxylic acid). Dissolve 100 g (104.5 ml, 
1.08 mol) of 3-methylpyridine (99% purity) in 1 litre of water and oxidise it 
with 450 g (2.84 mol) of potassium permanganate: follow the experimental 
details given under picolinic acid. Wash the manganese dioxide cake with four 
500 ml portions of water; evaporate the combined filtrate and washings to 
about 1250 ml. Adjust the pH to 3.4 (the isoelectric point) with the aid of 
narrow-range indicator paper; 120-1 30 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
are required. Allow to cool overnight, collect the voluminous precipitate of 
nicotinic acid by suction filtration, wash with three 50 ml portions of cold 
water and dry at 90-100 °C. Concentrate the filtrate to about 650 ml and cool 
slowly to 5 °C and so obtain a second crop of nicotinic acid: the purpose of 
the slow cooling is to reduce the contamination by potassium chloride. The 
first crop of acid weights 90 g and has a purity of about 90 per cent (1); the 
second crop weighs 10 g and the purity is about 80 per cent. Recrystallise 
from hot water (2) and dry at 100 °C; the yield of pure nicotinic acid, m.p. 
235 °C, from 90 g of the crude acid is 67 g (51%). A further quantity may be 
obtained by concentrating the mother-liquor. 

Notes. (1) The impurity is potassium chloride. The approximate acid content is 
determined by heating a weighed sample of the acid in a crucible gently at first and 
finally at a red heat until no trace of black residue remains, and weighing the white 
residual potassium chloride.

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.13 



(2) The solubility of pure nicotinic acid in 1000 ml of water at 0, 40, 80 and 100 °C is 
1.0, 2.6, 8.2 and 12.7 g respectively. 

Isonicotinic acid (pyridine-4-carboxylic acid). Use lOOg (104.5 ml, 1.08 mol) 
of 4-methylpyridine (98% purity) and oxidise it with 450 g (2.84 mol) of 
potassium permanganate: follow the experimental details given for picolinic 
acid. Evaporate the combined filtrate and washings to about 1500 ml and add 
concentrated hydrochloric acid until the pH is 3.6; isonicotinic acid 
precipitates. Heat to 90-95 °C (not all the acid dissolves) and allow the 
mixture to crystallise slowly. Collect the crude isonicotinic acid by suction 
filtration, wash well with water and dry at 100 °C. Concentrate the mother- 
liquor to about half the original volume and so obtain a second crop of acid. 
The first crop of acid weighs 85 g (64%) (99% pure) and the second crop 
weighs 7g (80% pure). Recrystallise from hot water: the resulting isonicotinic 
acid is pure and has a m.p. of 3 1 1 °C (sealed tube). 

The solubility of isonicotinic acid in 1000 ml of water at 0, 40, 80 and 
100 °C is 3, 9, 24 and 34 g respectively. The solubility is appreciably less in the 
presence of potassium chloride. 

Experiment 6.151 DIPHENIC ACID (Biphenyl-2, Tricarboxylic acid)

Equip a 3-litre three-necked flask with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux 
condenser and a thermometer. Dissolve 89 g (0.5 mol) of pure phenanthrene 
(1) in 1 litre of glacial acetic acid in the flask and warm to 85 °C on a water 
bath. Introduce 345 ml of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide solution (4 mol) 
during 40 minutes [CAUTION: see Section 4.2.41, p. 439~\; the temperature 
falls to about 80 °C and some phenanthrene may precipitate. After the 
addition is complete, heat the mixture with stirring on a water bath for a 
further 3-4 hours. Reduce the volume of the solution to about half by 
distillation under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator and allow to 
cool. Filter off the considerable amount of diphenic acid which crystallises 
out on cooling. Keep the filtrate and evaporate it almost to dryness under 
reduced pressure: extract the residue with 375 ml of 10 per cent sodium 
carbonate solution by warming on a water bath, boil the extract with a little 
decolourising carbon, filter and add dilute hydrochloric acid until the pH is 
4.5 (use narrow-range indicator paper). Stir the solution with a further small 
amount of active charcoal and filter off the tarry material; cool the clear 
solution to 0°C and acidify with dilute hydrochloric acid. Collect the 
precipitate by suction filtration, wash with water and dry at 1 10 °C. The total 
yield of crude diphenic acid, m.p. 228 °C, is 83 g (69%). Recrystallisation from 
glacial acetic acid raises the m.p. to 230 °C. 

Note. (1) Technical phenanthrene may be purified as follows. Dissolve 500 g of 
technical 90 per cent phenanthrene in 3 litres of ethanol in a 4-litre flask on a steam

7.5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid from the dropping funnel. Reflux the solution for 
15 minutes, and then pour it with vigorous stirring into 1225 ml of water in a 3-litre 
round-bottomed flask. Filter when cold, wash with water and dry in the air. Distil the 
product under reduced pressure (oil pump) using a short air condenser and collect the 
phenanthrene at 148-149 °C/1 mmHg. Recrystallise the solidified distillate from 
ethanol: 200-225 g of nearly white phenanthrene, m.p. 99 °C, are obtained.

Fit a 500-ml, two-necked round-bottomed flask with a reflux condenser and 
dropping funnel. Place a mixture of 50 g (0.61 mol) of anhydrous, powdered 
sodium acetate (Section 4.2.69, p. 464), 100 g of glacial acetic acid and 14 g 
(0.1 mol) of pure 2-methylquinoline in the flask, and a solution of 48 g 
(15.5 ml, 0.3 mol) of bromine (CAUTION) in 100 g of glacial acetic acid in the 
dropping funnel. Heat the flask to 70 C C in a water bath, and add the bromine 
solution during 10-15 minutes while keeping the mixture thoroughly shaken. 
Remove the flask from the water bath, bring the solution to boiling for a few 
minutes (until the separation of sodium bromide causes violent bumping) 
and then heat for 30 minutes on a boiling water bath and allow to cool. Pour 
the reaction mixture into 300 ml of ice-water, collect the precipitate by 
suction filtration and wash thoroughly with water. The yield of crude 
product, after drying at 100 °C, is 36 g (95%). Recrystallise from ethanol or 
glacial acetic acid: the pure oj-tribromoquinaldine has m.p. 128 °C. 

Hydrolyse the oj-tribromoquinaldine by boiling it under reflux with excess 
of dilute (1 : 10) sulphuric acid until a test portion, on neutralisation, yields no 
unchanged halogen compound. The quinaldinic acid is best isolated, via the 
copper salt, in the following manner. Cool, nearly neutralise the solution and 
add excess of copper(n) sulphate solution. Collect the pale green copper 
quinaldinate by suction filtration and wash it well with cold water. Suspend 
the copper salt in hot water and subject it to prolonged treatment with 
hydrogen sulphide gas. Filter off the copper sulphide and evaporate the clear 
filtrate to dryness on a water bath. Recrystallise the residual quinaldinic acid 
from glacial acetic acid; it then melts at 157°C. The yield is almost 
quantitative. 

6.13.2 THE HYDROLYSIS OF NITRILES 

The hydrolysis of nitriles under either acidic or basic conditions, which has 
already been discussed in Section 5.11.2, p. 671, for alkyl and aralkyl nitriles, is 
equally applicable to the synthesis of aromatic carboxylic acids (Expt 6.153). 
The aromatic nitriles are readily obtained by the Sandmeyer reaction (see 
Section 6.7.1, p. 923). 

In the preparation of 2-naphthoic acid (Expt 6.154) the preferred starting 
material is 2-naphthylamine-l-sulphonic acid (see Section 6.5.4, p. 900). After 

1062 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.13 



replacement of the amino by the cyano group using the Sandmeyer procedure, 
subsequent treatment with aqueous acid removes the sulphonic acid group (see 
Section 6.7.1, p. 924 and Section 6.9.2, p. 975) and hydrolyses the cyano group in 
one step. 

The formation of a carboxyl group by hydrolysis of the corresponding nitrile 
constitutes the last step in an interesting multi-stage synthesis of homophthalic 
acid (Expt 6.155). The starting material is phthalic anhydride which is first 
converted into the cyclic imide, phthalimide (1), by treatment with aqueous 
ammonia, or more conveniently with urea. Reduction of phthalimide with a 
zinc-copper couple in the presence of alkali is the most convenient laboratory 
preparation of phthalide (3), although the latter can also be obtained by the 
direct reduction of phthalic anhydride. 59 The immediate reduction product is 
the salt of o-hydroxymethylbenzoic acid (2); on acidification this gives the free 
acid which cyclises to the y-lactone, phthalide (3). Nucleophilic attack of a 
cyanide ion on the methylene group in phthalide results in alkyl-oxygen fission 
of the lactone ring to yield o-cyanomethylbenzoic acid, which on hydrolysis 
yields homophthalic acid.

Method A {acidic hydrolysis). Prepare o-tolunitrile, b.p. 94-96 °C/20 mmHg, 
from o-toluidine following the method given in Expt 6.76 under p-toluidine. 
Also prepare 600 g of 75 per cent sulphuric acid by adding 450 g (245 ml) of 
concentrated sulphuric acid cautiously, with stirring and cooling, to 150 ml of 
water. Place the latter in a 1 -litre three- necked flask, equipped with a 
dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser. Heat the solution 
in an oil bath to about 150 °C, stir and add 220 g (1.88 mol) of o-tolunitrile 
during 2 hours. Continue the stirring for a further 2 hours while the 
temperature is maintained at 150-1 60 °C; finally raise the temperature to 
190 °C and stir for another hour. Some crystalline solid will appear in the 
condenser at this stage. Allow the reaction mixture to cool, pour into ice-cold 
water and filter off the precipitated acid. Dissolve the crude acid in an excess 
of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, filter off any insoluble material 
(probably o-toluamide, m.p. 141 °C) through a sintered glass funnel while still 
hot and acidify the filtrate with dilute sulphuric acid. Collect the o-toluic acid 
on a Buchner funnel, dry in the air and recrystallise from benzene [or better 
toluene (CAUTION) -fume cupboard]. The yield of pure o-toluic acid, m.p. 
102-103 °C, is 200 g (78%). 

Method B (basic hydrolysis). Boil a mixture of 5 g of o-tolunitrile, 80 ml of 10 
per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and 15 ml of alcohol under a 

1063 



6.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



reflux condenser; the alcohol is added to increase the rate of hydrolysis. The 
solution becomes clear after heating for about 1 hour, but continue the 
boiling for a total period of 1.5 hours to ensure complete hydrolysis. Detach 
the condenser and boil the solution for a few minutes in the open flask to 
remove dissolved ammonia and some of the alcohol (CAUTION). Cool, and 
add concentrated hydrochloric acid until precipitation of the o-toluic acid is 
complete. When cold, filter off the o-toluic acid with suction and wash with a 
little cold water. Recrystallise from benzene (or toluene). The yield of o-toluic 
acid, m.p. 102-103 °C, is 5 g (86%). 

The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) shows signals at S 2.65 (s, 3H, Me), 
7.08-7.50 (m, 3H, C 4 , 5 ,6— H), 8.03 (m, 2H, ortho-H's to C0 2 H), and 11.69 
(s, 1H, OH). This should be contrasted with the p.m.r. spectrum (TFA, TMS) 
of p-toluic acid (cognate preparation below) which shows signals at S 2.47 
(s, 3H, Me), 7.30 (d, 2H, ortho-H's to Me), and 8.02 (d, 2H, ortho-H's, to C0 2 H); 
the hydroxyl proton is obscured by the TFA solvent. The m.s. of the isomers 
are similar, but with some differences in the RA of particular ions arising from 
the ortho effect (p. 383); the ortho isomer gives principal fragment ions at m/z 
136 (M), 119 (M - OH), 118 (M - H 2 0, base peak), 91 (M - C0 2 H), 90 
(118 - CO), and 65 (91 - C 2 H 2 ). 

Cognate preparations. p-Toluic acid may be similarly prepared by either 
Method A or Method B using p-tolunitrile (Expt 6.76). The spectral features 
are noted in the main preparation above. 

1-Naphthoic acid (by Method A). In a 750-ml or 1 -litre flask equipped with a 
reflux condenser, place 50 g (0.327 mol) of 1-naphthonitrile (Expt 6.168), 
100 ml of glacial acetic acid, 100 ml of water and 100 ml of concentrated 
sulphuric acid. Heat in an oil bath at 1 15-120 °C for 1.5 hours: do not allow 
the temperature to rise above 120 °C as the 1-naphthoic acid formed tends to 
lose carbon dioxide at higher temperatures and the yield will be reduced. 
Dilute the cold reaction mixture, which contains much crystalline solid, with 
an equal volume of water and filter at the pump; if the product consists of 
large lumps, transfer it first to a glass mortar and thoroughly grind it to a fine 
paste. Wash with water until free from mineral acid. Dissolve the crude acid 
in dilute aqueous sodium carbonate solution, heat for a short time to separate 
the resinous impurities and filter the hot solution. Acidify the clear filtrate 
with a slight excess of dilute sulphuric acid and collect the voluminous 
precipitate of almost pure 1-naphthoic acid, wash until free from inorganic 
salts and dry at 100 °C. Recrystallise from toluene or from light petroleum 
(b.p. 80-100 °C). The yield of pure 1-naphthoic acid, m.p. 160-161 °C, is 50g 
(89%).

Cool the potassium cuprocyanide solution in ice, stir mechanically and add 
the damp cake of the diazonium compound in small portions whilst 
maintaining the temperature at 5-8 °C. Nitrogen is soon evolved and a red 
precipitate forms gradually. Continue the stirring for about 10 hours in the 
cold, heat slowly to the boiling point, add 125 g of potassium chloride, stir 
and allow to stand. Collect the orange crystals which separate by suction 
filtration; recrystallise first from water and then from ethanol; dry at 100 °C. 
The product is almost pure potassium 2-cyanonaphthalene-l-sulphonate.

formed (some of which sublimes from the reaction mixture) by suction 
filtration on a sintered glass funnel, wash well with water and dry at 100 °C;

Phthalimide. Method 1. Place 100 g (0.675 mol) of phthalic anhydride and 
105 ml of concentrated ammonia solution (d 0.88) in a 1-litre round- 
bottomed flask fitted with a wide air condenser (H: 10 mm in diameter). Heat 
on a sand bath, gradually at first until the mixture is in a state of quiet fusion 
and forms a homogeneous melt (the temperature reaches 300 °C in about 1.5- 
2 hours; all the water is evaporated during the first hour). Shake the flask 
occasionally during the heating and push down any material which sublimes 
into the condenser with a glass rod. Pour the contents of the flask while still 
hot into a porcelain basin, allow to cool and grind to a fine powder in 
a mortar. The phthalimide (95 g, 96%) is practically pure and melts at 233- 
234 °C. It may be recrystallised from ethanol, but the solubility is only slight 
(about 5%). 

Method 2. Intimately mix 99 g (0.67 mol) of pure phthalic anhydride and 20 g

6.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(0.33 mol) of urea, and place the mixture in a 1-litre, long-necked, round- 
bottomed flask. Heat the flask in an oil bath at 130-135 °C. When the 
contents have melted, effervescence commences and gradually increases in 
vigour: after 10-20 minutes, the mixture suddenly froths up to about three 
times the original volume (this is accompanied by a rise in temperature to 
150-160 °C) and becomes almost solid. Remove the heat from beneath the 
bath and allow to cool. Add about 80 ml of water to disintegrate the solid in 
the flask, filter at the pump, wash with a little water and then dry at 100 °C. 
The yield of phthalimide, m.p. 233 °C (i.e. it is practically pure), is 86 g (87%). 
If desired, the phthalimide may be recrystallised from 1200 ml of industrial 
spirit; the first crop consists of 34 g of m.p. 234 °C, but further quantities may 
be recovered from the mother-liquor. 

Phthalide. In a 1-litre three-necked flask stir 90g (1.37 mol) of a high quality 
zinc powder to a thick paste with a solution of 0.5 g of crystallised copper(n) 
sulphate in 20 ml of water (this serves to activate the zinc), and then add 165 ml 
of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. Cool the flask in an ice bath to 
5 °C, stir the contents mechanically and add 73.5 g (0.5 mol) of phthalimide in 
small portions at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 8 °C 
(about 30 minutes are required for the addition). Continue the stirring for 
half an hour, dilute with 200 ml of water, warm on a water bath until the 
evolution of ammonia ceases (about 3 hours) and concentrate to a volume of 
about 200 ml by distillation under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator). 
Filter, cool in ice and render the filtrate acid to Congo red paper with 
concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 75 ml are required). Much of the 
phthalide separates as an oil, but, in order to complete the lactonisation of the 
hydroxymethylbenzoic acid, boil for an hour: transfer while hot to a beaker. 
The oil solidifies on cooling to a hard red-brown cake. Leave overnight in an 
ice chest or refrigerator, and then filter at the pump. The crude phthalide 
contains much sodium chloride. Recrystallise it in 10 g portions from 750 ml 
of water: use the mother-liquor from the first crop for the recrystallisation of 
the subsequent portion. Filter each portion while hot, cool in ice below 5 °C, 
filter and wash with small quantities of ice-cold water. Dry in the air upon 
filter paper. The yield of phthalide (transparent plates), m.p. 72-73 °C, is 47 g 
(70%). 

o-Cyanomethylbenzoic acid. This preparation must be conducted in an efficient 
fume cupboard. Into a 1 -litre three-necked flask, provided with a mechanical 
stirrer and a thermometer, place 40 g (0.33 mol) of phthalide and 40 g 
(0.615 mol) of powdered potassium cyanide (CAUTION). Heat the stirred 
mixture to 180-190 °C (internal temperature) in an oil bath for 4-5 hours. 
Allow to cool, add 400 ml of distilled water and stir the mixture until all the 
solids are dissolved (about 1 hour). Filter off any unreacted phthalide. Add 
dilute hydrochloric acid (1:1) to the dark aqueous solution (CAUTION: 
hydrogen cyanide is evolved) until it becomes turbid (about 20 ml are 
required), and continue the addition until the solution is slightly acid: filter off 
any dark impurities which may separate. Neutralise the solution carefully 
with sodium hydrogen carbonate, add a few grams of decolourising carbon, 
stir the mixture for several minutes and filter. Acidify the nearly colourless 
filtrate with about 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, cool in ice and 
filter at the pump. The resulting o-cyanomethylbenzoic acid (36 g) melts at 



1066 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.13 



1 14-1 15 °C and is satisfactory for most purposes. It may be crystallised from 
benzene or glacial acetic acid, but with considerable loss. See Section 4.2.77 
for disposal of aqueous solutions containing alkaline cyanides. 

Homophthalic acid. Place a mixture of 25 g (0.155 mol) of o-cyanomethyl 
benzoic acid and 25 g of 50 per cent sulphuric acid in a 100-ml flask, heat the 
mixture on a boiling water bath for 10^12 hours and then pour it into twice 
its volume of ice and water. Filter the precipitate at the pump and dry in the 
air. The yield of crude homophthalic acid is 21 g. Recrystallise by dissolving it 
in 500 ml of boiling water, add decolourising carbon, filter the hot solution 
through a hot water funnel and cool the filtrate in an ice bath: collect the acid 
and dry at 100 °C. The yield of practically colourless acid, m.p. 181 °C, is 17 g 
(61%). The melting point depends upon the rate of heating; immersion of the 
capillary in a bath at 170 °C gives a m.p. of 182-183 °C. 

6.13.3 CARBOXYLATION OF THE AROMATIC RING SYSTEM 

In general a phenol will undergo direct carboxylation of the nucleus when the 
dry sodium salt is heated under pressure with carbon dioxide (the Kolbe- 
Schmidt reaction). Addition of the weakly electrophilic carbon dioxide is 
promoted by electron release from the oxyanionic site. With phenol itself the 
ultimate product is salicylic acid (o-hydroxybenzoic acid); predominantly ortho 
attack may be attributable to stabilisation of the transition state through 
chelation. 

OH 




A^COf

It is of interest to record that p-hydroxybenzoic acid may be prepared by the 
vigorous thermal rearrangement of potassium salicylate (Expt 6.157). 

The carboxylation reaction is particularly facile with di- and tri-hydric 
phenols. Thus 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (Expt 6.156) is readily obtained by 
passing carbon dioxide through a boiling aqueous solution of the potassium or 
sodium salt of resorcinol. 

The standard carboxylation reaction of a Grignard reagent (Section 5.1 1.3, p. 
673) is also applicable in the aromatic series. The similar carboxylation of 
organosodium or organolithium compounds is described in the preparation of 
p-toluic acid (Expt 6.158). The organosodium compound is prepared by the 
direct reaction of sodium metal with p-chlorotoluene; the organolithium 
compound is similarly obtained from p-bromotoluene and lithium metal. The 
preparation of m-chlorobenzoic acid (cognate preparation in Expt 6.158) 
illustrates an alternative preparation of the required organolithium compound 
by means of a transmetalation process between butyllithium and m- 
bromochlorotoluene.

Place lOOg (0.725 mol) of salicylic acid and 150 ml of water in a 20-cm 
porcelain dish and slowly stir in 60 g of potassium carbonate. Evaporate the 
solution on a steam bath to a thick, pasty solid; break this up into small 
pieces and dry at 105-1 10 °C for 2 hours. Finely grind the solid, dry for a 
further 2 hours at 105-1 10 °C and grind again to a fine powder. Transfer the 
powder (a mixture of potassium salicylate and potassium carbonate) to a 
500-ml round-bottomed flask fitted with an air condenser set for downward 
distillation and immersed in an oil bath. Heat the oil bath to 240 °C and 
maintain this temperature for 90 minutes, stirring the solid occasionally with 
a glass rod; phenol formed in the reaction distils out of the mixture. When the 
reaction is complete (1), transfer the contents of the flask while still hot to a 2- 
litre flask containing 1 litre of hot water; rinse the reaction flask with several 
portions of the hot solution. Acidify with concentrated hydrochloric acid 
(c. 75 ml are required), heat nearly to boiling, add 5 g of decolourising carbon, 
filter, cool and collect the brown solid by suction filtration. Concentrate the 
filtrate to about 300 ml cool and collect a second crop of the acid. Dissolve 
the crude acid in 300 ml of hot water, boil for a few minutes with 5g of 
decolourising carbon and filter. Cool the filtrate under the tap, filter the solid 
with suction, wash with 15 ml of cold water and dry. The yield of p- 
hydroxybenzoic acid, m.p. 21 1-212 °C, is 40 g (40%). The p.m.r. spectrum 
should be recorded and interpreted.

Note. (1) This may be determined roughly by treating a small test portion with 3-4 ml 
of hot water and acidifying with concentrated hydrochloric acid; the absence of a 
precipitate in the warm solution indicates the essential completeness of the reaction. 
Salicylic acid is sparingly soluble and p-hydroxybenzoic acid is relatively soluble 
under these conditions.

Method A (use of organosodium reagent). Equip a 250-ml, three-necked 
round-bottomed flask with a reflux condenser carrying a pressure-equalising 
dropping funnel to which is attached a calcium chloride guard-tube, a sealed 
stirrer unit and a thermometer combined with a gas inlet tube to allow the air 
in the apparatus assembly to be displaced by nitrogen (cf. p. 85). Introduce 
50 ml of dry light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C) and 4.6 g (0.2 mol) of sodium wire 
and pass a slow stream of nitrogen through the apparatus. Add 12.6 g 
(0.1 mol) of redistilled p-chlorotoluene (Expt 6.71) from the dropping funnel, 
while stirring vigorously, during 90 minutes: maintain the temperature at 
25 °C and continue stirring for a further 2 hours. Pour the reaction mixture 
on to 200 g of crushed Cardice in the form of a slurry with 200 ml of dry ether 
contained in a large beaker. After 30-45 minutes, while some of the solid 
carbon dioxide still remains, add water cautiously to destroy the excess 
of sodium and to dissolve the sodium salt of the acid. Separate the aqueous 
layer, extract it once with 50 ml of ether and warm the aqueous solution on a 
boiling water bath to remove the dissolved solvent. Filter if necessary, and 
acidify the aqueous solution with dilute hydrochloric acid. Collect the 
precipitated acid by suction filtration, wash it with a little water and dry at 
100 °C. The yield of p-toluic acid, m.p. 175-176 °C, is 9.8 g (72%). 

Method B (use of organolithium reagent). Fit a 250-ml three-necked flask with 
a reflux condenser, protected with a calcium chloride guard-tube, a sealed 
mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel combined with a T-connection to 
provide for the inlet of nitrogen. 

Place 35 ml of anhydrous ether in the flask, displace the air by nitrogen 
and continue passing the nitrogen in a slow stream throughout the duration 
of the experiment. Introduce 1.90 g (0.274 mol) of lithium in the form of fine 
shavings (1) into the ether and start the stirrer. Place a solution of 21.5 g 
(0.125 mol) of p-bromotoluene (Expt 6.72) in 35 ml of ether in the dropping 
funnel. Run in about 1 ml of the solution into the stirred mixture. The ether in 
the flask soon becomes turbid; if the ether does not reflux within 10 minutes, 
immerse the flask in a beaker of warm water and remove it immediately 
refluxing commences. Add the remainder of the p-bromotoluene solution 
dropwise or at such a rate that the solvent refluxes continuously (60-90 
minutes). Stir the mixture while refluxing gently (warm water bath) for a 
further 45-60 minutes; at the end of this period most of the lithium will have 
disappeared. Cool the reaction mixture in ice-water, dilute it with 50-60 ml of 
anhydrous ether and cool (with stirring) to about — 50 °C with the aid of an 
acetone-Cardice bath. Pour the contents of the flask slowly and with stirring 
(use a long glass rod) on to 200 g of crushed Cardice in the form of a slurry 
with 200 ml of dry ether contained in a large beaker. Rinse the flask with a 

1069 



6.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



little of the solid carbon dioxide-ether slurry and add the rinsings to the 
contents of the beaker. Allow the Cardice to evaporate (3-4 hours or 
preferably overnight). Add about 200 ml of water to the contents of the 
beaker; rinse the reaction flask with 10 ml of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution and pour the rinsings into the beaker. A white solid appears which 
dissolves upon stirring. (If most of the ether has evaporated on standing, add 
a further 50 ml.) Separate the two layers, extract the aqueous solution with 
50 ml of ether (to remove traces of neutral products) and combine the extract 
with the ether layer. Shake the combined ethereal solutions with 10 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution and add the alkaline extract to the aqueous layer. 
Warm the combined aqueous layers to 60-70 °C (water bath) to drive off the 
dissolved ether, then cool to about 5 °C and strongly acidify with hydroch- 
loric acid. Collect the precipitated p-toluic acid by suction filtration and wash 
it with a little cold water. The yield of the crude acid, m.p. 174-176 °C, is 
11.9g (70%); recrystallisation from dilute alcohol gives pure p-toluic acid, 
m.p. 176-177 °C. 

Evaporate the dried ethereal extract; the residue, m.p. 85-90 °C, weighs 
3.3 g. Recrystallise it from alcohol: pure di-p-tolyl ketone, m.p. 95 °C, is 
obtained. 

Note. (1) A convenient method of preparing the lithium shavings is as follows. Place a 
piece of lithium weighing about 3 g and slightly moist with paraffin oil on a dry surface 
(slate or tiles) and pound it with a clean hammer or 500-g weight into a thin sheet 
about 0.5 mm thick. Cut the sheet into thin strips about 2-3 mm wide and transfer it to 
a beaker containing anhydrous ether. Weigh out the quantity of lithium required 
under dry ether or paraffin oil. Dry each strip with filter paper, cut it by means of a 
pair of scissors into small pieces about 1 mm wide and allow the small pieces to fall 
directly into the anhydrous ether in the reaction flask. The lithium thus retains its 
bright lustre. 

The lithium may also be pressed into wire of about 0.5 mm diameter; a rather 
sturdy press is necessary. The wire may be collected directly in sodium-dried ether. 

Cognate preparation. m-Chlorobenzok acid. Prepare a solution of butyllith- 
ium in anhydrous ether as follows. 

Place 100 ml of sodium-dried ether in a 500-ml three-necked flask 
equipped as in Method A. Displace the air and maintain a slow stream of 
nitrogen throughout the experiment. Introduce 4.3 g (0.62 mol) of fine lithium 
shavings into the reaction flask. Place a solution of 34.5 g (26.5 ml, 0.25 mol) 
of butyl bromide (Expt 5.54) in 50 ml of anhydrous ether in the dropping 
funnel, start the stirrer and run in 1-2 ml of the solution into the reaction flask 
cooled to about — 10 °C (Cardice-acetone bath). The reaction has commen- 
ced when bright spots appear on the lithium and the reaction mixture 
becomes slightly cloudy. Add the remainder of the butyl bromide solution 
during about 30 minutes while the internal temperature is maintained at 
about — 10 °C. Then allow the reaction mixture to warm up to 0-10 °C 
during 1 hour (with stirring) in order to complete the formation of 
butyllithium (1). 

Cool the solution of butyllithium to — 35 °C in a Cardice-acetone bath 
and add, while stirring vigorously, a solution of 48 g of m- 
bromochlorobenzene (Expt 6.72) in 75 ml of anhydrous ether. Stir for 15 
minutes and pour the mixture with stirring on to a large excess of solid 
carbon dioxide in the form of a Cardice-ether slurry contained in a large 



1070 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.13 



beaker. Isolate the acid as detailed above for p-toluic acid and recrystallise it 
from hot water. The yield of m-chlorobenzoic acid, m.p. 150-151 °C, is 27 g. 

Note. (1) If a clear solution of butyllithium is required for any purpose, it may be 
decanted through a glass wool plug as detailed under 2-phenylpyridine [Expt 8.32, 
Note (2)]. 

6.13.4 NUCLEAR NITRATION OF AROMATIC CARBOXYLIC ACIDS AND ESTERS 

The carboxyl and alkoxycarbonyl groups exert an electron-withdrawing 
influence when attached to the aromatic ring system, and are thus deactivating 
and meta directing in electrophilic substitution reactions. Electrophilic substi- 
tution is illustrated by the nitration of methyl benzoate (Expt 6.159) and of 
benzoic acid and phenylacetic acid (Expt 6.160). In the former instance nitration 
is effected with 'mixed acid' at a temperature below 15 °C, conditions which 
effect monosubstitution. The resulting methyl m-nitrobenzoate may be hydroly- 
sed to the corresponding nitro acid with aqueous alkali. Nitration of benzoic 
acid with a hot mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid and fuming nitric acid 
results in substitution in both meta positions to yield 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid. 
Dinitration of phenylacetic acid is achieved using fuming nitric acid alone, the 
directive influence of the — CH 2 - C0 2 H group is to the ortho and para positions. 

Experiment 6.159 m-NITROBENZOIC ACID 

Ph-C0 2 Me -^* m-0 2 N-C 6 H 4 -C0 2 Me ^&gt; m-0 2 N-C 6 H 4 -C0 2 H 

Methyl m-nitrobenzoate. In a 1-litre, round-bottomed three-necked flask, 
fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer, place 102 g (94 ml, 
0.74 mol) of pure methyl benzoate (Expt 6.163). Prepare a mixture of 62.5 ml 
of concentrated sulphuric acid and 62.5 ml of concentrated nitric acid in a 
dropping funnel, cool the flask in an ice bath to 0-10 °C and then run in the 
nitrating mixture, with stirring, while maintaining the temperature of the 
reaction mixture between 5 and 15 °C; the addition requires about 1 hour. 
Continue the stirring for 15 minutes longer, and pour the mixture upon 700 g 
of crushed ice. Filter off the crude methyl m-nitrobenzoate at the pump and 
wash it with cold water. Transfer the solid to a 500-ml bolt-head flask and stir 
it with 100 ml of ice-cold methanol in order to remove a small amount of the 
ortho isomer and other impurities. Filter the cooled mixture with suction, 
wash it with 50 ml of ice-cold methanol and dry in the air. The practically 
colourless methyl m-nitrobenzoate weighs 1 15 g (84%) and melts at 75-76 °C; 
it is sufficiently pure for conversion into m-nitrobenzoic acid. The pure ester, 
m.p. 78 °C, may be obtained by recrystallisation from an equal weight of 
methanol. 

Hydrolysis of methyl m-nitrobenzoate to m-nitrobenzoic acid. Place 90.5 g 
(0.5 mol) of methyl m-nitrobenzoate and a solution of 40 g of sodium 
hydroxide in 160 ml of water in a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask equipped with 
a reflux condenser. Heat the mixture to boiling during 5-10 minutes or until 
the ester has disappeared. Dilute the reaction mixture with an equal volume 
of water. When cold pour the diluted reaction product, with vigorous stirring, 
into 125 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Allow to cool to room 

1071 



6.13 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



temperature, filter the crude acid at the pump and wash it with a little water. 
Upon drying at 100 °C, the crude m-nitrobenzoic acid, which has a pale 
brownish colour, weighs 80g (96%) and melts at 140 °C. Recrystallisation 
from 1 per cent hydrochloric acid affords the pure acid, m.p. 141 °C, as a pale 
cream solid; the loss of material is about 5 per cent. 

The p.m.r. spectra of m-nitrobenzoic acid (CDC1 3 + TFA) and its ester 
(CDC1 3 ) should be recorded and the signals assigned appropriately.

CAUTION: This preparation must be carried out in the fume cupboard since 
nitrous fumes are evolved. 

Dissolve 50 g (0.41 mol) of pure benzoic acid in 230 ml of concentrated 
sulphuric acid in a litre flask equipped with a reflux condenser. Add 73 ml of 
fuming nitric acid (d 1.5) a few ml at a time (CAUTION). Shake the flask well 
and cool in ice-water during the addition; much heat is evolved and a clear 
yellow solution results. Add a few fragments of porous porcelain and heat the 
mixture gradually on a water bath to 100 °C during 45 minutes. At 70-80 °C 
the reaction may (and usually does) become vigorous; moderate, when 
necessary, by cooling the flask in cold water. Maintain the mixture at 100 °C 
for 15 minutes with occasional shaking, and then transfer it to an oil bath at 
100 °C; raise the temperature to 130°C over 30 minutes and keep it at 130- 
140 °C for 1 hour. Allow the flask to cool: crystals commence to separate at 
about 90 °C. When cold, pour the reaction mixture into 3-4 litres of ice- water, 
filter the separated crystals, wash with water and dry. The yield of 3,5- 
dinitrobenzoic acid, m.p. 204 °C, is 50 g (57%): this acid is pure enough for 
most purposes. Upon recrystallisation from 50 per cent alcohol (4.5 ml per 
gram), the m.p. is raised to 207 °C. 

Cognate preparation. 2,4-Dinitrophenylacetic acid. Place 25 g (0.1 84 mol) of 
phenylacetic acid (Expt 5.128) in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask, cool the 
latter in running water and add from a suitably supported dropping funnel 
250 ml of fuming nitric acid, rather slowly at first and then more rapidly. The 
addition occupies about 15 minutes. Attach a reflux condenser to the flask 
and heat the mixture under reflux for 1 hour, and then carefully pour the 
cooled solution into 500 ml of cold water. When cold, filter the crude product 
at the pump and wash it with a little cold water: the resulting acid, after 
drying at 100 °C, is almost pure (m.p. 181 °C) and weighs 31 g. Recrystallise it 
from 300 ml of 20 per cent ethanol. Collect the first main crop (25 g), and 
allow the mother-liquor to stand overnight when a further 2 g of pure acid is 
obtained; dry at 100 °C. The yield of pure 2,4-dinitrophenylacetic acid, m.p. 
183 °C, is 27 g (64%). 

6.13.5 SOME METHODS FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE CARBOXYL GROUP 

The esterification procedures suitable for the protection of aliphatic carboxylic 
acids (Section 5.1 1.8, p. 690) are equally applicable in the aromatic series. These 
methods for protection, and the methods for deprotection are exemplified under 

1072 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.U 



aliphatic acids and further illustrated in Sections 6.14.3, p. 1076, 9.6.15, p. 1261 
and 9.6.17, p. 1266. 



6.14 AROMATIC CARBOXYLIC ACID DERIVATIVES 

1. Acid halides (Expt 6.161). 

2. Acid anhydrides (Expt 6.162). 

3. Esters (Expts 6.163 to 6.166). 

4. Acid amides (Expt 6.167). 

The structural interrelationships of these aromatic carboxylic acid deriva- 
tives and the retrosynthetic analyses that indicate the broad methods of 
synthesis are similar to the aliphatic analogues. The methods of preparation 
described in these sections are those which appear to work best in the aromatic 
field. 

SPECTROSCOPIC FEATURES 

All these derivatives show strong i.r. absorption arising from the stretching 
vibration of the carbonyl group. They may be distinguished from each other by 
inspection of the appropriate region for absorption arising from the carbonyl- 
bound halogen, acyloxy, alkyloxy, or amino groups (p. 296). The p.m.r. spectra 
provide predictable evidence for the pattern of aromatic substitution, for the 
structure of the alkyl group and for the presence of nitrogen-bound hydrogens. 
Suitable orf/w-substituted compounds give expected fragmentation patterns in 
the m.s. (p. 383). Further descriptive analyses of the spectra of specific 
compounds are given in the preparative examples below. 

6.14.1 ACID HALIDES 

General methods for the preparation of acid halides from aliphatic carboxylic 
acids are described in Section 5.12.1, p. 692. Phosphorus pentachloride is the 
preferred chlorinating agent for aromatic acids which contain electron- 
withdrawing substituents, and which do not react readily with thionyl chloride. 
The preparation of both p-nitrobenzoyl chloride and 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl 
chloride is described in Expt 6.161. These particular acid chlorides are valuable 
reagents for the characterisation of aliphatic alcohols and simple phenols, with 
which they form crystalline esters (see Section 9.6.4, p. 1241 and Section 9.6.6, 
p. 1248). 

Experiment 6.161 ^-NITROBENZOYL CHLORIDE 

/&gt;-0 2 N-C 6 H 4 -C0 2 H + PC1 5 &gt; p-0 2 N-C 6 H 4 -COCl + POCl 3 + HC1 

Mix 100 g (0.6 mol) of pure p-nitrobenzoic acid (Expt 6.149) and 126 g 
(0.6 mol) of pure phosphorus pentachloride in a 500-ml round-bottomed 
flask. Fit the flask with a calcium chloride guard-tube and connect the latter 
to a gas absorption device (e.g. Fig. 2.61). Heat the flask on a water bath, with 
occasional shaking, until the reaction commences and then for a further 30 
minutes or until the vigorous evolution of hydrogen chloride has almost 
ceased: a pale yellow homogeneous liquid is formed. Attach a Claisen still- 

1073 



6.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



head connected with a water-cooled condenser, and remove the phosphorus 
oxychloride (b.p. 107 °C) at ordinary pressure either by heating in an oil bath 
gradually to 200-220 °C or by heating in an air bath until the boiling point is 
about 150 °C. Allow to cool, replace the water condenser by a short air-cooled 
condenser and distil the residual liquid under reduced pressure (water pump) 
(1). A small quantity of phosphorus oxychloride passes over first and the 
temperature rises rapidly to about 150°C/20mmHg; change the receiver and 
collect the p-nitrobenzoyl chloride at 155°C/20mmHg. Pour the product 
while still fluid into a small wide-mouthed bottle and allow it to solidify: this 
prevents any moisture in the air from decomposing more than the surface 
layer of acid chloride. The yield of p-nitrobenzoyl chloride (a yellow 
crystalline solid, m.p. 71 °C) is 105 g (95%) and is pure enough for most 
purposes. A perfectly pure product, m.p. 73 °C, is obtained by recrystallising 
from carbon tetrachloride. 

Note. (1) Either an oil bath (maintained at 210-215 °C for a pressure of 20 mmHg) or 
an air bath must be used. If the flask is heated with a free flame, superheating will 
occur leading to decomposition (sometimes violent) of the p-nitrobenzoyl chloride. 

Cognate preparations. 3,5-Dinitrobenzoyl chloride. Place a mixture of 30 g 
(0.141 mol) of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid (Expt 6.160) and 33 g (0.158 mol) of 
phosphorus pentachloride in a round-bottomed flask: fit a reflux condenser, 
and heat the mixture in an oil bath at 120-130 °C for 75 minutes. Allow to 
cool. Remove the phosphorus oxychloride by distillation under reduced 
pressure (25 °C/20 mmHg); raise the temperature of the bath to 110°C. The 
residual 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride solidifies on cooling to a brown mass; the 
yield is quantitative. Recrystallise from carbon tetrachloride: the yield is 25 g 
(77%), m.p. 67-68 °C, and this is satisfactory for most purposes. Further 
recrystallisation from a large volume of light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C, gives a 
perfectly pure product, m.p. 69.5 °C. 

3,5-Dinitrobenzoyl chloride reacts readily with water and it should be kept 
in sealed tubes or under light petroleum. When required for the preparation 
of derivatives it is usually best prepared in small quantities from 3,5- 
dinitrobenzoic acid immediately before use. 

2-Naphthoyl chloride. This compound may be prepared from 57.4 g 
(0.33 mol) of 2-naphthoic acid and 69 g (0.33 mol) of phosphorus penta- 
chloride following the procedure described above for p-nitrobenzoyl chloride. 
After removing the phosphorus oxychloride by distillation, the product is 
collected as a fraction of b.p. 160-162 °C/1 1 mmHg. This solidifies on cooling 
to a colourless solid, m.p. 51-52°C; The yield is 60 g (95%). 

CAUTION: The preparation of o-nitrobenzoyl chloride, o-nitrophenacetyl 
chloride and all o-nitroacid chlorides should not be attempted by the above 
methods: a violent explosion may occur upon distilling the product. 

6.14.2 ACID ANHYDRIDES 

o-Dicarboxylic acids (e.g. phthalic acid) readily form intramolecular anhydrides 
on heating. In Expt 6.162 the nitration of phthalic anhydride to yield a mixture 
of the isomeric 3- and 4-nitrophthalic acids is described, which can be separated 
by fractional crystallisation from water. The 3-nitrophthalic acid is efficiently 



1074 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.14 



converted into the corresponding anhydride by warming with acetic anhydride 
and allowing the product to crystallise. 

Phthalic anhydrides readily form hydrogen phthalate esters on reaction with 
alcohols; the derivatives from 3-nitrophthalic anhydride are usually nicely 
crystalline compounds and are hence suitable for purposes of characterisation. 
Hydrogen phthalate esters are also useful in appropriate instances for the 
resolution of racemic alcohols (Section 5.19). 

Experiment 6.162 3-NITROPHTHALIC ANHYDRIDE 

O 




CAUTIONARY NOTE: The nitration of phthalic anhydride has been 
reported to proceed with explosive violence. 60 * The reaction may be carried out 
with safety on the scale adopted here provided that strict attention to detail is 
paid to the rate of addition of the acid and to the control of the temperature. A 
modified procedure for use in large-scale nitration has been published. 60h 

3-Nitrophthalic acid. Equip a 500-ml, three-necked round-bottomed flask, 
supported on a water bath, with a dropping funnel, a thermometer and a 
stirrer supported in the central (open) neck connected by means of a flexible 
drive to a stirrer motor. The latter should not be sited near the open neck 
since the nitrous fumes evolved in the subsequent reaction may otherwise 
cause damage. Place 100 g (0.675 mol) of technical phthalic anhydride and 
100 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid in the flask and heat it until the 
temperature of the mixture rises to 80 °C. Remove the water bath, and add a 
mixture of 42 ml of fuming nitric acid (d 1.5) and 30 ml of concentrated 
sulphuric acid slowly from the dropping funnel at such a rate as to maintain 
the temperature of the stirred mixture at 100-1 10 °C (about 1 hour). Then 
add 180 ml of concentrated nitric acid (d 1.42) as rapidly as possible without 
causing the temperature to rise above 1 10 °C. Heat the mixture on the water 
bath, with stirring, for 2 hours. Allow the reaction mixture to stand overnight 
and then pour it into 300 ml of water contained in a 2-litre beaker. Cool and 
filter the mixture of 3- and 4-nitrophthalic acids through a sintered glass 
funnel. Return the wet cake of acids to the rinsed-out beaker and stir it 
thoroughly with 40 ml of water, which dissolves a large amount of the 4- 
nitrophthalic acid (1). Filter again at the pump and dissolve the solid in 40- 
60 ml of boiling water; filter the hot solution and stir until crystallisation 

1075 



6.14 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



commences and then leave overnight until crystallisation is complete. Filter 
again with suction and dry upon filter paper. The yield of crude 3- 
nitrophthalic acid, m.p. 208-210 °C (sealed tube), is 44 g. Recrystallisation 
from about 100 ml of boiling water (2) gives about 36 g (25%) of the pure acid, 
m.p. 216-218 °C (sealed tube). 

Notes. (1) The mother-liquors from the washings and recrystallisations are saved for 
the recovery of 4-nitrophthalic acid. The combined mother-liquors are concentrated 
to small bulk and the organic acids extracted into ether. Upon esterification of the 
residue after evaporation of the ether by the Ftscher-Speier method (Section 5.12.3, p. 
695), the 3-nitro acid forms the acid ester and may be removed by shaking the product 
with sodium carbonate solution, while the 4-nitrophthalic acid yields the neutral 
diester. Hydrolysis of the neutral ester gives the pure 4-nitrophthalic acid, m.p. 165 °C. 
(2) The acid may also be recrystallised from glacial acetic acid. 

3-Nitrophthalic anhydride. In a 100-ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a 
reflux condenser, place 2 1 g (0. 1 mol) of 3-nitrophthalic acid and 20 g ( 1 8.5 ml, 
0.2 mol) of redistilled acetic anhydride. Heat the mixture to gentle boiling 
until a clear solution is obtained, and then for about 10 minutes longer. Pour 
the hot mixture (fume cupboard) into a large porcelain dish and allow to 
cool. Grind the crystalline mass thoroughly in a mortar and filter at the pump 
through a sintered glass funnel. Return the crystals to the mortar, grind them 
with 15 ml of sodium-dried ether and filter. Again return the crystals to the 
mortar and wash once more with 15 ml of dry, alcohol-free ether. Dry in air 
for a short time, and then to constant weight at 100 °C. The yield of 3- 
nitrophthalic anhydride, m.p. 163-164 °C, is 17 g (88%). If the m.p. is 
unsatisfactory, recrystallise the anhydride from benzene or from benzene- 
light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C). 

6.14.3 ESTERS 

Aromatic esters may be prepared by direct esterification methods similar to 
those already described for aliphatic esters (Section 5.12.3, p. 695). A large range 
of examples of simple alkyl esters of aromatic carboxylic acids is included in 
Expt 6.163. Corresponding esterification of a simple aliphatic acid (e.g. acetic 
acid) with benzyl alcohol is illustrated in Expt 5.142. 

Methyl esters may be prepared by reaction of the aromatic carboxylic acid 
with diazomethane (cf. Section 4.2.25, p. 433) or, more conveniently, by reaction 
with a boron trifluoride-methanol reagent. The latter procedure is illustrated by 
the preparation of methyl m-chlorobenzoate and dimethyl terephthalate (Expt 
6.164). t-Butyl esters may be prepared by conversion of the acid into an N- 
acylimidazole by reaction with N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, followed by reaction 
with t-butyl alcohol in the presence of DBU 62 (Expt 6.165). 

Esterification of aromatic carboxylic acids with phenols, however, cannot be 
accomplished by a direct esterification procedure and resort must be made to 
the greater reactivity exhibited by the acid chlorides. Reaction is usually carried 
out in dilute aqueous alkali (Schotten-Baumann conditions, Section 6.6.2, pp. 
916 and 1248). The preparation of 2-naphthyl benzoate is a typical example of 
this procedure (Expt 6.166). 

The preparation of a carboxylic ester by a variant of the Grignard 
carboxylation route has been described. 61 The arylmagnesium bromide is first 
prepared and added to an excess of diethyl carbonate, conditions which

minimise the possibility of further reaction of the Grignard reagent with the 
ester initially produced to form the tertiary alcohol.

Experiment 6.163 METHYL BENZOATE 

Ph-C0 2 H + MeOH -^ Ph-C0 2 Me + H 2 

In a 500-ml round-bottomed flask place a mixture of 30 g (0.246 mol) of 
benzoic acid, 80 g (101 ml, 2.5 mol) of absolute methanol and 5g (2.7 ml) of 
concentrated sulphuric acid. Add a few small chips of porous porcelain, 
attach a reflux condenser and boil the mixture gently for 4 hours (1). Distil off 
the excess of alcohol on a water bath (rotary evaporator) and allow to cool. 
Pour the residue into about 250 ml of water contained in a separatory funnel 
and rinse the flask with a few ml of water which are also poured into the 
separatory funnel. If, owing to the comparatively slight difference between the 
density of the ester and of water, difficulty is experienced in obtaining a sharp 
separation of the lower ester layer and water, add 10-15 ml of carbon 
tetrachloride (2) and shake the mixture in the funnel vigorously; upon 
standing, the heavy solution of methyl benzoate in the carbon tetrachloride 
separates sharply and rapidly at the bottom of the separatory funnel. Run off 
the lower layer carefully, reject the upper aqueous layer, return the methyl 
benzoate to the funnel and shake it with a strong solution of sodium 
hydrogen carbonate until all free acid is removed and no further evolution of 
carbon dioxide occurs. Wash once with water, and dry by pouring into a 
small dry conical flask containing about 5 g of magnesium sulphate. Stopper 
the flask, shake for about 5 minutes and allow to stand for at least half an 
hour with occasional shaking. Filter the methyl benzoate solution through a 
small fluted filter paper directly into a round-bottomed flask fitted with a 
still-head carrying a 360 °C thermometer and an air condenser. Add a few 
boiling chips and distil from an air bath; raise the temperature slowly at first 
until all carbon tetrachloride has passed over and then heat more strongly. 
Collect the methyl benzoate (a colourless liquid) at 198-200 °C. The yield is 
31g(92%). 

Notes. (1) Slightly improved results may be obtained by increasing the time of 

heating. 

(2) Alternatively, the ester may be extracted with two 50 ml portions of ether. The 

ethereal solution is washed with concentrated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution 

(handle the separatory funnel cautiously as carbon dioxide is evolved) until 

effervescence ceases, then with water, and dried over magnesium sulphate. The ether is 

removed by flash distillation and the residual ester distilled. 

Cognate preparations. [The p.m.r. spectra (CDC1 3 or CC1 4 , TMS) of the 
ethyl, propyl and butyl esters should be recorded and interpreted, since the 
signals corresponding to the protons of these alkyl groups, afford good 
examples of the (N + 1)(M + 1) rule for multiplicity (p. 341).]

acid, 1 15 g (145 ml, 2.5 mol) of absolute ethanol and 5g (2.7 ml) of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid. Reflux the mixture for 4 hours and work up as for 
methyl benzoate. The yield of ethyl benzoate, b.p. 212-214 °C, is 32 g (86%). 

Propyl benzoate. Into a 500-ml round-bottomed flask place 30 g (0.246 mol) 
of benzoic acid, 30g (37.5 ml, 0.5mol) of propan-1-ol, 50 ml of sodium-dried 
toluene and 10 g (5.4 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid. Reflux the mixture 
for 10 hours. Pour the reaction product into about 250 ml of water, and 
extract with ether. Wash the ethereal extract with saturated sodium hydrogen 
carbonate solution and then with water: dry over magnesium sulphate. Distil 
off the ether and some of the toluene through a fractionating column, and 
distil the residue from a Claisen flask. Collect the propyl benzoate at 229- 
230 °C. The yield is 37 g (91%). 

Butyl benzoate. Use 30 g (0.246 mol) of benzoic acid, 37 g (46 ml, 0.5 mol) of 
butan-1-ol, 50 ml of sodium-dried toluene and 10 g (5.4 ml) of concentrated 
sulphuric acid, and reflux the mixture for 12 hours. Work up the product as 
for propyl benzoate; after the ether and toluene have been removed with the 
aid of a rotary evaporator, distil the residue under reduced pressure. The yield 
of butyl benzoate, b.p. 1 19-120 °C/llmmHg, is 35 g (80%). 

Methyl salicylate. Use 28 g (0.2 mol) of salicylic acid, 64 g (81 ml, 2 mol) of 
dry methanol and 8 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. Reflux the mixture for 
at least 5 hours and work up as for methyl benzoate. Collect the pure methyl 
salicylate (a colourless oil of delightful fragrance, 'oil of wintergreen') at 221- 
224 °C; the yield is 25 g (81%). The ester may also be distilled under reduced 
pressure; the b.p. is 1 15 °C/20 mmHg and a 2 °C fraction should be collected. 

Ethyl salicylate. This colourless ester, b.p. 231-234 °C, is similarly obtained 
in 75 per cent yield from salicylic acid, ethanol and sulphuric acid as catalyst. 
It is best to distil the ester under reduced pressure; the boiling points under 
various pressures are given in Table 2.10. 

Methyl cinnamate. Use 59g (0.4mol) of cinnamic acid (Expt 6.138), 128g 
(162 ml, 4mol) of absolute methanol and 6ml of concentrated sulphuric acid; 
reflux the mixture for 5 hours. Remove excess methanol, pour the residue into 
about 500 ml of water and add 300 ml of ether. Separate, wash and dry the 
ether solution in the usual way. Remove the ether on a rotary evaporator; the 
residue crystallises on cooling, yielding 58 g (90%) of methyl cinnamate, m.p. 
33-34 °C. To obtain a pure specimen, m.p. 36 °C, dissolve a sample in the 
minimum of methanol maintained at 30 °C in a water bath, and add water 
slowly from a dropping pipette with stirring until the oily ester just begins to 
separate. Seed the solution and transfer rapidly to an ice bath with a glass 
rod, scratching the sides of the vessel vigorously with a glass rod. Filter the 
resulting colourless needles rapidly. 

Ethyl nicotinate {ethyl pyridine-3-carboxylate). Reflux a mixture of 37 g 
(0.3 mol) pure nicotinic acid (Expt 6.150), 92g (115ml, 2mol) of absolute 
ethanol and 90 g (50 ml) of concentrated sulphuric acid on a steam bath. Cool 
the solution and pour it slowly and with stirring on to 200 g of crushed ice. 
Add sufficient ammonia solution to render the resulting solution strongly 
alkaline: generally, some ester separates as an oil but most of it remains 
dissolved in the alkaline solution. Extract the mixture with five 25 ml portions 

1078 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.14 



of ether, dry the combined ethereal extracts over magnesium sulphate, 
remove the ether by flash distillation and distil the residue under reduced 
pressure. The ethyl nicotinate distils at 1 1 7- 1 1 8 °C/ 1 6 mmHg; the yield is 32 g 
(71%). The boiling point under atmospheric pressure is 222-224 °C.

Place 9.4 g (0.06 mol) of m-chlorobenzoic acid and 66 ml (0.12mol) of 
boron trifluoride-methanol complex (14% w/v of BF 3 ; Section 4.2.8, p. 421) 
in a 250-ml round-bottomed flask. Heat the mixture under reflux on an oil 
bath for 2 hours, cool and pour into about 250 ml of saturated sodium 
hydrogen carbonate solution. Extract the organic product with three 50 ml 
portions of ether, dry the ethereal extract over magnesium sulphate and 
evaporate on a rotary evaporator. Distil the residue under reduced pressure 
and collect the methyl m-chlorobenzoate as a colourless liquid of b.p. 
63°C/3mmHg; the yield is 9.3 g (91%). 

Cognate preparation. Dimethyl terephthalate. Use 9.97 g (0.06 mol) of 
terephthalic acid, 132 ml of boron trifluoride-methanol complex (14% w/v) 
and 100 ml of dry methanol (1) and heat the mixture under reflux for 6 hours. 
Cool the reaction mixture and pour into excess (500 ml) of saturated sodium 
hydrogen carbonate solution. Filter the precipitated dicarboxylic ester under 
suction and recrystallise from methanol. The yield is 9.8 g (84%); m.p. 139- 
140 °C. The p.m.r. spectrum (CDC1 3 , TMS) of this ester should be recorded 
and compared with those of the ortho and meta isomers. It should be noted 
that dimethyl terephthalate gives an A 4 pattern for the aromatic protons, the 
ortho isomer gives an A 2 B 2 splitting pattern, and the meta isomer shows 
signals at S 7.50 (t, 1H, C 5 — H), 8.19 (d of d, 2H, C 4 , 6 — H) and 8.63 (t, 1H, 
C 2 — H) for the aromatic region of the spectrum. 

Note. (1) Additional methanol is used in this case because of the low solubility of the 
di-acid and di-ester. Dry the methanol by distillation from magnesium (Section 4.1.5).

solution is highly coloured, add 1.5 g of decolourising carbon and filter the 
cold solution through a hardened filter paper. Pour the solution into a 100-ml 
conical flask and run in 7.0 g (5.8 ml, 0.05 mol) of benzoyl chloride. Stopper 
the flask and shake vigorously until the odour of benzoyl chloride has 
disappeared (10-15 minutes). Filter off the solid product on a Buchner funnel 
and wash it with a little cold water. Recrystallise it from about 60 ml of 
rectified spirit. Filter off the crystals which separate and dry them upon filter 
paper in the air. The yield of pure 2-naphthyl benzoate, m.p. 110°C, is 11 g 
(89%). 

6.14.4 ACID AMIDES 

The preparation of toluamide (Expt 6.167) illustrates a useful procedure for the 
conversion of aromatic nitriles into acid amides with the aid of alkaline 
hydrogen peroxides (see discussion, Section 5.12.4, p. 708). 

A further example of the preparation of amides by the ammonolysis of esters 
(cf. succinamide, Expt 5.155) is provided by the preparation of nicotinamide 
described in Expt 6.169 as a stage in the synthesis of 3-cyanopyridine. 

Experiment 6.167 o-TOLUAMIDE 

2 o-Me-C 6 H 4 -CN + 2H 2 2 ^&gt; 2 o-Me-C 6 H 4 -CO-NH 2 + 2 

Place 29 g (0.25 mol) of o-tolunitrile (Expt 6.76), 130 ml of rectified spirit (1) 
and 10 ml of 25 per cent sodium hydroxide solution in a 1-litre bolt-necked 
flask. Set up the flask inside an aluminium bowl placed on a magnetic 
stirrer/hotplate unit which is supported on an adjustable laboratory jack. 
Insert into the flask a magnetic stirrer follower and a thermometer, start the 
stirrer motor and run in steadily 100 ml of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide 
(CAUTION: see Section 4.2.41, p. 439 for precautions in the use of this 
reagent) (2). Oxygen is soon evolved and the mixture becomes warm; when 
the temperature approaches 40 °C add an ice-water slurry to the bowl in 
order that the temperature may be controlled within the 40-50 °C range. If 
the temperature tends to fall below this range it may be necessary to remove 
the cooling bath for a while. If the temperature is permitted to rise above 
50 °C not only may the evolution of oxygen become so rapid as to cause the 
mixture to foam out of the flask, but also there is a danger of a violent 
explosion due to the ignition of an oxygen-ethanol vapour mixture (3). The 
exothermic reaction is complete after about 1 hour and then the temperature 
of the reaction mixture is kept at 50 °C for a further 3 hours by external 
heating. While still warm, add 5 per cent sulphuric acid until exactly neutral 
to litmus, and remove the ethanol and concentrate the residue to about

AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.15 



200 ml under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Cool the residue to 
20 °C, filter off the crystals at the pump and grind them to a paste with 30 ml 
of cold water in a mortar. Filter again, wash the product in the filter with a 
further 30 ml of water and dry in the air upon filter paper. The yield of 
o-toluamide (white crystals), m.p. 141 °C, is 30 g (90%). It may be recrystallised 
from hot water (1 g per ml), but the m.p. is unchanged. 

Notes. (1) This volume of rectified spirit is required to produce a homogeneous 
solution. 

(2) Difficultly hydrolysable nitriles, such as o-tolunitrile, require 30 per cent hydrogen 
peroxide. For most nitriles, however, both aromatic and aliphatic, an equivalent 
amount of 6-12 per cent hydrogen peroxide gives more satisfactory results; the above 
procedure must, however, be modified, according to the solubility of the nitriles and 
amides. 

(3) To minimise this explosion danger, the reaction should be carried out in a well- 
ventilated fume cupboard in the absence of free flames; brisk stirring should be 
maintained throughout the exothermal stage.

This valuable method for the preparation of aryl nitriles via the diazonium salt

Expt 6.76.

6.15.2 THE DISPLACEMENT OF HALOGEN BY CYANIDE IN AN ARYL HALIDE 

The ready replacement of the halogen in an alkyl or an aralkyl halide illustrated 
in Expt 5.157 by reaction with sodium or potassium cyanide is inapplicable in 
the case of aryl halides wherein the halogen is relatively inert. However, aryl 
bromides can be converted into nitriles in good yield by heating them for several 
hours at about 200 °C with copper(i) cyanide in the presence of pyridine (e.g. 1- 
naphthonitrile, Expt 6.168). This displacement may be achieved more readily by 
using dimethylformamide as the solvent, when reaction is usually completed in a 
few hours at reflux temperature. 63

Place 80 g (54 ml, 0.386 mol) of redistilled 1-bromonaphthalene (Expt 6.125), 
43 g (0.48 mol) of dry powdered copper(i) cyanide (Section 4.2.25, p. 429) and 
36 g (37 ml, 0.457 mol) of dry pure pyridine (CAUTION) (1) (Section 4.1.29, 
p. 410) in a 250-ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser 
carrying a calcium chloride guard-tube, and heat the mixture in a metal bath 
at 215-225 °C for 15 hours (2). Pour the resulting dark brown solution while 
still hot (c. 100 °C) into a litre flask containing 180 ml of concentrated 
ammonia solution (d 0.88) and 180 ml of water. Add 170 ml of toluene 
(CAUTION), stopper the flask and shake until all the lumps have 
disintegrated. When cold, add 100 ml of ether and filter through a sintered 
glass funnel (3). Add a further 50 ml of ether, transfer to a separatory funnel, 
separate the ether-toluene layer and wash it successively with: (i) four 125 ml 
portions of dilute ammonia solution (or until the organic layer is colourless); 
(ii) two 125 ml portions of dilute hydrochloric acid (1:1) (any precipitate 
which separates should be filtered off); (iii) two 125 ml portions of water; and 
(iv) two 125 ml portions of saturated sodium chloride solution. Finally, dry 
with magnesium sulphate, remove the ether and toluene by distillation on a 
rotary evaporator and distil the residue under reduced pressure (water pump) 
through a short fractionating column (compare Fig. 2.108). Collect the 1- 
naphthonitrile at 166-169 °C/18mmHg as a colourless liquid. The yield is 
50 g (84%). 

Notes. (1) Much heat is liberated when pyridine is added to the mixture. 

(2) The metal bath may be replaced by a bath of Silicone oil. 

(3) The cuprammonium solution attacks filter paper. 

6.15.3 THE DEHYDRATION OF AMIDES AND ALDOXIMES 

Two examples of the dehydration of aromatic carboxamides using phosphorus 
pentoxide (cf. Section 5.13.3, p. 715) are given in Expt 6.169; these are the 
preparation of benzonitrile and 3-cyanopyridine. 

The one-pot conversion of an aromatic carboxylic acid into the correspond- 
ing nitrile may be effected by reaction with ammonia in the presence of ethyl 
polyphosphate 64 ; the initial stage is the formation of the amide and this is 
followed by dehydration to the nitrile. The reaction has been used successfully 
with a range of aromatic carboxylic acids. 

1082 



AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 6.15 



The indirect conversion of an aromatic aldehyde into the corresponding 
nitrile by dehydration of an oxime is illustrated by the synthesis of veratronitrile 
(Expt 6.170). The dehydrating agent is acetic anhydride which probably effects 
an initial acetylation of the oximino group followed by the elimination of acetic 
acid.

Ar O-CO-Me 

Conditions for effecting this conversion in one step have been described. 65 The 
method involves heating a mixture of the aldehyde, hydroxylamine hydro- 
chloride, sodium formate and formic acid; and the reaction is considered to 
proceed through the intermediate formation of an oxime formate. 

Experiment 6.169 BENZONITRILE

Place 45 g (0.37 mol) of benzamide (prepared from benzoyl chloride, cf. Expt

bottomed flask (for exact experimental details on the handling and weighing 
out of phosphoric oxide, see isobutyronitrile, Expt 5.160). Mix well. Fit the 
flask with a Claisen distillation head (Fig. 2.13(c)) and distil under reduced 
pressure using a water pump with an air leak in the system so that a pressure 
of about 100 mmHg is attained. Heat the flask with a free flame until no more 
liquid distils: the nitrile will pass over at 126-130 °C/100 mmHg. Wash the 
distillate with a little sodium carbonate solution, then with water, and dry 
over anhydrous calcium chloride or magnesium sulphate. Distil under 
normal pressure from a 50-ml flask: the benzonitrile passes over as a 
colourless liquid at 188-189 °C. The yield is 28 g (74%). The i.r. spectrum of 
benzonitrile is shown in Fig. 3.39.

lower layer generally dissolves on snaking. Again saturate the solution with 
ammonia and allow it to stand for a further 4 hours. Repeat the saturation 
with ammonia; crystals of the amide commence to appear in the solution. 
Evaporate to dryness in a dish on the steam bath and dry at 120 °C. The yield 
of nicotinamide, m.p. 130°C, is usually quantitative.

flask in a Silicone oil or fusible metal bath and arrange for distillation under a 
pressure of about 30 mraHg. Raise the temperature of the bath rapidly to 
300 °C, then remove the bath and continue the heating with a free flame as 
long as a distillate is obtained. The nitrile crystallises on cooling to a snow- 
white solid. Redistil the solid at atmospheric pressure; practically all of it 
passes over at 201 °C and crystallises completely on cooling. The yield of 3- 
cyanopyridine, m.p. 49 °C, is 18 g (86%). 

General procedure for the direct conversion of a carboxylic acid into a nitrile. 64 

In a 50-ml three- necked flask are placed the carboxylic acid (0.01 mol), ethyl 
polyphosphate (6g, PPE) and purified chloroform (5 ml). The mixture is 
cooled in an ice bath and the flask is connected to a balloon containing 
ammonia gas ( « 3 litres). Air in the flask is replaced with ammonia and the 
mixture is mechanically stirred at 0-5 °C for 30 minutes and then at room 
temperature for one and a half hours whereupon the mixture turns very 
viscous (1). The balloon is removed and PPE (10 g) is added. The stirring is 
continued at 80 °C until the reaction is complete (usually within several 
hours); the dehydration is monitored by t.l.c. analysis (1). The mixture is 
stirred with aqueous 25 per cent sodium carbonate solution (150 ml), and 
then extracted with benzene (3 x 40 ml; CAUTION). The combined organic 
extracts are dried with sodium sulphate and evaporated. The residual oil is 
passed through a short column packed with silica gel («20g) and the 
product eluted with benzene. The eluate is evaporated and the residue 
purified by short path distillation under reduced pressure (Kugelrohr 
apparatus). 

Note. (1) Formation of the amide and the nitrile may be monitored by t.l.c. analysis.

Dissolve 83 g (0.5 mol) of veratraldehyde (Expt 6.111) in 200 ml of warm 
rectified spirit in a 1 -litre round- bottomed flask, and add a warm solution of 
42 g (0.6 mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 50 ml of water. Mix 
thoroughly and run in a solution of 30 g of sodium hydroxide in 40 ml of 
water. Allow the mixture to stand for 2.5 hours, add 250 g of crushed ice and 
saturate the solution with carbon dioxide. The aldoxime separates as an oil: 
allow the mixture to stand for 12-24 hours in an ice chest or refrigerator 
when the oil will solidify. Filter off the crystalline aldoxime at the pump, wash 
well with cold water and dry in the air upon filter paper. The yield of 
veratraldoxime is 88 g (96%). 

Into a 250-ml round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux air condenser, 
place 88 g of veratraldoxime and 100 g (92.5 ml) of redistilled acetic 
anhydride. Heat cautiously. Immediately the vigorous reaction commences, 
remove the flame. When the reaction subsides, boil the solution gently for 20 
minutes and then pour it carefully with stirring into 300 ml of cold water.

CHAPTER 7 

SELECTED ALICYCLIC COMPOUNDS 



In this chapter some illustrative and interesting examples of ring-forming 
reactions leading to a selection of compounds having a range of ring sizes are 
discussed. The reactions are grouped under the following general procedures. 

1. Intramolecular nucleophilic displacement reactions. 

2. Intramolecular addition reactions of carbanions to a carbonyl group. 

3. Insertion reactions. 

4. Ring expansion and ring contraction reactions. 

5. Reduction of aromatic compounds. 

6. Cycloaddition reactions. 

Procedures 1 and 2, in which the key reaction step is the formation of a 
carbon-carbon bond by an intramolecular process, provide important syntheses 
for ring sizes from three carbon atoms upwards. For a discussion of the kinetic 
and thermodynamic factors of these ring-forming reactions, and of the Baldwin 
Rules, 1 the reader is referred to standard and specialised texts. These aspects are 
briefly referred to here in the context of particular syntheses. The insertion of a 
carbon species (procedure 3) into a carbon-carbon multiple bond uniquely pro- 
vides a route to three-membered rings. Ring contraction and ring expansion 
reactions (procedure 4) are of value for the conversion of a readily available ring 
compound into a smaller or a larger ring that could be difficult to form by the 
other general methods. The reduction of aromatic compounds (procedure 5) is 
an important route to six-membered ring compounds. The examples of cyclo- 
addition reactions (procedure 6), which illustrate the formation of four- and six- 
membered rings, involve the probable simultaneous formation of two carbon- 
carbon bonds under the influence of either thermal or photochemical con- 
ditions. 



7.1 INTRAMOLECULAR NUCLEOPHILIC DISPLACEMENT REACTIONS 

Three target molecules, namely, cyclopropyl methyl ketone (1), cyclobutane- 
carboxylic acid (2) and 3-benzylcyclobutanone (3), are used to illustrate appro- 
priate retrosynthetic disconnection strategies that may be applied to devise 
suitable synthetic procedures for these compounds.

7.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



In the case of cyclopropyl methyl ketone, disconnection of either the 1,2- or 
1,3-carbon-carbon bond of the cyclopropane ring results in the preferred charge 
distribution shown in (4), namely, the carbanion site is adjacent to the meso- 
merically stabilising carbonyl group, and the carbocation site may be viewed as 
a halide-carrying carbon. The reagent equivalent may therefore be 5-chloro- 
pentan-2-one.

A retrosynthetic analysis for this latter compound (as shown below) shows that 
it could arise from ethylene oxide [reagent equivalent to (5), see Section 5.4.2, 
p. 533], and ethyl acetoacetate [reagent equivalent to (6), see Section 5.8.5, 
p. 619].

The synthetic route (Expt 7.1) uses 2-acetylbutyrolactone, which is available 
commercially, as a convenient source of the required chloropentanone. 




The three-membered ring system, although the most highly strained of all the 
ring sizes, is readily formed in the cyclisation step. This arises from the fact that 
carbon-carbon bond formation in this case is an irreversible intramolecular S^2 
displacement of halogen reaction, which is facilitated by the thermodynamically 
favourable anfi'-periplanar conformation of the anion.

The carbocation site may be seen to arise from a carbon-carrying halogen; the 
reagent equivalent of the carbanion site is a substituted malonic ester (see 
Section 5.11.6, p. 680). The reagent equivalent of the synthon could therefore 
reasonably be 3-bromopropylmalonic ester (8). Disconnection of this latter 
compound would yield, as reagent equivalents, 1,4-dibromobutane and malonic 
ester. Overall, therefore, the synthetic route may be seen to be the reaction of the 
dianion of malonic ester with an a, a&gt;rdihalide, followed by hydrolysis and decar- 
boxylation (Expt 7.2). This general strategy of ring synthesis is an important 
method which is applicable to ring sizes from three- to seven-membered rings, 
and is only limited by the availability of the appropriate dihalogen compounds.

The synthesis of 3-benzylcyclobutanone (3) is an illustration of an overall 
intramolecular alkylation of an acyl anion equivalent (Section 5.9). The &lt;x,ca- 
dihalide is 2-benzyl-l,3-dibromopropane, and the acyl anion equivalent is 
methyl methylthiomethyl sulphoxide 2 ; the product is 1-methylsulphinyl-l- 
methylthio-3-benzylcyclobutane which is obtained as a mixture of cis/trans 
isomers [(9) and (10)] (Expt 7.3). Aqueous acid hydrolysis in ethereal solution 
unmasks the carbonyl group. The possible mechanism of the reaction is via a 
Stevens-type rearrangement of the intermediate sulphur ylide, which may pro- 
ceed in a pericylic, radical or ion pair fashion.

7.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



5-Chloropentan-2-one. Assemble a distillation unit consisting of a 500-ml 
round-bottomed flask, a still-head, a large double surface condenser and a 
250-ml receiving flask; cool the latter in an ice bath. Place into the flask 64 g 
(0.5 mol) of 2-acetylbutyrolactone, 90 ml of water and a few chips of broken 
porcelain, and then add 75 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and shake to 
mix. Heat the flask gently on a wire gauze until carbon dioxide is evolved 
briskly, and continue to heat cautiously until effervescence moderates and the 
contents of the flask become very dark (about 5-10 minutes). Then heat the 
flask strongly, preferably using two burners, so that rapid distillation ensues. 
When about 125 ml of distillate has been collected, add 75 ml of water stead- 
ily to the flask from a dropping funnel fitted to the still-head without inter- 
rupting the distillation. Collect a total of 200 ml of distillate; the entire 
distillation should be completed within about 75 minutes. Separate the pale 
yellow organic phase from the distillate, extract the aqueous phase with three 
30 ml portions of ether and dry the combined organic layers over anhydrous 
calcium chloride. Remove the ether by distillation through a lagged 10 x 
1.5 cm fractionating column packed with glass helices and distil the residue 
(1) under reduced pressure (water-pump). Collect the 5-chloropentan-2-one 
at 70-73 °C/20mmHg, the yield is 45 g (75%). 

Cyclopropyl methyl ketone. Place a solution of 20 g (0.5 mol) of sodium 
hydroxide in 20 ml of water in a 250-ml three-necked flask fitted with a drop- 
ping funnel, a reflux condenser and an efficient sealed stirrer unit. With vigor- 
ous stirring add 42 g (0.35 mol) of 5-chloropentan-2-one during 30 minutes; 
heat the flask gently during the addition so that the reaction mixture refluxes 
steadily. Continue heating under reflux for a further period of 1 hour, and 
then add slowly 45 ml of water and continue to reflux for 1 hour more, main- 
taining vigorous stirring throughout. Rearrange the condenser for distillation 
and distil out the reaction product until an organic layer no longer remains in 
the flask. Saturate the distillate with potassium carbonate, separate the 
organic phase and extract the aqueous phase with three 15 ml portions of 
ether. Dry the combined organic extracts over anhydrous calcium chloride 
and then over anhydrous calcium sulphate. Remove the ether by flash distil- 
lation through a lagged 10 x 1.5 cm fractionating column (glass helices), and 
continue distilling collecting the cyclopropyl methyl ketone as a fraction of 
b.p. 111-112°C; the yield is 24 g (82%). 

Note. (1) The crude residue may be used directly in the next stage.

apparatus be thoroughly dry. Place 212g (1.05 mol) of 1.3-dibromopropane 
(Expt 5.54) and 160g (1 mol) of diethyl malonate (dried over anhydrous cal- 
cium sulphate) in the flask. Start the stirrer and add a solution of 46 g (2 mol) 
of sodium in 800 ml of super-dry ethanol (Section 4.1.9, p. 401) (1) down the 
condenser from a dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature of the 
reaction mixture is maintained at 60-65 °C (50-60 minutes). When the addi- 
tion is complete, allow the mixture to stand until the temperature falls to 50- 
55 °C, and then heat on a water bath until a few drops of the liquid when 
added to water are no longer alkaline to phenolphthalein (about 2 hours). 
Add sufficient water to dissolve the precipitate of sodium bromide, and 
remove the ethanol by distillation from a water bath. Steam distil the residue 
until all the diethyl cyclobutane-l,l-dicarboxylate and unchanged diethyl 
malonate are removed; collect about 4 litres of distillate during 9-10 hours. 
Extract the entire steam distillate with three 350 ml portions of ether; remove 
the ether from the combined extracts on a water bath (rotary evaporator). 
Reflux the residual liquid with a solution of 112 g of potassium hydroxide in 
200 ml of ethanol for 2 hours. Distil off most of the ethanol and then evapor- 
ate the residue to dryness on a water bath (rotary evaporator). Dissolve the 
solid residue in 100 ml of hot water, and add concentrated hydrochloric acid 
(c. 80 ml) cautiously until the solution is just acid to litmus. Boil for a few 
minutes to remove carbon dioxide, render slightly alkaline with ammonia 
solution and add a slight excess of aqueous barium chloride to the boiling 
solution. Filter the hot solution to remove the barium malonate, cool the fil- 
trate and render it strongly acid with concentrated hydrochloric acid (90- 
100 ml of acid: use Congo red paper). Extract the solution with four 250 ml 
portions of ether. Dry the combined extracts with anhydrous calcium chlor- 
ide and remove the ether on a rotary evaporator. Spread the solid on a 
porous tile to remove oily impurities. The beautifully crystalline product 
(55 g, 38%) consists of pure cyclobutane-l,l-dicarboxylic acid, m.p. 158 °C. It 
may be recrystallised from hot ethyl acetate, but the m.p. is unchanged. 

Place 30 g (0.28 mol) of cyclobutane-l,l-dicarboxylic acid in a 100-ml flask 
fitted with a still-head carrying a thermometer and leading to a cooled 
receiver flask via a short air condenser. Heat the flask in a Silicone oil bath at 
160-170 °C until all effervescence ceases. Then raise the temperature of the 
bath to 210 °C; the cyclobutanecarboxylic acid passes over at 191-197 °C. 
Redistil the acid; the pure acid distils at 195-196 °C. The yield of cyclobutane- 
carboxylic acid (a colourless liquid) is 18 g (86%).

tion of 2-benzyl-l,3-dibromopropane (1.03 g, 3.53 mmol) (1) at — 10 °C, the 
mixture is stirred at — 10 °C for 100 minutes and then at room temperature 
for 3 hours. Dichloromethane (100 ml) is added and the organic layer washed 
with water (30 ml). The aqueous layer is extracted with two 50 ml portions of 
dichloromethane. The organic layers are combined, washed with brine 
(20 ml) and dried (sodium sulphate). The solvents are evaporated and the 
residue subjected to column chromatography on silica gel using dichloro- 
methane-ethyl acetate (9 : 1) as eluant to give the product as a pale yellow oil, 
686 mg, 77 per cent; i.r. 1055, 1035 cm" 1 . The product consists of two di- 
astereoisomers in the ratio 2: 1; the methyl signals of the major isomer 
appeared at &lt;5 2. 12 and 2.49, and of the minor isomer at &lt;52.08 and 2.42. 

3-Benzylcyclobutanone. The foregoing compound (2.70 g, 10.6 mmol) is dis- 
solved in ether (140 ml), and 4.5 m sulphuric acid (2.8 ml) is added. The result- 
ing mixture is stirred at room temperature for two days, and then heated 
under reflux for two days. After the addition of sodium hydrogen carbonate 
and magnesium sulphate, the mixture is stirred for a while and then the insol- 
uble solid filtered off. The filtrate is concentrated and the residue subjected to 
column chromatography on silica gel using dichloromethane and hexane as 
eluants to give 3-benzylcyclobutanone as a colourless oil, 1.13 g, 66 per cent; 
i.r. (neat) 1785 cm" 1 ; p.m.r. (CDC1 3 , TMS), 3 2.43-3.49 (m, 7H), and 7.21 
(s, 5H). 

Note. (1) 2-Benzyl-l,3-dibromopropane may be prepared from diethyl benzyl- 
malonate (Expt 5.132), by lithium aluminium hydride reduction to give 2-benzyl- 
propane-l,3-diol (for conditions compare Expt 5.38), and subsequent conversion into 
the dibromo derivative using the conditions described in Expt 5.54 as a guide. 

7.2 INTRAMOLECULAR ADDITION REACTIONS OF CARBANIONS TO 
A CARBONYL GROUP 

The intramolecular carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions considered in this 
section are based on the aldol condensation (see Section 5.18.2, p. 799), the 
Claisen-Schmidt reaction (see Section 6.12.2, p. 1032), the Claisen ester conden- 
sation (see Section 5.14.3, p. 736), and the Claisen reaction (see Section 6.12.2, 
p. 1032). Since these carbonyl addition reactions are reversible, the methods of 
synthesis are most successful for the formation of the thermodynamically stable 
five- and six-membered ring systems. The preparation of the starting materials 
for some of these cyclisation reactions further illustrates the utility of the 
Michael reaction (see Section, 5.11.6, p. 681). 

The first group of target molecules that are considered are the cyclic a,j8- 
unsaturated ketones, 3-methylcyclopent-2-enone (11), 3-methylcyclohex-2- 
enone (12), ( + )-7a(S)-7,7a,-dihydro-7a-methyl-l,5(6H)-indanedione (13), and 
tetraphenylcyclopentadienone (14).

SELECTED ALICVCLIC COMPOUNDS 7.2 



In the case of (11), retrosynthetic functional group interconversion into the 
aldol followed by disconnection of the a, j8-bond gives the dipolar synthon (15), 
of which the reagent equivalent is the 1,4-dicarbonyl compound, hexane-2,5- 
dione (i.e. a retro-aldol condensation). The action of base on this diketone effects 
the forward aldol reaction followed by spontaneous dehydration (see Expt 7.4 
for formulation). 



Me OH 





A similar retrosynthetic analysis for (12), gives the 1,5-diketone, heptane-2,6- 
dione. Disconnection on this diketone, similar to those described in Section 5.9 
for 1,2- to 1,4-diketones, would lead to a number of possible methods of syn- 
thesis. In the synthesis described in Expt 7.5, 3,5-diethoxycarbonylheptane-2,6- 
dione (ethyl methylenebisacetoacetate) (16) is formed from formaldehyde (as 
paraformaldehyde) and ethyl acetoacetate in the presence of piperidine 
(Knoevenagel/Michael reactions) (cf. the synthesis of pyridines, Expt 8.29). 
Cyclisation of (16) is effected on heating in the presence of base to give 4,6- 
diethoxycarbonyl-3-methylcyclohex-2-enone (17). Both ethoxycarbonyl groups 
are removed when the diester is heated for some time with aqueous acid, forming 
3-methylcyclohex-2-enone (12). The further reaction of this compound with a 
Grignard reagent, which proceeds by 1,4-conjugate addition to the enone 
system, gives a 3-alkyl-3-methylcyclohexanone (18).

The forward synthetic sequence would therefore involve the Michael reaction of 
2-methylcyclopentane-l,3-dione with methyl vinyl ketone to give (20), followed 
by cyclisation to the hydroxyketone (19), and then dehydration to the target 
molecule (13a). The overall process of addition and cyclisation is known as the 
Robinson annelation reaction. 3 In this preparative example (Expt 7.6) the methyl 
vinyl ketone is used directly under conditions which minimise its polymerisa- 
tion; 43 it should be noted, however, that many literature examples of the annela- 
tion reaction use Mannich bases or the corresponding methiodides as an in situ 
source of the a, ^-unsaturated carbonyl component (see Section 5.18.2, p. 801). 
When the cyclisation step (20) to (19) is carried out in the presence of (S)- 
( — )-proline as the chiral inducing reagent, the bicyclic hydroxydiketone (22) is 
obtained in 93.4 per cent optical purity. 4b It is suggested that proline adds to one 
of the carbonyl groups of the cyclopentanedione, and the formation of two 
hydrogen bonds as shown, imposes topographical rigidity on the conformation 
of the tricyclic transition state (21). The proline residue is thus trans- related to 
the angular methyl group, and carbon-carbon bond formation would then 
occur from the side opposite to the methyl group to give the ds-fused hydroxy 
diketone. Dehydration by azeotropic distillation in benzene then gives the target 
molecule (13) (Expt 7.6).

The disconnection of both carbon-carbon double bonds in tetraphenylcyclo- 
pentadienone (14) ('tetracyclone'), in the manner of the examples above, leads to 
recognition of benzil and dibenzyl ketone as the reagents for its synthesis.

This double Claisen-Schmidt reaction takes place under the influence of ethano- 
lic potassium hydroxide (Expt 7.7) and presumably proceeds in the stepwise 
manner (cf. formulation in Section 6.12.2, p. 1032). The four aryl groups in tetra- 
cyclopentadienone effectively stabilise the cyclopentadienone system, which 
otherwise has only a transient existence and readily undergoes dimerisation by 
way of a diene-dienophile interaction (Diels-Alder reaction, Section 7.6). The 
use of tetracyclone as a dienophile for the preparation of 3,4,5,6-tetraphenyl- 
dihydrophthalic anhydride is noted on p. 1121. 

The second group of cyclic compounds which illustrate the intramolecular 
carbanion addition to a carbonyl group, include 2-ethoxycarbonylcyclo- 
pentanone (23) and indane-l,3-dione (24).

The synthesis may thus be seen to be an intramolecular Claisen ester condensa- 
tion, which is known as the Dieckmann reaction. The procedure is an important 
method for the synthesis of five- and six-membered ring systems, and the cyclic 
j8-keto ester product may be converted into the corresponding cyclic ketone by 
hydrolysis followed by decarboxylation (ketonic hydrolysis, see Section 5.8.5, 
p. 619). The base catalyst used in Expt 7.8 is sodium ethoxide, but sodium 
hydride as a 50 per cent dispersion in oil is a recommended alternative. 

A similar disconnection for indane-l,3-dione (24) gives the dipolar synthon 
(26), from which it may be inferred that the reagent equivalent could be 
o-ethoxycarbonylacetophenone.

The synthesis of this starting material may prove troublesome, but if an activat- 
ing group (C0 2 Et) is formally added to the methyl group, further disconnection 
leads to the recognition of diethyl phthalate and ethyl acetate as the reagent 
equivalents of the synthons (27) and (28) respectively.

The forward synthetic reaction (formulated in Expt 7.9) is thus an initial mixed 
Claisen ester condensation, followed by a Dieckmann cyclisation, hydrolysis 
and decarboxylation. Indane-l,3-dione is used for the synthesis of the trione, 
ninhydrin (Expt 5.99). 

The radical reductive cyclisation of diesters to acyloins (see also Section 5.9.1, 
p. 628) is an important method of synthesis for ring sizes from four-membered 
upwards. The example selected here is 2-hydroxy-3-methylcyclopent-2-enone 
('corylone') (29) (Expt 7.10), which is an important perfumery and flavouring 
material. 53 In the first step (i), methyl acrylate is converted into its dimer with 
tris(cyclohexyl)phosphine in pyridine solution. 5b Step (ii) is the protection of the 
double bond by conversion into the dimethylamino adduct. The acyloin reac- 
tion is step (iii), and the product is trapped as its bis(trimethylsilyl)ether. Finally, 
in step (iv), the protecting dimethylamino and trimethylsilyl groups are removed 
by passage down a column of silica gel.

The third group of cyclic compounds formed by intramolecular carbanion

Disconnection of either of the carbonyl-carbon bonds to the common methy- 
lene group in dimedone gives the &lt;5-keto ester (32) as the reagent equivalent. A 
further disconnection of this ester reveals the synthons (33) and (34), the reagent 
equivalents of which are 4-methylpent-3-en-2-one (mesityl oxide) and malonic 
ester. The overall synthesis (see Expt 7. 1 1 for formulation) is thus a Michael 
reaction between these latter reagents followed by a Claisen condensation in the 
cyclisation step, and then hydrolysis and decarboxylation to remove the activat- 
ing ethoxycarbonyl group originally sited in the malonic ester molecule.

overall loss of a molecule of oxalic acid, to yield finally the trione product (Expt

Cyclobutanone is an important synthetic starting material (e.g. see Expt 
5.41); recently a simple synthesis from readily available materials has been re- 
ported. 6 The synthesis (Expt 7.13) involves the formation of l,3-bis[bromo- 
magnesio]propane and its further reaction with carbon dioxide to form the 
complex (36), which precipitates from solution thus simplifying the purification 
procedure. Although the overall yield is low (13%), this is compensated for by 
the cheapness of the reagents and the simplicity of the procedure.

4,6-Diethoxycarbonyl-3-methylcyclohex-2-enone. Place 130g (l.Omol) of 
ethyl acetoacetate, 15.0g (0.5 mol) of powdered paraformaldehyde and 5g 
(5.8 ml) of piperidine in a 500-ml round-bottomed flask. Allow the reaction to 
proceed at room temperature; after a short period (about 5 minutes) the con- 
tents of the flask rapidly heat up and the solid paraformaldehyde begins to 
dissolve. Moderate the reaction as required by cooling in iced water. When 
the vigorous reaction is over and the reaction mixture is homogeneous (about 
20 minutes) heat the mixture on a water bath for 1 hour. The flask now con- 
tains the crude product together with a little water formed in the reaction. 
The crude product may be used directly for conversion into 3-methylcyclo- 
hex-2-enone by acid hydrolysis as described below. If required, it may be pur- 
ified and dried in the following way. Dissolve the crude material in 200 ml of 
dichloromethane in a separatory funnel and wash successively with two 
100 ml portions of 2.5 m hydrochloric acid, then two 100 ml portions of satur- 
ated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and two 200 ml portions of water. 
Dry the organic phase over anhydrous calcium sulphate and remove the sol- 
vent on a rotary evaporator. The yield of crude 4,6-diethoxycarbonyl-3-

by vacuum distillation since extensive decomposition takes place. It is, how- 
ever, pure enough for most purposes.

fully and with cooling to the cooled reaction solution. Extract with three 
150 ml portions of ether, dry the ethereal extract over anhydrous sodium sul- 
phate and remove the ether on a rotary evaporator. Distil the residue under 
reduced pressure through a short fractionating column and collect the 3- 
methylcyclohex-2-enone as a fraction, b.p. 95 °C/25 mmHg. The yield is 24 g

bottomed flask equipped with a sealed stirrer unit, a pressure-equalising 
funnel and a reflux condenser. When all the magnesium has dissolved, clamp 
the flask in a cooling bath of Cardice-acetone and replace the condenser with 
a low-temperature-reading thermometer. When the temperature has fallen to

62.5 g (1.11 mol) of potassium hydroxide in 300 ml of water, and reflux again 
on a water bath with stirring for 6 hours. Acidify the reaction mixture (to 
litmus) while still hot with dilute hydrochloric acid (1:2 by volume): about 
275 ml are required. Fit the flask with a condenser for distillation, and distil 
off as much alcohol as possible by heating with stirring on a water bath. 
Allow the residue in the flask to cool somewhat, add 8 g of decolourising 
carbon slowly, boil for 10 minutes and filter; repeat the treatment with de- 
colourising carbon. Neutralise the residue to litmus by the addition of dilute 
hydrochloric acid (about 75 ml) and boil again with 8 g of decolourising char- 
coal. Filter and render the hot yellow filtrate distinctly acid to methyl orange 
with dilute hydrochloric acid (25-50 ml), boil for a few minutes and allow to 
cool whereupon the dimedone crystallises out. Filter at the pump, wash with 
ice-cold water and dry in the air. The yield of dimedone, m.p. 147-148 °C, is 
60 g (84%). Recrystallisation from acetone (about 8 ml per gram) raises the 
m.p. to 148-149 °C, but this is generally unnecessary.

A 4-litre, three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet, 
a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer and a pressure-equalising dropping 
funnel, is dried by heating with a flame under evacuation. Under nitrogen, it 
is charged with magnesium (264 g, 11 mol) and anhydrous ether (1.5 litres). 
Under rapid stirring, a solution of 1,3-dibromopropane (212 g, 1.05 mol) in 
ether (1.5 litres) is added during 15 hours. Afterwards, the reaction mixture is 
transferred by nitrogen pressure through a glass tube plugged with glass wool 
into another dry 4-litre, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a 
gas inlet, a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrier. At room temperature, 
a gaseous mixture (2 : 1) of nitrogen and carbon dioxide (30.2 litres, carbon 
dioxide from dry ice, dried by leading the gas through a tube filled with a mix- 
ture of calcium chloride and phosphorus pentoxide) is introduced above the 
surface of the rapidly stirred solution during 3 hours. Then the supernatant 
solution is decanted; to the white, solid residue, water (150 ml) is added drop- 
wise, followed by 4 m hydrochloric acid (250 ml). The mixture is extracted 
with pentane (400 ml) by continuous extraction (14 hours); g.l.c. analysis 
(Carbowax 20M, isothermal, 90 °C) of the pentane solution and comparison 
with authentic samples reveals the presence of cyclobutanone (41%) and cyc- 
lobutanol (2%); p.rar. spectroscopy shows that glutaric acid (17%) is also 
present. The pentane solution is subjected to distillation on a spinning band 
column (0.65 m) at normal pressure; after removal of the pentane, cyclobuta- 
none is obtained by vacuum distillation. The yield is 9.7 g (13%, based on 
dibromopropane), b.p. 44°C/140mbar, purity &gt;98 per cent by g.l.c; p.m.r.

7.3 INSERTION REACTIONS 

A most convenient method for the formation of cyclopropane ring systems is the 
insertion of a carbon residue into a carbon-carbon double bond. The reagents

may be carbenes or carbenoids generated from diazomethane and related diazo 
compounds (cf. also Sections 5.11.4, p. 675 and 6.1.5, p. 848), diiodo- or 
dibromo-methane and zinc-copper couple, or chloroform and alkali (cf. also 
Section 6.10.1, p. 991), or the sulphur ylide generated from trimethyl- 
sulphoxonium iodide and sodium hydride (cf. also Section 8.1.2, p. 1131). 

The illustrative examples of these reactions are the synthesis of ( — )-2,7,7- 
trimethyltricyclo[4.1.1.0 2 ' 4 ] octane (37), 7,7-dichlorobicyclo[4.1.0]heptane (38), 
and ethyl (rans-2-methylcyclopropane-l-carboxylate (39).

Diiodomethane with zinc-copper couple is a particularly good reagent for 
the insertion of a methylene group into an olefinic bond. The reaction is known 
as the Simmons-Smith procedure, 10 and is likely to proceed as follows: 




Znl 2 

(40) 

Since the free carbene (:CH 2 ) is not thought to be present, the reagent (40) is 
termed a carbenoid. The activity of the zinc surface is of crucial importance to 
the smoothness and success of the reaction. Failure to ensure appropriate acti- 
vation procedures may cause the reaction to fail, or the onset of the exothermic 
reaction may be delayed and then proceed with excessive vigour. The recent use 
of ultrasonic activation of the zinc surface from the outset of the reaction results 
in a smoother, less unpredictable reaction rate, and leads to satisfactory 
yields. 113 Furthermore, sonication enables the cheaper dibromomethane to be 
employed. 1 lb 

The reaction is illustrated by the cyclopropanation of a-pinene (Expt 7.14); a 
general procedure which is applicable to a wide range of olefins is also noted. 

Dichlorocarbene is the reactive intermediate formed by the reaction of alkali 
on chloroform, and typically it adds to olefins to give 1,1-dichlorocyclo- 
propanes. The PTC procedure for the generation of dichlorocarbene is particu- 
larly useful and is illustrated by its reaction with cyclohexene to form (38) (Expt 
7.15). The mechanism is formulated below and probably involves the reaction of 
the quaternary ammonium hydroxide with chloroform at the phase boundary, 
and dissolution into the organic phase of the quaternary ammonium derivative 
of the trichloromethyl anion (41). This species breaks down to form dichloro- 
carbene and the quaternary ammonium chloride. The latter returns to the 
aqueous phase to maintain the cycle of events, while the dichlorocarbene reacts 
rapidly with the cyclohexene in the organic phase.

The use of dimethylsulphoxonium methylide, as a specific methylene inser- 
tion reagent for a, ^-unsaturated ketones and esters, is illustrated by its reaction 
with ethyl crotonate in dimethylformamide solution to form (39) (Expt 7.16). 12 
The sulphur ylide initially attacks the /?-carbon of the conjugated system 
(Michael acceptor site), and this is followed by cyclisation and loss of dimethyl 
sulphoxide.

Cognate preparation. General procedure for cyclopropanations using dibromo- 
methane. llb A 500-ml, three- necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a 
Graham (coil) condenser and drying tube over an Allihn condenser, a 
pressure-equalising dropping funnel, and equipped with mechanical stirring. 
Into the flask are added zinc dust (52 g, 0.80 mol), copper(i) chloride (8g, 
0.08 mol), anhydrous ether (75 ml) and dibromomethane (70 g, 0.40 mol). To 
the addition funnel is added the alkene (0.20 mol) in anhydrous ether (50 ml). 
The apparatus is positioned in a 125 W Branson ultrasonic bath which is 
filled to about 3 cm from the top with water preheated to 45-50 °C. Sonica- 
tion and stirring are started, and the position of the bath beneath the reaction 
vessel is varied so as to achieve maximum cavitation. Then the alkene is 
added dropwise to the reaction mixture over a 5-10 minute period. After 
approximately a 1 hour induction period, the reaction of the dibromo- 
methane and zinc-copper couple usually starts. This is evidenced by the 
change in the colour of the reaction mixture from grey to a purple grey and by 
the onset of rapid refluxing. The stirring and sonication are continued for an 
additional 3 hours. 

As an alternative procedure, which results in a shorter induction period 
but otherwise has no major effect on the reaction, addition of the alkene is 
postponed until after the reaction of the zinc-copper couple and dibromo- 
methane starts (c. 30 minutes). Sonication is continued for an additional 60 
minutes and stirring without sonication for a further 60 minutes. 

After the reaction is complete, the ultrasonic bath is removed, and the 
reaction mixture cooled in an ice bath, diluted with pentane (200 ml), and, 
while being stirred, treated by dropwise addition of saturated ammonium 
chloride solution (150 ml). The organic layer is separated and the aqueous 
layer washed with pentane (1 x 50 ml). The combined organic layer is 
washed with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution (1 x 100 ml) and dried 
over magnesium sulphate. The solvents are removed by distillation on a 
steam bath through a Vigreux column, and the remaining oil fractionally dis- 
tilled. 

This procedure has been used for the cyclopropanation of cyclohexene, 
cyclooctene, a-pinene, j8-pinene, hex-1-ene, oct-1-ene, (£)-but-2-en-l-ol, and 
2,3-dihydropyran.

7.4 RING EXPANSION AND RING CONTRACTION REACTIONS 



Cyclohexanone and pulegone provide useful examples to illustrate ring expan- 
sion and ring contraction procedures. 

Ring expansion of cyclohexanone to cycloeheptanone may be effected by 
reaction with diazomethane (Expt 7.17). The ring-expanded ketone is obtained 
in about 60 per cent yield and is accompanied by some epoxide and some cyclo- 
octanone which results from further ring expansion of the cycloheptanone. 
Mechanistically the reaction may be represented in the following manner.

The cycloheptanone is readily separated by taking advantage of the fact that it 
alone forms a solid bisulphite compound. 

The Favorskii rearrangement results from the action of base on an a-halo 
ketone. When applied to cyclic ketones, ring contraction results, as shown in the 
classic case of cyclohexanone formulated below.

It should be noted that in this case either of the carbonyl-carbon bonds in the 
symmetrical intermediate cyclopropanone system could be cleaved. With 
unsymmetrically substituted cyclic ketones (or indeed open chain ketones), the 
direction of cleavage is that which would lead to the more stable carbanion. 

The example given in Expt 7.18 is the formation of a mixture of cis and trans 
ethyl pulegenates (ethyl 5-methyl-2-isopropylidenecyclopentanecarboxylate) 
from pulegone by reaction with bromine to give the dibromide, followed by 
treatment with sodium ethoxide. 14

In this case the cleavage of the cyclopropanone system is directed by the con- 
certed loss of the second bromine. The cis/trans ratio appears to be determined 
by a subsequent epimerisation in which the thermodynamically more stable 
trans isomer predominates. Hydrolysis of the mixed isomers with aqueous alkali 
leads to the exclusive formation of frans-pulgenic acid, resulting from the rapid 
base catalysed equilibration of the cis/trans esters and the retarded rate of 
hydrolysis of the sterically hindered cis ester.

CAUTION: This preparation must be carried out in an efficient fume cupboard 
(see Section 4.2.25, p. 430). 

In a 1 -litre three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical 
stirrer and a dropping funnel, place 49 g (0.5 mol) of redistilled cyclohexa- 
none, 125 g (0.585 mol) of JV-methyl-JV-nitrosotoluene-p-sulphonamide, 
150 ml of 95 per cent ethanol and 10 ml of water. The nitrosamide is largely 
undissolved. Adjust the height of the stirrer so that only the upper part of the 
solution is stirred and the precipitate moves slightly; place the thermometer 
so that the bulb is in the liquid. Cool the mixture to about °C in an ice-salt 
bath. While stirring gently, add a solution of 15 g of potassium hydroxide in 
50 ml of 50 per cent aqueous ethanol dropwise very slowly from the dropping 
funnel: after 0.5-1 ml of the solution has been added, a vigorous evolution of

so that the temperature is maintained at 10-20 °C; the duration of the addi- 
tion of alkali is about 2 hours and the nitroso compound ultimately dis- 
appears. Stir the orange-yellow solution for a further 30 minutes, and then 
add 2 m hydrochloric acid until the solution is acidic to litmus paper 
(c.50ml). 

Introduce a solution of 100 g of sodium metabisulphite in 200 ml of water 
and continue the stirring, preferably for 10 hours with exclusion of air. A 
thick precipitate separates after a few minutes. Collect the bisulphite com- 
pound by suction filtration, wash it with ether until colourless and then 
decompose it in a flask with a lukewarm solution of 125 g of sodium carbon- 
ate in 150 ml of water. Separate the ketone layer, extract the aqueous layer 
with four 30 ml portions of ether, dry the combined organic layers over mag- 
nesium sulphate, remove the ether at atmospheric pressure and distil the 
residual oil under reduced pressure through a short fractionating side-arm. 
Collect the cycloheptanone at 64-65 °C/ 12 mmHg; the yield is 17 g (31%). 

Note. (1) If the reaction does not start at this stage remove the flask from the cooling 
bath and allow the mixture to warm to 10 °C; do not add any further alkali until the

water the solution is extracted with ether to remove neutral products. The 
alkaline solution is acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid and the mixture 
extracted with ether. frans-Pulegenic acid may be isolated from this extract 
by drying, evaporation and distillation; the product may be isolated as a 
colourless liquid, b.p. 124-128 °C/3mmHg, or b.p. 95-97 °C/0.45 mmHg. A 
portion of the ethereal extract is treated with an ethereal solution of diazo- 
methane (Section 4.2.25, p. 430) and converted into the corresponding methyl 
ester; g.l.c. analysis indicates the exclusive presence of methyl trans- 
pulegenate. 

7.5 REDUCTION OF AROMATIC COMPOUNDS 

A convenient route to the preparation of substituted cylohexanes is the reduc- 
tion of appropriately substituted benzenes. Total reduction is effected by hetero- 
geneous catalytic hydrogenation at temperatures in the region of 100-200 °C 
and usually under pressure. Under these conditions functional side-chain 
substituents may be variously affected (as a result of reduction or hydrogen- 
olysis), and specialised texts should be consulted for coverage of this vast field. 1 5 
Reduction of substituted benzenes with sodium (or lithium) in liquid ammo- 
nia in the presence of a proton source (such as methanol, ethanol, etc.) leads to a 
substituted, non-conjugated cyclohexadiene as a result of 1,4-addition of hydro- 
gen (the Birch reduction). 16 With benzene the product is cyclohexa-l,4-diene as a 
result of the following mechanistic pathway. 



H H H H 




With substituted benzenes the regioselectivity and the rate of the reduction 
are crucially dependent on the electron-donating or electron-withdrawing char- 
acteristics of the substituent. Thus with anisole, the rate of reaction is decreased 
and the product is l-methoxycyclohexa-l,4-diene (2,5-dihydroanisole) (42); with 
benzoic acid the rate of reaction is increased and the product is cyclohexa-2,5- 
dienecarboxylic acid (1,4-dihydrobenzoic acid) (43).

SELECTED ALICVCLIC COMPOUNDS 7.5 



The reaction rate differences are readily rationalised from a consideration of 
fundamental reaction mechanism principles (e.g. electron-donating groups in- 
crease electron density in the aromatic ring and thus hinder acceptance of an 
electron); the regioselectivity of the reduction is explained from a consideration 
of the relative stabilities of the possible alternative mesomeric intermediates, 
these being (44) in the case of anisole and (45) in the case of benzoic acid.

The Birch reduction of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid ' 7a ' b (cognate preparation 
in Expt 7.19) is of interest in that the product is l,4-dihydro-3,5-dimethoxy- 
benzoic acid (46) thus revealing that in this reduction the 4-methoxy group is 
removed by hydrogenolysis. The product possesses two methyl vinyl ether resi- 
dues which are labile under aqueous acidic conditions to yield the saturated 
diketone, 3,5-diketocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (47).

There is no standard, universal, procedure for the Birch reduction. Experi- 
ment 7.19 illustrates some of the variants which have been reported in the litera- 
ture. The original Birch procedure is to add small pieces of sodium metal to a 
solution of the aromatic compound in a mixture of liquid ammonia and the pro- 
ton source (ethanol). ' 8 After completion of the reaction, which is usually indi- 
cated by the disappearance of the blue colour, it is quenched by the addition of 
ammonium chloride and the ammonia allowed to evaporate before the cautious 
addition of water, and isolation of the product by ether extraction. In a modified 
procedure a co-solvent (ether, tetrahydrofuran, etc.) is initially added to the 
solution of aromatic compound/liquid ammonia prior to the addition of metal; 
lithium metal is often used in place of sodium. 19a,b In general these latter pro- 
cedures are used for substrates which are more difficult to reduce. Redistilled 
liquid ammonia is found to be beneficial since the common contaminant iron, in 
collodial form or in the form of its salts, has a deleterious effect on the reaction. 20 
A representative selection of procedures is given in Expt 7.19 for the reduction of 
o-xylene, anisole, benzoic acid, and 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic acid.

CAUTION: This experiment must be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard 
and the precautions and techniques for handling liquid ammonia described in 
Section 2.17.7, p. 116, must be noted. 

To liquid ammonia (400 ml) (1) held at — 70 °C is added with brisk stirring 
o- xylene (53 g, 0.5 mol) followed by small pieces of sodium metal (23 g, lg- 
atom) (2). Stirring is continued until all the sodium has dissolved and a blue 
coloured solution is obtained. Dry methanol (32 ml, 1 mol) is cautiously 
added dropwise at — 70 °C, when a vigorous reaction ensues. When the solu- 
tion is colourless the ammonia is allowed to evaporate, and water cautiously 
added. The organic layer is separated (3), dried and distilled to give 1,2- 
dimethylcyclohexa-l,4-diene (49 g, 92.5%), b.p. 141.5-143 °C (4). 

Note. (1) In general the apparatus used in these metal-liquid ammonia reductions is 
essentially that shown in Fig. 2.69 (d), but without the dropping funnel tube extension. 
The dropping funnel is replaced with the soda-lime guard-tube, which may then be 
removed at appropriate intervals for the periodic addition of metal fragments. After 
the flask has been charged with liquid ammonia, the inlet tube is replaced with a suit- 
able thermometer, the bulb of which should be immersed in the reaction solution. A 
dry ice-acetone cooling bath should be used. 

(2) Details of a large-scale preparation of l,2-cyclohexa-l,4-diene have been pub-

ate the isolation of the reduction product.

Cognate preparations. Cyclohexa-2,5-dienecarboxylic acid (1 ,4-dihydroben-

liquid ammonia (600 ml) is stirred and sodium (6.2 g, 0.27 g-atom) added in 
small pieces, followed by ammonium chloride (14.6 g, 0.27 mol). The ammo- 
nia is evaporated and the residual material dissolved in ice-water (500 ml). 
After acidification with 10 per cent hydrochloric acid the solution is extracted 
with four 100 ml portions of ether, the ether washed once with saturated 
sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated 
in vacuo. The remaining pale yellow oil is distilled at 96-98 °C (0.01 mmHg) 
to give 9.0 g (89%) of 1,4-dihydro benzoic acid; this product shows no u.v. 
absorption above 220 nm. 

l,4-Dihydro-3,5-dimethoxybenzoic acid. 11 * To solution of 3,4,5-trimethoxy- 
benzoic acid (31.8 g, 0.15 mol) in ethanol (225 ml) and liquid ammonia (1.5 
litres) is added sodium (18.0 g, 0.78 mol) in small pieces, followed by ammo- 
nium chloride (75 g, 1.45 mol). The ammonia is evaporated and the residue 
taken up in 2 litres of ice-water. Alternate additions of small portions of 10 
per cent hydrochloric acid and immediate extractions with dichloromethane 
are carried out until the solution becomes acidic to Congo red. The combined 
extracts are washed several times with water, dried over magnesium sulphate, 
filtered and concentrated in vacuo at room temperature. Trituration of the 
residue with a small amount of ether and filtration gives 1 7.7 g of product. 
Concentration of the ether filtrate yields an additional 6.3 g of white crystal- 
line product. The crude material, m.p. 100-105 °C (87%), could be recrystal- 
lised from ether-hexane. A sample prepared for elemental analysis shows 
m.p. 105 °C (decomp) or 118 °C (decomp) depending on the rate of heating.

small amount of ether and filtered, giving the diketone (66 g, 97%) as a white 
crystalline compound, m.p. 182 °C. 

General procedure for reduction with lithium. 1 9b The apparatus used for all 
these reductions in liquid ammonia is a three-necked flask equipped with a 
stirrer, dropping funnel and soda-lime guard-tube. The flask is placed in a 
box stuffed with insulating wool or cotton. At the front of the box is a sealed 
double window with a cork spacer ring and rubber gasket against which the 
flask is placed. This arrangement prevents condensation of moisture on the 
flask or window, and with illumination from the top permits observation of 
the reaction mixture at all times. The flask is filled from one-third to no more 
than one-half of its capacity, to aid in control of foaming which occurs in 
some instances towards the end of alcohol addition. 

To a solution of the compound to be reduced in dry ether or 1,2- 
dimethoxyethane is added liquid ammonia with stirring, and to the homo- 
geneous solution is added lithium wire in small pieces over a period of 1 to 10 
minutes, depending on the quantity of metal. After stirring for 10 minutes, 
absolute ethanol is added dropwise over a period of about 20 minutes. In 
some cases there is a tendency for foaming to occur near the end of this addi- 
tion. This is easily controlled by stopping the stirrer momentarily. When the 
blue colour has disappeared the ammonia is evaporated, ether and water are 
added, separated and the aqueous layer re-extracted. After washing the com- 
bined extract with saturated salt solution and drying over potassium carbon- 
ate, the ether is removed and the product isolated by crystallisation or 
distillation as appropriate. 

l-Methoxycyclohexa-l,4-diene (2,5-dihydroanisole). A solution of anisole 
(15 g) in ether (50 ml) and liquid ammonia is treated by the general procedure 
outlined above with lithium (4.5 g, 4.6 equivalents per mol) and finally with 
absolute ethanol (35 g) (30 minute addition). After ether extractions, the con- 
centrated aqueous layer (75 ml) is acidified and treated with bromine, giving 
tribromophenol (0.90 g), m.p. 93-94.5 °C, which indicates only 2 per cent 
demethylation. From the ether extracts is obtained the product (12.8 g, 84%), 
b.p. 148-149 °C, n 2 , 5 1.4782. The u.v. absorption spectrum (95% ethanol), 
X 268-269 nm (e 800) indicates the presence of about 20 per cent of 2,3-di- 
hydroanisole in the 2,5-dihydroanisole [2,3-dihydroanisole is reported 23 as 
having l max 268 nm (e4270); see also Fieser-Woodward rules for conjugated 
diene absorption, p. 390]. 



7.6 CYCLOADDITION REACTIONS 

Cycloaddition reactions represent a very versatile route to alicyclic compounds. 
The most important for six-membered rings is the Diels-Alder reaction, and its 
great utility lies in the fact that it is both regioselective and stereospecific. The 
reaction involves compounds containing a double or triple bond, usually activ- 
ated by conjugation with additional multiply-bonded systems (carbonyl, cyano, 

1117 



7.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



nitro, phenyl, etc.), which add to the 1,4-positions of a conjugated diene system 
(e.g. buta-l,3-diene) with the formation of a six-membered ring. The ethylenic or 
acetylenic compound is known as the dienophile and the second reactant as the 
diene; the product is the adduct. The product in the case of an ethylenic dieno- 
phile is a substituted cyclohexene, and in that of an ethynyl dienophile it is a sub- 
stituted cyclohexa-l,4-diene. The active unsaturated portion of the dienophile, 
or that of the diene, or those in both, may be involved in rings; the adduct is then 
polycyclic. 






Y 
(e.g. Y=COR. C£N, N0 2 . etc.) 

This formulation emphasises that the Diels-Alder reaction may be represented 
in the retrosynthetic sense as a two-group disconnection (p. 22).

Thus the two key features to be identified in the target molecule are a cyclo- 
hexene ring and an appropriately placed electron-withdrawing substituent. It 
should be noted that both structural features may be constituent parts of a 
larger, more complex molecule. 

The Diels-Alder reaction is a concerted reaction in which four Ti-electrons 
from the diene and two Ti-electrons from the dienophile participate in the transi- 
tion state. The Woodward-Hoffmann Rules provide a theoretical framework for 
these reactions. 24 They suggest that those reactions are thermally allowed which 
have 4n + 2 pericyclic electrons, i.e. 6, 10, 14, etc. The Diels-Alder reaction is an 
example where n = 1, i.e. (4 + 2) Ti-electrons. 

The Woodward-Hoffmann rules also allow the prediction of the stereo- 
chemistry of pericyclic reactions. The Diels-Alder reaction is an example of 
(te4 s + te2 s ) cycloaddition. The subscript s, meaning suprafacial, indicates that 
both elements of the addition take place on the same side of the Tr-system. Addi- 
tion to opposite sides is termed antarafacial. The Woodward-Hoffmann rules 
apply only to concerted reactions and are derived from the symmetry properties 
of the orbitals involved in the transition state. These rules may be summarised as 
shown in Table 7.1.

SELECTED ALICVCLIC COMPOUNDS 7.6 



For a more detailed treatment of the theory of pericyclic reactions the reader 
is referred to modern texts on reaction mechanism. 25 

The preparative procedure for the Diels-Alder reaction is extremely simple 
and the cycloaddition usually merely requires warming the reactants together 
either alone, or in the presence of a suitable solvent. 

The reaction has been shown to involve a stereospecific syn-addition with 
respect to the dienophile. For example, the reaction of 2,3-dimethylbuta-l,3- 
diene with maleic anhydride gives cis-l,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4,5-dimethylphthalic 
anhydride (Expt 7.20). An example of the use of a quinone as the dienophile is 
provided by the synthesis of cis- l,4,4a,9a-tetrahydro-2,3-dimethyl-9,10-anthra- 
quinone which upon dehydrogenation (most simply by the action of oxygen 
upon its solution in alcoholic potassium hydroxide) yields 2,3-dimethylanthra- 
quinone (Expt 7.21). Tetraphenylcyclopentadienone (tetracyclone) readily 
undergoes the addition of dienophiles, such as maleic anhydride, to give an 
adduct, which then extrudes a molecule of carbon monoxide on heating, as in 
the preparation of 3,4,5,6-tetraphenyldihydrophthalic anhydride (Expt 7.22). 

With less reactive dienophiles more extensive heating may be required in 
which case the reaction is best carried out in a suitable pressure vessel (e.g. the 
preparation of 4-nitro-5-phenylcyclohexene, Expt 7.23). 

Four-membered rings can be synthesised by [2 + 2] cycloadditions. How- 
ever, thermal [2 + 2] cycloadditions occur only with difficulty; they are not con- 
certed but involve diradicals. Photochemical [2 + 2] reactions are common and 
although some of these may occur by a stepwise mechanism many are concerted. 
An example of a [2 + 2] reaction is the photodimerisation of cyclopent-2-enone. 
This compound, as the neat liquid, or in a variety of solvents, on irradiation with 
light of wavelength greater than 300 nm (the n -» n* excited state is involved) is 
converted to a mixture of the 'head-to-head' (48) and 'head-to-tail' (49) dimers, 
both having the cis,anti,cis stereochemistry as shown. It is believed that the reac- 
tion proceeds by attack of an n -» n* triplet excited species on a ground state 
molecule of the unsaturated ketone (Section 2.17.5, p. 106). In the reaction de- 
scribed (Expt 7.24) the cyclopent-2-enone is irradiated in methanol and the 
'head-to-tail' dimer further reacts with the solvent to form the di-acetal which 
conveniently crystallises from the reaction medium as the irradiation proceeds; 
the other dimer (the minor product under these conditions) remains in solution. 
The di-acetal is converted to the diketone by treatment with the two-phase 
dilute hydrochloric acid-dichloromethane system. 




The cyclopent-2-enone required for the photodimerisation is prepared by the 
hydrolysis and oxidation of 3-chlorocyclopentene, which is obtained by the low 
temperature addition of hydrogen chloride to cyclopentadiene. The latter is 
obtained by heating dicyclopentadiene. This depolymerisation is an example of 
a reverse (or retro) Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction; the diene readily reforms 
the dicyclopentadiene on standing at room temperature. 

1119 



7.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The (2 + 2) cycloaddition reactions of ketenes with alkenes are synthetically 
useful routes to cyclobutanones. Ketenes are particularly useful due to the low 
steric hindrance at the carbonyl carbon. An example is the reaction of dichloro- 
ketene with cyclopentadiene which, after reductive dechlorination of the prod- 
uct, gives bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one (Expt 7.25). 

A further example of a photodimerisation reaction is provided by the forma- 
tion, in poor yield, of '1,4-naphthoquinone photodimer' (50) on irradiation of 
1,4-naphthoquinone in benzene solution (Expt 7.26). The dimerisation may be 
effected by sunlight or by means of a mercury arc lamp.

This reaction is carried out using the steel pressure vessel and techniques de- 
scribed in Section 2.17.2, p. 97. To the dry pressure vessel add 7.46 g 
(0.05 mol) of oj-nitrostyrene (Expt 6.136), about 0.1 g of hydroquinone (a 
polymerisation inhibitor) and 1 5 ml of dry toluene. Fit a rubber bung carry- 
ing a calcium chloride guard-tube and cool the vessel to — 78 °C in an 
acetone-Cardice bath. During the cooling process set up the acetone-Cardice

condenser assembly (see p. 98) and charge the receiving flask with about 100 g 
of fresh potassium hydroxide pellets. Condense into the flask about 45 ml 
(27 g, 0.5 ml) of buta-l-3-diene from a cylinder, swirl well with the potassium 
hydroxide pellets and transfer the dried diene directly to the pressure vessel 
following the procedure described in Section 2.17.2, p. 98. Assemble the 
vessel, evacuate with an oil pump until a constant pressure is obtained (a few 
minutes only) and close the exit valve. Allow the apparatus to reach room 
temperature, wrap with heating tape and heat to 120-125 °C behind a safety 
screen for 48 hours. After allowing the vessel to cool to room temperature, 
cool further to about — 15 °C and open the valve to the atmosphere. Remove 
the vessel cap and wash the contents of the vessel into a 1-litre round- 
bottomed flask with the aid of a little acetone. Remove the solvent on a rotary 
evaporator and crystallise the semi-solid residue from industrial spirit. The 
total yield (three crops) of crystallised material, m.p. 102-104 °C, is about 9 g 
(88%) and a pure colourless sample, m.p. 103 °C, may be obtained by further 
recrystallisation from industrial spirit.

Cyclopentadiene. Place 200 ml of liquid paraffin in a 500-ml, three-necked 
round-bottomed flask fitted with a large (30-cm) Vigreux column, a dropping 
funnel and a thermometer dipping into the paraffin. Attach a distillation head 
carrying a thermometer and a double surface condenser arranged for distilla- 
tion. Heat the liquid paraffin to 200-240 °C (electric heating mantle) and add 
dicyclopentadiene portionwise, from the dropping funnel, and collect the 
cyclopentadiene, b.p. 40-42 °C, which distils over in a cooled receiver, pro- 
tected from moisture. The dicyclopentadiene must be added slowly to ensure 
complete breakdown of the dimer; the temperature at the top of the still-head 
rises above 42 °C when addition is too rapid. Continue adding dicyclo- 
pentadiene (c. 300 ml) until 230 g of cyclopentadiene is obtained. The diene 
dimerises readily at room temperature, hence it should be used immediately 
or stored in the ice compartment of a refrigerator overnight.

3-Chlorocyclopentene. Place 230 g (c. 285 ml) of cyclopentadiene in a 500-ml 
measuring cylinder which is fitted with a rubber bung through which passes 
two glass tubes. One of the tubes (for introducing hydrogen chloride) should 
reach to near the bottom of the cylinder, but the other (outlet) tube should 
terminate just below the bung with its other end attached to a calcium chlor- 
ide guard-tube. Cool the cylinder and contents in a Cardice-acetone bath 
maintained at — 1 5 to — 20 °C (note the volume of the liquid), and pass in a 
rapid stream of hydrogen chloride gas until the volume of the reaction mix- 
ture increases by 42 ml. This takes about 4 hours when a Kipp's apparatus is 
used to generate the hydrogen chloride gas. Transfer the reaction mixture to a 
distillation flask and distil under reduced pressure, collecting in a receiver 
cooled in Cardice-acetone the 3-chlorocyclopentene as a colourless liquid of 
b.p. 30 °C/20 mraHg. The yield is 222 g (62%). The compound is unstable at 
room temperature, polymerising slowly to a black tar. It should be used im- 
mediately for the next stage although it may be kept overnight in a Dewar 
flask packed with Cardice. 

Cyclopent-2-enone. Place a solution of 180 g (0.6 mol) of sodium dichr ornate 
dihydrate in 630 ml of water in a 3-litre, three-necked round-bottomed flask 
equipped with an efficient stirrer, a dropping funnel and a thermometer. Cool 
the solution to °C in an ice-salt bath and slowly add, in portions over about 
1 hour, 157g (1.53 mol) of 3-chlorocyclopentene to the rapidly stirred solu- 
tion while keeping the temperature at 0-10 °C. Stir the reaction mixture at 
°C for 0.5 hour then add 300 ml of 50 per cent sulphuric acid dropwise while 
maintaining the temperature at 0-10 °C by cooling. Saturate the dark brown 
mixture with sodium chloride and extract with five 250 ml portions of ether. 
Wash the combined extracts with two 1 50 ml portions of saturated sodium 
chloride, dry over magnesium sulphate and remove the ether by flash distilla- 
tion. Distil the residual yellow oil under nitrogen under reduced pressure and 
collect the cyclopent-2-enone as a colourless liquid of b.p. 42-44 °C/ 
13mmHg. The yield is 58.8 g (47%). The compound has a retention time of 
4.1 minutes on a 1.5-m column of Carbowax 20M on Chromosorb W main- 
tained at 80 °C and with a nitrogen flow rate of 40 ml/minute.

methanol (distilled from solid potassium hydroxide) in a photochemical reac- 
tor vessel of 1-litre capacity equipped with a 100-W medium pressure 
mercury arc lamp surrounded by a Pyrex cooling jacket (Section 2.17.5, 
p. Ill), flush the magnetically stirred solution with nitrogen for 10 minutes 
and then irradiate under nitrogen overnight. Filter the white crystalline solid 
which separates and continue irradiating until no further crystalline material 
separates from the methanol solution. About 21.5 g of material is obtained 
after approximately 40 hours' irradiation. Crystallisation from methanol 
gives cj's,(rans,cJs-3,3,8,8-tetramethoxytricyclo[5.3.0.0 2,6 ]decane as white 
plates, m.p. 173-174 °C. The yield is 19.3 g (30%).

stirred mixture under reflux for 1 hour. Cool, separate the organic layer and 
extract the acid solution with two 40 ml portions of dichloromethane. Com- 
bine the dichloromethane solutions and wash with 50 ml of 10 per cent 
aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and then 50 ml of water. Dry over mag-

7,7-Dichlorobicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one. The reaction is conducted in a 
three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a con- 
denser and a pressure-equalising dropping funnel. A solution of triethylamine 
(96 g, 0.95 mol) in pentane (500 ml) is added over a period of 3.5 hours to a 
refluxing solution of dichloroacetyl chloride (129 g, 0.875 mol) and freshly 
distilled cyclopentadiene (216 ml, 2.62 mol) (Expt 7.24) in pentane (1 litre). 
The reaction is exothermic and precipitation of triethylamine hydrochloride 
is instantaneous. The mixture is refluxed for an additional 2 hours and then 
allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The mixture is treated with 
cold water and the organic phase extracted successively with 5 per cent 
aqueous hydrochloric acid and with several portions of 5 per cent aqueous 
sodium hydrogen carbonate and then dried over anydrous sodium sulphate. 
After removal of the solvent in vacuo, distillation gives 150.6g of a fraction 
boiling between 50 and 65 °C/2 mmHg which still contains an appreciable 
amount of dicyclopentadiene. Redistillation gives 119.2g (77%) of 7,7-di- 
chlorobicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one (b.p. 67-68 °C/2 mmHg, n 2 , 5 1.5136)

Bicyclo[3.2.0]hept-2-en-6-one. A solution of freshly distilled tributyltin 
hydride (31 g, 0.108 mol) (1) in cyclohexane (30 ml) is placed in a three-necked 
flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a nitrogen inlet tube and a dropping 
funnel. The flask is flushed with nitrogen. The solution is refluxed while a

cyclohexane containing &lt;x,a'-azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) (0.1 g, 0.6mmol) 
is gradually added. After completion of the addition the mixture is distilled to

Note. (1) Tributyltin hydride is prepared according to a slight modification of the 
literature procedure. A solution of lithium aluminium hydride (4.75 g, 0.136 mol) in 
anhydrous ether (400 ml) is placed in a three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped 
with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, a nitrogen inlet tube and a pressure-equalising 
dropping funnel containing tributyltin chloride (100 g, 0.308 mol). The system is 
flushed with nitrogen and then tributyltin chloride is added dropwise at a rate which 
maintains a gentle reflux of ether. The resulting mixture is stirred for 7 hours. Careful 
addition of water to the cooled mixture destroys the excess lithium aluminium 
hydride. The ether solution is decanted, washed with three 100 ml portions of water 
and dried over calcium sulphate. Evaporation of the solvent and distillation under 
high vacuum gives 68 g (78%) of tributyltin hydride (b.p. 68-69 °C/0.3 mmHg, nl 5

Method A. Place a solution of 5 g of pure, 1,4-naphthoquinone (1) in 1 15 ml 
of dry thiophene-free benzene (CAUTION) in the appropriate sized photo- 
chemical reactor vessel (Section 2.17.5, p. Ill; note also the precautions to be 
observed for photochemical reactions) fitted with a 100-W medium pressure 
mercury arc lamp surrounded by Pyrex cooling jackets. Stir the solution by 
means of a magnetic follower bar and pass dry nitrogen through the solution 
for 10 minutes before switching on the lamp; adjust the nitrogen flow to a 
slow trickle and continue irradiation for about 6 hours, by which time a 
quantity of the solid dimer will have separated from the solution. Switch off 
the lamp, remove the lamp insert and collect the solid by suction filtration 
and wash with a little benzene. Gently remove and collect any of the solid 
which may have separated on the surface of the lamp insert and thoroughly 
clean the latter with a little acetone on a paper tissue before replacing the ben- 
zene filtrate in the reactor and continuing the irradiation process. Repeat 
these operations as appropriate and collect the dimer over a total irradiation 
period of about 28 hours; about 0.84 g of solid, m.p. 243-246 °C (decomp.) (2), 
is obtained. Recrystallise from 150-160 ml of glacial acetic acid with the aid of 
a little decolourising carbon and dry the pale straw-coloured crystals in a 
desiccator over solid sodium hydroxide pellets; the yield of pure naphtho- 
quinone dimer, m.p. 245-249 °C (decomp.), is 0.62 g (12%). 

Method B. Place a solution of 2.5 g of pure 1,4-naphthoquinone (1) in 50 ml 
of dry thiophene-free benzene in a 50-ml round-bottomed flask and pass a 
slow stream of dry nitrogen through the solution for 5 minutes. Insert a 
lightly greased stopper in the flask taking care that the solution does not 
penetrate the joint. Place the flask in a sunny position - if situated in the open 
air wrap some aluminium foil around the stopper to prevent the possibility of 
rainwater seeping through the joint into the reaction mixture. Solid slowly

separates from the solution over a period of days; collect the product by suc- 
tion filtration, wash with a little benzene and dry. Return the filtrate to the 
flask, flush with dry nitrogen and place in the sunlight until a further portion 
of solid is ready for collection. The amount of material obtained in a given 
period is dependent on light conditions; typically, a total of 0.33 g (13%) of 
crude naphthoquinone photodimer, m.p. 241-246 °C (decomp.), has been 
obtained during a 31 -day irradiation period (April-May). 

Notes. (1) Technical grade naphthoquinone may be purified as described in Expt 

6.128. 

(2) The melting point is best observed on a microscope-hot stage apparatus.

CHAPTER 8 

SELECTED HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS 



The methods of preparation which are considered in this chapter involve, prin- 
cipally, ring-forming reactions leading to a restricted and subjective selection of 
various typical and interesting heterocyclic systems. These cyclic systems may be 
classified as (a) saturated or partly unsaturated heterocyclic, or (b) hetero- 
aromatic, according to their physical, chemical and spectroscopic properties and 
to the reactivity of the functional groups attached to the ring atoms. In this way 
such properties and reactivity are broadly related to those of alicyclic and aro- 
matic compounds. 

In this chapter the material is subdivided first on the basis of ring size 
(8.1, three-membered; 8.2, four-membered; etc.) and thence according to the ring- 
forming reaction type. Where appropriate, routes to selected target molecules 
are analysed in a retrosynthetic sense. The reader's attention is drawn to a book 
on heterocyclic chemistry 1 which includes a more detailed theoretical treatment 
of the kinetic and thermodynamic factors of these ring-forming reactions; this 
book also cites many examples of heterocyclic compounds which play an im- 
portant role in biological systems. 

The spectroscopic features of the heterocyclic ring systems may be inferred 
from the data noted in the correlation tables (Appendices 2, 3 and 4). Since the 
range of one- and multi-heteroatom systems is so diverse, a generalised discus- 
sion of these features would be too extensive for the scope of this book. Illustrat- 
ive and descriptive accounts are included in appropriate preparative sections. 



8.1 THREE-MEMBERED HETEROCYCLES 

The parent saturated three-membered ring systems containing nitrogen, or 
oxygen, or sulphur as the heteroatom are known as aziridine (1), oxirane (2) and 
thiirane (3).

Four illustrative methods for the synthesis of these systems or their substituted 
analogues are as follows. 

1. Intramolecular cyclisation of a 1,2- Afunctional compound. 

2. Insertion of a methylene group into a carbon-heteroatom double bond. 

3. Insertion of a heteroatom into a carbon-carbon double bond. 

4. Heteroatom exchange.

heteroatom bond may be depicted as follows.

The reagent equivalent therefore requires an anionic site at the heteroatom, and 
a good leaving group at the vicinal position. 

An illustrative example of oxirane formation by the action of alkali on a 
j8-halohydrin is to be found in the reaction sequence involved in the Darzens 
glycidic ester synthesis (Section 5.7.6, p. 598). Three target molecules, namely 2- 
phenylaziridine (4), methyl (S)-thiiranecarboxylate (5) and cyclooctene sulphide 
(6), are selected here to exemplify this intramolecular cyclisation reaction type.

In the case of 2-phenylaziridine (4) the leaving group may originate from the 
hydroxyl function of 2-amino-l-phenylethanol by treatment with sulphuric acid 
to convert it into a sulphate ester which is then cyclised by treatment with base 2 
(Expt 8.1).

This method is generally useful for the formation of various substituted aziri- 
dines by suitable selection from a range of readily available alkanolamines. 

The formation of methyl (S)-thiiranecarboxylate (5) is of interest, 3 since in 
this case the leaving group is a diazo residue originating from an amino group. 
The starting material is therefore the chiral amino acid ester, methyl (K)-cystein- 
ate, and the stereoelectronic requirements of the reaction lead to an optically 
pure product of predictable stereoisomeric form (Expt 8.2).

A further example of this general type of reaction is provided by the synthesis 
of cyclooctene sulphide (6). 4 Here an alkene is converted into an adduct with 
succinimide-JV-sulphenyl chloride (reaction formulated in full in Expt 8.3), 
which is reduced with lithium aluminium hydride at — 78 °C to form the 
product.

CAUTION: All three-membered nitrogen heterocycles must be handled with 
great care as they may be highly toxic, and frequently are foul smelling. All 
operations therefore should be conducted in an efficient fume cupboard and dis- 
posable plastic gloves must be worn. 

An aqueous solution of 2-amino-l-phenylethanol (0.5 mol) is neutralised 
to a methyl red end-point with 50 per cent aqueous sulphuric acid, followed 
by the addition of a further equal volume of aqueous acid. Water is removed 
by heating the solution at 10-15 mmHg, finally at 130 °C. The product crys- 
tallises and is coarsely ground and heated at 120-130 °C under reduced pres- 
sure to constant weight. 

The conversion of the sulphate ester (0.5 mol) into the aziridine is carried 
out by dissolving it in 1 litre of 2 m sodium hydroxide held at 0°C, and then 
slowly heating the resulting solution in an oil bath. At approximately 90 °C, 
the aziridine product separates from the solution as an upper layer. The reac- 
tion mixture is then steam distilled until a fresh portion of the distillate gives a 
neutral reaction. The product is separated from the aqueous distillate and 
dried over potassium hydroxide pellets. Fractional distillation using a 24- 
inch Podbielniak tantalum spiral column affords a 90 per cent yield of 2- 
phenylaziridine, b.p. 94-94 °C/10 mmHg. Gas-liquid chromatography 
analysis through a 10-ft column of 20 per cent Carbowax 20M reveals a single

electric hot plate so that the oil bath is maintained at a constant temperature 
of 55 °C for 60 hours and during this period stir the reaction mixture rapidly 
(1). Pour the reaction mixture on to ice, separate the organic phase and 
extract the aqueous solution with one 20 ml portion of dichloromethane. 
Wash the combined organic phases successively with four 20 ml portions of 
water, two 10 ml portions of a saturated solution of sodium metabisulphite 
and finally two 20 ml portions of water. Dry the organic phase over anhyd-

Note. (1) The reaction may be monitored by observing the diminution of carbonyl 
absorption in the infrared spectrum of successive samples withdrawn from the organic 
phase, after allowing the dichloromethane to evaporate from a portion placed on a 
sodium chloride plate. Alternatively samples of the reaction medium may be analysed 
by g.l.c. using a 10 per cent Carbowax column on Chromosorb W held at 150 °C with 
a nitrogen carrier gas flow rate of 40 ml/minute; benzaldehyde has t R 2 minutes and

The epoxidation reaction is achieved most conveniently by employing m- 
chloroperbenzoic acid (or perbenzoic acid) in a solvent such as chloroform. The 
use of other peracids, such as peracetic acid or pertrifluoroacetic acid, give lower 
yields of the oxirane since the oxide may be readily cleaved to form the mono- 
ester of the diol (e.g. Section 5.4.5, p. 547). 

The regioselectivity of this reaction in the case of certain dienes is of interest, 
since it has been found that the most highly substituted double bond is preferen- 
tially attacked, for example as in the mono-epoxidation of 1,2-dimethylcyclo- 
hexa-l,4-diene 9 (formed by the Birch reduction of o-xylene, Section 7.5, p. 1 1 14). 

rr Me _ fY Me _ 

It should be noted that although oxiranes (8) and (9) are chiral, this epoxida- 
tion methodology gives the racemate since no chiral inducing agent is present. 

However, the asymmetric synthesis of optically active oxiranes has been the 
subject of much research activity in recent years. This arises from the fact that 
the synthesis of stereoisomerically pure structural units, required for the total 
synthesis of a range of biologically active compounds, may be effected by using 
the many ring-opening reactions of chiral oxiranes (e.g. reduction, acidic 
hydrolysis, base-catalysed reactions, reaction with organometallic compounds, 
etc.). In particular the asymmetric epoxidation of allylic alcohols with t-butyl 
hydroperoxide in the presence of titanium(iv) isopropoxide-diethyl tartrate 
catalyst is a significant and important step forward in this methodology (the 
Sharpless epoxidation reaction). A preparative example, for which precise experi- 
mental details have been published, 103 is the conversion of (£)-hex-2-en-l-ol 
into (2S,3S)-3-propyloxiranemethanol in 96.8 per cent enantiomeric purity 
using diethyl (2R,3 R)-( + )-tartrate [(K,K)-DET]; the enantiomeric oxirane is 
obtained by the use of diethyl ( — )-tartrate.

This reaction has now been applied to a very great number of substituted 
allylic alcohols, and the mechanistic and stereoisomeric features of the reaction 
are becoming clearer. 1 ' In broad outline, it would appear that the initial step is 
an alkoxy-exchange reaction between two alkoxy residues in the titanium com- 
plex and the two hydroxyl groups in the tartrate ester, thus:

8.1 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Subsequently the remaining isopropoxide residues in the resulting complex (11) 
undergo exchange with the hydroxyl group of the allylic alcohol and the 
hydroxyl group of the peroxide to give the complex (12); further coordination 
activates the peroxide and the topography of this complex (13) determines the 
favourable enantioselective transfer of oxygen to the carbon-carbon double 
bond to give complex (14). The epoxidised allylic alcohol and the t-butyl alcohol 
are then released by further exchange reactions with the allylic alcohol and per- 
oxide.

The methodology used for the asymmetric epoxidation of geraniol to give 
(10), (2S,3S)-epoxygeraniol (Expt 8.6, cognate preparation), illustrates a general 
procedure which employs 1.5 equivalents of t-butyl hydroperoxide with cata- 
lytic amounts (&lt;10%) of titanium(iv) isopropoxide and of diethyl tartrate. 10b 
The success of this procedure depends on the presence of 3A or 4A molecular 
sieves since moisture, from no matter what source, contributes to a lowering of 
enantioselectivity and a slowing of reaction rate.

Catalytic asymmetric epoxidation of (E)-3,7-dimethylocta-2,6-dien-l-ol 
(geraniol). l0b Preparation of anhydrous t-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) in di- 
chloromethane. CAUTION (1). Solutions of TBHP in dichloromethane are 
prepared as described previously for toluene solutions with minor modifica- 
tions. 102 Two litres of aqueous 70 per cent TBHP (2) and 2 litres of dichloro- 
methane are shaken in a separatory funnel. The lower, organic phase is 
transferred to a 5-litre flask fitted with a heavier-than-water solvent Dean- 
Stark trap (Ace Glass Co.) with condenser. Although the literature authors 
report that they have never experienced a problem with this procedure, they 
advise that all heating should be done behind an adequate blast shield in a well- 
ventilated fume hood. After addition of a few boiling chips, the mixture is 
brought to a gentle reflux by using a heating mantle set on a low voltage. 
Periodically the collected water is removed from the trap. After 10 hours 
about 50 ml have been removed, and no more water is observed in the 
azeotrope. The TBHP solution (c. 2.5 litres) is divided into two batches, and 
each is finally dried in a refrigerator for several hours (usually overnight) over 
200-300 g of activated 3 A sieve pellets (3) either in a flask covered with cello- 
phane or in a polyethylene bottle. The solutions (about 50% v/v TBHP, 
5-6 m) are then transferred to high density polyethylene bottles and stored 
over activated 3A molecular sieve pellets at 0-5 °C. When properly capped, 
polyethylene bottles develop negative pressure upon cooling in the refrigera- 
tor and compress. Such solutions have been stored for months without loss of 
effectiveness and only slight loss of titre (5-10%, possibly due to constant use, 
and thus warming). Assay of the solution is effected by iodometric titration as 
follows. An 0.1 m aqueous sodium thiosulphate solution is prepared (12.4g of 
sodium thiosulphate pentahydrate with enough water to make 500 ml suffices 
for 15 to 20 titrations), and 50 ml of this solution is placed in a 50-ml gradu- 
ated burette. A 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 25 ml of propan-2-ol 
and 1 ml of glacial acetic acid. To this is added 10 ml of a freshly prepared, 
cooled solution of 20 g of sodium iodide in 100 ml of warm propan-2-ol. After 
addition of 0.25 ml of anhydrous TBHP/dichloromethane solution (4), the 
mixture is heated to reflux (with stirring on a hot plate) and refluxed for 30- 
45 seconds. Failure to reflux the solution will result in a low titre. After dilu- 
tion with 100 ml of distilled water, the warm solution is titrated rapidly with 
the 0.1 m sodium thiosulphate (25-30 ml required) to the disappearance of the

yellow iodine colour. Starch indicator may be used towards the end of the 
titration to enhance the end-point. The concentration is calculated according 
to the equation [(molarity of titrant) x (ml of titrant)/(ml of TBHP solu- 
tion) x 2], and should be in the range 5-6 m. The active oxygen content of a 
5.0 m (45wt%) TBHP/dichloromethane solution is about 7wt per cent). 
Solutions of lower molarity are obtained either by dilution just prior to titra- 
tion or by addition of less than 70 per cent TBHP at the start of the pro- 
cedure. In any case, a flask size should be selected which ensures that the 
liquid remains above the top of the heating mantle throughout the azeotropic 
process, with the addition of more dichloromethane if necessary. 

(2S,3S)-Epoxygeraniol. A mixture of powdered, commercially activated 4A 
molecular sieves (5) (1.8 g, Aldrich, 15-20 wt % based on substrate) and 
100 ml of dichloromethane (6) is cooled to - 10 °C (7). (2K,3K)-( + )-Diethyl 
tartrate (8) (1.00 g, 4.8mmol), titanium(iv) isopropoxide (9) (0.91 g, 
3.2 mmol), and t-butyl hydroperoxide (4) (15.6 ml, 97 mmol, 6.2 M in dichloro- 
methane) are added sequentially. After 10 minutes, the mixture is cooled to 
— 20 °C and freshly distilled geraniol (10.0 g, 65 mmol, in 10 ml of dichloro- 
methane) is added dropwise, with vigorous overhead stirring, over a 15 minute 
period. 

After 45 minutes of stirring at — 20 °C to — 15 °C, the reaction is warmed 
to °C (5 minutes) and quenched with water [20 ml, c. 20 times the weight of 
Ti(OPr') 4 used in the reaction]. Upon warming to room temperature (10 
minutes), phase separation is apparent (aqueous suspension above a clear to 
slightly cloudy organic phase). Without separation, hydrolysis of tartrates is 
effected by adding 4.5 ml of a 30 per cent aqueous solution of sodium hydrox- 
ide saturated with sodium chloride. After 10 minutes of vigorous stirring, 
sudden, dramatic phase separation occurs. The lower (organic) phase is 
removed and combined with two extractions of the aqueous phase (dichloro- 
methane, 2 x 10 ml) (10). The combined organic phases are dried over mag- 
nesium sulphate and filtered through analytical grade Celite to give a clear, 
colourless solution, which turns bluish (Ti0 2 ) on standing (11). Concentra- 
tion, followed by Kugelrohr distillation (140 °C, 1.0/mmHg) gives (2S,3S)- 
epoxygeraniol as a colourless oil [10.95 g, 99%, purity c.95% by n.m.r. (12), 
[a]^ 5 -5.3°(c3.0inCHCl 3 )]. 

Notes. (1) The literature authors note that this procedure has been carried out many 
times without incident. However, they warn that solutions of oxidants and oxidisable 
substances are potentially hazardous and possibly subject to violent decomposition 
by adventitious catalysts. They state that the following rules should be applied when 
handling solutions of TBHP. The first rule is never to add a strong acid (not even a 
drop) to hjgh strength TBHP solutions. The second rule is never to add transition- 
metal salts known to be good autoxidation catalysts to high strength TBHP solutions 
(Mn, Fe and Co are particularly bad). Alkyl hydroperoxides are sensitive to metal- 
catalysed radical-chain decomposition. Among other things, this produces oxygen 
gas. The third rule is never to work with pure TBHP and avoid using high strength 
solutions of it whenever possible. They do not recommend storing TBHP solutions in 
glass bottles due to the slight danger of gas evolution. Instead they recommend high 
density polyethylene bottles, even though there may be some solvent migration 
through the walls of the bottle.

Chemical Co.

SELECTED HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS 8.1 



(3) Activation of crushed or pelleted 3 A molecular sieves involves heating in a vacuum 
oven at 160°C and 0.05 mm pressure for at least 3 hours. 

(4) Cold stock solutions of TBHP in dichloromethane should be warmed to room 
temperature prior to opening (warm water baths are convenient), in order to minimise 
exposure to moisture. Somewhat more than the required amount of solution should 
then be dispensed into a small flask or graduated cylinder containing activated 3A or 
4A sieve pellets and stoppered. After a few minutes, the desired volume of solution is 
transferred to the reaction flask, either by syringe, addition funnel, or direct addition. 
Syringe needles should never be inserted into any stock solution of TBHP which is to 
be stored. 

(5) Preactivated, powdered 4A sieves are available from Aldrich Chemical Co. 

(6) Dichloromethane (EM Reagent) is not distilled but is stored over activated 3A 
molecular sieves. 4A sieves should not be used since pressurisation of bottles of di- 
chloromethane containing 4A sieves has been observed. 

(7) The flask used for this reaction is three-necked and round-bottomed, fitted with an 
overhead mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and either a septum or an addition funnel. 
The internal temperature is carefully monitored. All equipment is either flame dried 
under vacuum or cooled under vacuum after storage in an oven at 125 °C. The reac- 
tion is carried out under an inert atmosphere (nitrogen or argon) in order to exclude 
atmospheric moisture. All additions are made either by addition funnel or syringe. 
Cooling is effected by using a water-ethylene glycol (70:80) dry ice bath. 

(8) Diethyl tartrate is used as obtained from Aldrich Chemical Co. 

(9) Titanium(iv) isopropoxide is distilled under vacuum and stored under an inert 
atmosphere. Neither the tartrate ester nor the titanium isopropoxide should be stored 
over sieves. Reagents handled by syringe are measured by weight rather than by 
volume. 

(10) During any separations, if the phases do not immediately separate, c. 5 per cent 
v/v methanol should be added. After very brief shaking, clean phase separation gener- 
ally occurs, leaving an almost clear organic phase below a milky aqueous phase. 

(11) If the mixture is allowed to stand for a longer period after the addition of magne- 
sium sulphate, no titanium will be found in solution after filtration. 

(12) The c. 5 per cent impurity seen in the n.m.r. is related to an impurity in the 
geraniol, possibly a double bond isomer. 

8.1.4 HETEROATOM EXCHANGE 

Since the above methods provide a range of procedures for the formation of 
oxiranes, the exchange reaction of oxygen to sulphur is a convenient method for 
thiirane synthesis. A simple procedure involves stirring the oxirane in toluene 
solution with a potassium thiocyanate-on-silica gel reagent. 8 A drawback of this 
reaction is that the rate is slow in the case of disubstituted oxiranes. The reaction 
is highly stereospecific in that, for example, trans-oxiranes yield frans-thiiranes. 
A probable mechanism is given below and involves a double inversion process 
which explains the high stereospecificity.

SELECTED HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS S.2 



The retrosynthetic analysis given above involves an initial disconnection at the 
N — C 4 bond, although it should be pointed out that disconnections at some of 
the other bonds have been variously explored in the literature. The synthesis of 
the reagent equivalent (22) of the synthon (21) may be seen to require reaction of 
a doubly protected p-hydroxyphenylglycine derivative with 3-bromopropanoyl 
chloride in the presence of base. The protection sequence (formulated in Expt 
8.7) for the amino acid is: (i) esterification of the carboxyl group; (ii) conversion 
of the amino group into a benzylidene derivative; (iii) benzylation of the pheno- 
lic hydroxyl group; and (iv) deprotection of the amino group by hydrolysis. The 
protected amino acid is finally isolated as the toluene-p-sulphonate salt. 

The cyclisation of (22) to the /Mactam system, which is a thermodynamically 
unfavourable reaction, is promoted by using sodium hydride as the base in a 
dichloromethane-dimethylformamide solvent system at high dilution.

centrated sulphuric acid (8 ml). The resulting yellow solution is heated at 
reflux for 2 hours, cooled to °C and neutralised with concentrated aqueous 
ammonia solution. The precipitated product is then collected by filtration, 
washed with cold water, and recrystallised from aqueous ethanol to give 4.9 g

dimethylaniline (2.4 g, 19.9 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (65 ml) at -20 °C 
(ice-methanol bath) is added over 20 minutes 3-bromopropanoyl chloride 
(1.2 g, 6.3 mmol) in dry dichloromethane (5 ml). After completion of the addi- 
tion, the reaction mixture is allowed to come to room temperature and stirred 
for 1.5 hours. The clear solution is diluted with dichloromethane-ether (2:1) 
and washed successively with 1 M hydrochloric acid, 5 per cent sodium hydro- 
gen carbonate solution and saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic 
layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated to give 2.5 g

methyl acetate-heptane-ether. 

Ethyl a-[(p-benzyloxy)phenyl]-2-oxo-l-azetidineacetate. To a suspension of 
0.375 g (7.8 mmol) of a 50 per cent mineral oil dispersion of sodium hydride 
(prewashed with pentane) and dry dimethylformamide (15 ml) in dichloro- 
methane (55 ml) is added over 3.5 hours a solution containing the foregoing 
substituted glycine ethyl ester (2.98 g, 7.1 mmol) and dry dimethylformamide 
(15 ml) in dry dichloromethane (55 ml). After completion of the addition, the 
reaction mixture is stirred for 3 hours at room temperature and then 
quenched with a saturated ammonium chloride solution (10 ml). The result- 
ing mixture is diluted with ether and dichloromethane. The organic phase is 
separated, washed with water and with saturated aqueous sodium chloride 
and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate. Removal of the solvent 
under reduced pressure gives an orange oil which is crystallised from ether- 
hexane to give 1.9 g (80%) of white solid product, m.p. 52-54 °C (1).

To illustrate the two alternative (2 + 2) cycloaddition processes, three target

For the synthesis of compounds (23) and (24), bond formation is between N to 
C 4 and C 2 to C 3 ; for compound (25) bond formation is between N to C 2 and C 3 
to C 4 . These reactions may proceed in two steps via a dipolar intermediate (for- 
mulated below) rather than in the pericyclic sense. 

Compound (23) (Expt 8.8) is formed by the reaction of but-1-enyl acetate 
with chlorosulphonyl isocyanate (Section 4.2.77, p. 425). 13 The reaction inter- 
mediate is the JV-chlorosulphonyl derivative which is subjected to reduction 
with alkaline sodium sulphide to yield the product which is isolated as a cis: 
trans (1:1) mixture. But-1-enyl acetate is readily synthesised by acetylation of the 
enol form of butanal.

Compound (24) (Expt 8.8, cognate preparation) is similarly prepared from 
chlorosulphonyl isocyanate and methylenecyclohexane followed by reduction 
with sodium sulphite. 14 Chlorosulphonyl isocyanate has been widely used in 
cycloaddition reactions of this type to yield /^-lactams having a range of func- 
tional groups. ' 5 These functional groups enable further structural modifications 
to be carried out leading to many mono- and bicyclic compounds containing the 
j8-lactam structural feature. A straightforward example is the conversion of 4- 
acetoxyazetidin-2-one (26) into clavam (28) (Expt 8.9). Compound (26), pre- 
pared from vinyl acetate and chlorosulphonyl isocyanate followed by reductive 
removal of the chlorosulphonyl group, 16 or obtained commercially, is submitted 
to a Lewis-acid-catalysed displacement of the acetoxy group by reaction with 2- 
bromoethanol to give 4-(2-bromoethoxy)azetidin-2-one (27). Cyclisation to the 
bicyclic system is then effected by using the non-nucleophilic base 1,8-diazabi- 
cyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU).

An illustration of a cycloaddition reaction resulting in the formation of the 
N — C 2 and C 3 — C 4 bonds is the reaction of 2-chlorophenylketene (29) with 
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, to give 3-chloro-l-cyclohexyl-4-cyclohexylimino-3- 
phenylazetidin-2-one (25) (Expt 8.10). 17 The ketene is generated in situ from 2- 
chloro-2-phenylacetyl chloride by the action of triethylamine (cf. Expt 7.25).

ing mixture is diluted with pentane (100 ml), washed with water, saturated 
aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and water, and dried over anhydrous 
sodium sulphate. Evaporation of the solvent gives a colourless oil, which is

the product has a considerably smaller R F value than the starting material. At 
the end of the reaction (usually less than 1 5 minutes) the ether layer is separ- 
ated and dried and evaporated. The products are of greater than 95 per cent

8.3 FIVE-MEMBERED HETEROCYCLES 

The commonest five-membered heteroaromatic compounds containing one 
heteroatom are pyrrole (30), furan (31) and thiophene (32). Their substituted 
derivatives and the substituted derivatives of the corresponding benzo ana- 
logues [indole (33), benzofuran (34) and benzothiophene (35)] are widespread 
naturally-occurring compounds.

portant methods of ring formation, are pyrazole (36), pyrazolone (37), hydan- 
toin (38), oxazolone (39), thiazole (40), benzimidazole (41) and benzotriazole

A useful initial guide to an overall strategy of ring formation is to formulate 
the ring atoms as various skeletal fragments. For example, in the case of the five- 
membered heterocyclic system (43), ring construction may be seen to result from 
the union of the skeletal fragments shown in (44) to (46). With the benzo ana- 
logue (47) a limited selection of possibilities is given by (48) and (49).

This time-honoured view of ring construction preceded the retrosynthetic 
approach; it is still of value since it provides an indication of which bonds could 
be selected for disconnection. The more rigorous application of the principles of 
retrosynthetic analysis leads of course to the formulation of synthons and their 
reagent equivalents. 

A selection of cyclisation reactions is detailed below to exemplify these prin- 
ciples. They are conveniently discussed in relation to the synthesis of com- 
pounds belonging to the following groups of heterocyclic systems. 

1. Pyrroles, furans, thiophenes and pyrazolones from dicarbonyl compounds. 

2. Hydantoins from urea, and thiazoles from thiourea or thioamides. 

3. Oxazolones (and azlactones) from a-amino acids. 

4. Indoles, benzofurans and benzothiophenes. 

5. Benzimidazoles and benzotriazole from o-phenylene diamines.

Synthesis of (53) and (54) proceeds with ease on mixing the relevant reagents 
(Expts 8.14 and 8.15). JV-Methylation of (54) with dimethyl sulphate in the pres- 
ence of alkali gives 2,3-dimethyl-l-phenylpyrazol-5-one (antipyrin), which was 
one of the earliest synthetic antipyretics. 

An example of the Knorr pyrrole synthesis is provided by the formation of 3,5- 
diethoxycarbonyl-2,4-dimethylpyrrole (55). Overall ring construction in this 
case may be related to (46) above. A retrosynthetic analysis involving disconnec- 
tion of the N — C 2 bond, appropriate prototropic shifts, and finally a refro-aldol 
reaction to effect disconnection of the C 3 — C 4 bond, reveals ethyl acetoacetate 
and ethyl a-aminoacetoacetate (ethyl 2-amino-3-oxo-butanoate) (56) as 
reagents. An FGI transform on this latter compound generates the correspond- 
ing nitroso (oximino) compound which may also be derived from ethyl aceto- 
acetate.

In practice the synthesis (Expt 8.16) is a one-pot reaction in which one- half of 
the ethyl acetoacetate is converted to the oximino compound by treatment with

nitrous acid in acetic acid, which is then reduced by the addition of zinc dust. 
The resulting amino compound spontaneously reacts with the remaining ethyl 
acetoacetate to yield the pyrrole derivative (55). 

The Knorr synthesis is generally suitable for the synthesis of a range of substi- 
tuted pyrroles utilising a-aminoketones (or keto esters as illustrated above) with 
carbonyl compounds containing an active methylene group.

Urea may be recognised as a structural unit in 5,5-diphenylhydantoin (57) 
and it constitutes one of the reagents in the synthesis. Although it is not obvious, 
the appropriate reagent equivalent corresponding to the accompanying synthon 
is in fact benzil.

The base-catalysed reaction sequence (formulated in Expt 8.17) is thought to 
proceed via an intermediate heterocyclic pinacol which on acidification yields 
the required hydantoin as a result of a pinacolic rearrangement. The procedure 
is applicable in general to diaryl-l,2-diketones. 

The thiourea fragment may be readily recognised in (58); appropriate discon- 
nection thus reveals a chloroacetone as the other reagent; the synthesis is readily 
effected by heating the two reagents together (Expt 8.18). In a similar manner 
disconnection of 2-aminothiazole (59) reveals thiourea and chloroacetaldehyde; 
in this case the carbonyl reagent is generated in situ from a,/?-dichloroethyl ethyl 
ether (formulated in Expt 8.19).

each addition until all the chloride has reacted. Transfer the solution to a 
beaker and rinse the conical flask with a little water. Place a few grams of 
crushed ice in the solution and add concentrated hydrochloric acid slowly 
and with stirring until the mixture is acid to Congo red paper. Collect the 
resulting crystalline precipitate of benzoylglycine, which is contaminated 
with a little benzoic acid, upon a Buchner funnel, wash with cold water and 
drain well. Place the solid in a beaker with 100 ml of carbon tetrachloride, 
cover the beaker with a watch glass and boil gently for 10 minutes (fume cup- 
board); this extracts any benzoic acid which may be present. Allow the mix- 
ture to cool slightly, filter under gentle suction and wash the product on the 
filter with 10-20 ml of carbon tetrachloride. Recrystallise the dried product 
from boiling water (about 500 ml) with the addition of a little decolourising 
charcoal if necessary, filter through a hot-water funnel and allow to crystal- 
lise. Collect the benzoylglycine in a Buchner funnel and dry it in an oven. The 
yield is 45 g (76%), m.p. 187 °C. 

4-Benzylidene-2-phenyloxazol-5-one. Place a mixture of 27 g (26 ml, 0.25 mol) 
of redistilled benzaldehyde, 45 g (0.25 mol) of benzoylglycine, 77 g (71.5 ml, 
0.75 mol) of acetic anhydride and 20.5 g (0.25 mol) of anhydrous sodium 
acetate in a 500-ml conical flask and heat on an electric hotplate with con- 
stant shaking. As soon as the mixture has liquefied completely, transfer the 
flask to a water bath and heat for 2 hours. Then add 100 ml of ethanol slowly 
to the contents of the flask and allow the mixture to stand overnight. Filter 
the crystalline product with suction, wash with two 25 ml portions of ice-cold 
alcohol and then wash with two 25 ml portions of boiling water: dry at 
100 °C. The yield of almost pure oxazolone, m.p. 165-166 °C, is 40g (64%). 
Recrystallisation from benzene raises the m.p. to 167-168 °C. 

8.3.4 INDOLES. BENZOFURANS AND BENZOTHIOPHENES 

The four target molecules are indole [(63), R 1 = R 2 = H], 5-chloro-2-phenyl- 
indole [(63), R 1 = Ph, R 2 = CI], benzofuran (64) and 5-chloro-3-methylbenzo- 
thiophene (65). The retrosynthetic analyses shown below individually illustrate

In the synthesis of indole [(63), R 1 = H, R 2 = H], the cyclisation step is effected 
when JV-formyl-o-toluidine [JV-(2-methylphenyl)-formamide] is treated with 
strong base (e.g. potassium alkoxide or sodamide) at high temperatures. 19 The 
reaction, the Madelung indole synthesis, may be regarded mechanistically as an 
intramolecular Claisen condensation. In the preparative example (Expt 8.22) a 
simplified procedure is described in which the somewhat hazardous preparation 
of a potassium alkoxide from potassium metal and the alcohol is avoided by 
using a mixture of sodium methoxide and anhydrous potassium acetate. The 
yields are however poor; there is extensive loss of carbon monoxide and about 
half the starting material is recovered as the parent amine. Furthermore, the 
reaction is limited in that the presence of halogen or alkoxy ring substituents 
causes the reaction to fail, and the use of amides having JV-aroyl or branched N- 
alkanoyl groups [e.g. (63), R 1 = Ar or Bu l ], leading to the corresponding 2-aryl- 
or 2-alkylindoles, gives poor yields. This drawback has been overcome by the 
use of 2 or 3 molar equivalents of butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran at — 20 to 
+25 °C, followed by standing overnight at room temperature. 20 The reaction 
sequence is formulated in Expt 8.23 which describes the preparation of 5-chloro- 
2-phenylindole. 

The analysis depicted for (64) reveals that the synthesis of benzofuran in- 
volves the conversion of salicylaldehyde into the corresponding aryloxyacetic 
acid by reaction with sodium chloroacetate in the presence of alkali, followed by 
heating with a mixture of acetic anhydride, acetic acid and sodium acetate (Expt 
8.24). The ensuing cyclisation may be regarded as an internal Perkin reaction 
(Section 6.12.3, p. 1036) accompanied by a decarboxylative dehydration step. 

The analysis for (65) illustrates the value of disconnecting the bond which 
joins the aromatic ring to a side-chain or functional substituent. The synthesis 
therefore involves reaction of thiophenol with a-chloroacetone under basic con- 
ditions and cyclisation of the resulting substituted ketone by heating with phos- 
phorus pentoxide (Expt 8.25). 

An important general method for the preparation of substituted indoles (low 
yields with indole itself), known as the Fischer indole synthesis, consists of heat- 
ing the phenylhydrazone of an aldehyde, ketone, or keto acid in the presence of 



1157 



8.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



an acid catalyst. Zinc chloride, hydrochloric acid or glacial acetic acid may be 
used, but polyphosphoric acid is often preferred. Thus acetophenone phenyl- 
hydrazone [(66), R 1 = H, R 2 = Ph] gives 2-phenylindole [(66), R 1 = H, R 2 = 
Ph] (Expt 8.26). The reaction sequence involves an intramolecular condensa- 
tion with the elimination of ammonia and the mechanism of the reaction is out- 
lined below (see also the synthesis of tryptophan, Expt 5.184). 




(67) 



A further interesting application is the preparation of 1, 2,3,4- tetrahydrocarb- 
azole (69) (Expt 8.26, cognate preparation) which is formed when phenyl- 
hydrazine is added to a boiling solution of cyclohexanone in acetic acid; the 
phenylhydrazone (68), intermediately produced, undergoes ring closure directly.

Indole. Prepare a solution of sodium methoxide in 125 ml of anhydrous 
methanol using 5.75 g (0.25 mol) of sodium in a 250-ml flask fitted with a

(0.25 mol) of JV-formyl-o-toluidine. Then add rapidly 50g (0.51 mol) of 
coarsely ground, freshly fused potassium acetate (1) and heat under reflux 
with shaking until all has dissolved. Remove the methanol under reduced 
pressure (rotary evaporator), transfer the flask to a fume cupboard and fit a 
still-head and condenser set for downward distillation. Surround the flask 
with a bath of molten Wood's metal (Section 2.13) and raise the temperature 
steadily to about 300-350 °C. The subsequent reaction is accompanied by the 
distillation of o-toluidine and the evolution of carbon monoxide; continue to 
heat until no further distillation occurs (about 30 minutes) and finally remove 
traces of o-toluidine by carefully applying partial vacuum. Remove the heat- 
ing bath, allow the flask to cool and decompose the residue by adding 100 ml 
of water and steam distilling. Colourless plates of indole separate from the 
cooled distillate; make the latter slightly acidic with hydrochloric acid, collect 
the crystals by suction filtration and wash them with a little cold water. The 
yield of indole, m.p. 48-49 °C, is 5 g (17%). A purer specimen, m.p. 52 °C, may 
be obtained by crystallisation from light petroleum, b.p. 40-60 °C. 

Note. (1) Heat the potassium acetate in a porcelain dish until a tranquil melt is 
obtained, and allow to cool in a desiccator (cf. anhydrous sodium acetate, Section

tion with 60 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and steam distil to remove

ring to aid the hydrolysis of acetic anhydride. Extract the solution with three

The synthesis is effected by simply heating the reagents together. 2-Methylbenz-

Disconnection of benzotriazole (42) is almost trivial; in fact conversion of the

in 1 5 ml of water in one portion. The reaction mixture becomes warm and 
within 2-3 minutes reaches a temperature of about 85 °C and then begins to 
cool while the colour changes from deep red to pale brown. Continue stirring 
for 15 minutes, by which time the temperature will have dropped to 35^40 °C, 
and then thoroughly chill in an ice-water bath for 30 minutes. Collect by 
vacuum filtration the pale brown solid which separates and wash with three 
30 ml portions of ice-cold water. Dissolve the solid in about 130 ml of boiling 
water, add decolourising charcoal, filter and allow the filtrate to cool to about 
50 °C before adding a few crystals of the crude benzotriazole which have been 
retained for seeding. Allow the mixture to attain room temperature slowly (to 
avoid separation of the material as an oil) and then thoroughly chill in ice and 
collect the benzotriazole which separates as pale straw-coloured needles, m.p. 
99-100 °C. A second crop may be obtained by concentrating the filtrate. The 
yield is about 8 g (67%). The benzotriazole crystallises much more readily 
from benzene (c. 55 ml) but the material is still slightly coloured. A pure white 
product can be obtained by sublimation at 90-95 °C at 0.2 mmHg. 

Note. (1) o-Phenylenediamine is generally contaminated by highly coloured impur- 
ities. A somewhat more pure benzotriazole may be obtained by using purified 
o-phenylenediamine (see Expt 6.49).

As in the five-membered heterocyclic section the discussion of the relevant 
ring-forming reaction is related, as appropriate, to an overall strategy of skeletal 
assembly, and to a more rigorous retrosynthetic analysis. The reactions are con- 
veniently discussed in relation to the synthesis of compounds belonging to the 
following groups of heterocycles. 

1. Pyridines and pyrylium salts. 

2. Pyrones and py rid ones. 

3. Barbituric acid and barbiturates. 

4. Quinolines, isoquinolines and quinoxalines. 

5. Coumarins and chromones. 

8.4.1 PYRIDINES AND PYRYLIUM SALTS 

The two target molecules, which illustrate cyclisation reactions involving substi- 
tuted 1,5-dicarbonyl compounds in the presence of appropriate reagents, are 
diethyl 2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate (85) and 2,4,6-triphenylpyrylium 
fluoroborate (86). The latter is of specific interest since it provides a simple 
example to illustrate a general procedure for the conversion of pyrylium salts 
into pyridinium derivatives; these latter compounds are important reagents for a 
variety of functional group interconversions (see Sections 5.5.6, p. 574, and 
5.15.3, p. 768).

(85) 

In the case of (85) an initial reduction transform to the corresponding 1,4- 
dihydropyridine (87) facilitates recognition of the synthons arising from sub- 
sequent disconnections. This reduction step is legitimate since the reverse oxida- 
tion step in the synthesis is particularly facile owing to mesomeric stabilisation 
of the aromatic ring system. Disconnection of both carbon-nitrogen bonds in 
the 1,4-dihydropyridine, in a manner similar to that formulated for pyrrole 
derivatives, reveals the bis-keto ester (88) and ammonia. Further rational dis- 
connection of the bis-keto ester then finally discloses two molecules of ethyl 
acetoacetate and one of formaldehyde as the other starting materials.

The preparation of (83) (Expt 8.29) is an example of the Hantzsch pyridine 
synthesis. This is a widely used general procedure since considerable structural 
variation in the aldehydic compound (aliphatic or aromatic) and in the 1,3- 
dicarbonyl component (j8-keto ester or /?-diketone) is possible, leading to the 
synthesis of a great range of pyridine derivatives. The precise mechanistic se- 
quence of ring formation may depend on the reaction conditions employed. 
Thus if, as implied in the retrosynthetic analysis above, ethyl acetoacetate and 
the aldehyde are first allowed to react in the presence of a base catalyst (as in 
Expt 8.29), a bis-keto ester [e.g. (88)] is formed by successive Knoevenagel and 
Michael reactions (Section 5.11.6, p. 681). Cyclisation of this 1,5-dione with 
ammonia then gives the dihydropyridine derivative. Under different reaction 
conditions condensation between an aminocrotonic ester and an alkylidene 
acetoacetate may be involved.

Oxidation of the dihydropyridine derivative is most conveniently carried out 
with an aqueous nitric-sulphuric acid mixture. Removal of the ethoxycarbonyl 
groups may be achieved by a stepwise hydrolysis and decarboxylation sequence, 
but the one-step reaction described in Expt 8.29 using soda-lime is convenient. 

The retrosynthetic analysis of 2,4,6-triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoroborate (86), 
involving an initial reduction followed by a disconnection of one carbon-oxygen 
bond (cf. disconnection of 2,5-dimethylfuran, Section 8.3.1, p. 1146), reveals the 
substituted 1,5-dicarbonyl compound (89). Further rational disconnection then 
reveals acetophenone and l,3-diphenylprop-2-en-l-one (chalcone); clearly the 
latter may originate from acetophenone and benzaldehyde (cf. Section 6.12.2, 
p. 1032).

A convenient synthetic procedure 21 (Expt 8.30) involves stirring and warming 
acetophenone and benzaldehyde with boron trifiuoride-etherate; hydrogen is 
evolved during the final oxidation stage which leads to the pyrylium tetra- 
fluoroborate derivative. An alternative method using chalcone, acetophenone 
and fluoroboric acid has been published. 22 2,4,6-Triphenylpyrylium perchlorate 
is formed when chalcone and acetophenone are heated in the presence of per- 
chloric acid 23 ; the perchlorates tend to decompose with explosive violence if not 
handled with care. 

Either the pyrylium tetrafluoroborate or the perchlorate salt may be con- 
verted into the corresponding halide by initial conversion into the pseudobase 
[(90), l,3,5-triphenylpent-2-en-l,5-dione] with dilute alkali, followed by recycli- 
sation in the presence of the hydrogen halide. 24 




All these various pyrylium salts are converted by ammonia, or alkyl, arylkyl 
or aryl primary amines into the corresponding pyridinium salts. 25 The probable 
reaction sequence is given in the illustrative example l-benzyl-2,4,6-triphenyl- 
pyridinium tetrafluoroborate 26 (Expt 8.31). 

The preparations of 2-alkyl- and 2-arylpyridines from pyridine itself are of 
interest in that their syntheses illustrate the activating influence of the ring nitro- 
gen on the 2- and 4-ring carbons and on the 2- and 4-alkyl substituents. A pre- 
parative example to exemplify the former is the synthesis of 2-phenylpyridine by 
the reaction of pyridine with phenyllithium (Expt 8.32). Addition of the organo- 
metallic derivative to the azomethine linkage in pyridine gives an intermediate 
derived from a 1,2-dihydropyridine system. This undergoes thermal elimination 
of lithium hydride to form 2-phenylpyridine. The formation of 2-alkylpyridines 
may be effected similarly using the appropriate alkyllithium.

Activation of alkyl substituents is illustrated by the synthesis of the isomeric 
pentylpyridines (Expt 8.33) and ethyl 2-pyridylacetate (Expt 8.32, cognate pre- 
paration). Thus removal of a proton from the 2-methyl group of 2-methyl- 
pyridine (2-picoline) with the aid of base (e.g. sodamide) gives a mesomerically 

1167

stabilised anion (91) which may then be alkylated with an alkyl halide. Alternat- 
ively, the anion may be reacted with carbon dioxide to give 2-pyridylacetic acid, 
which may be subsequently esterified by treatment with ethanolic hydrogen 
chloride. 




4-Methylpyridine, and even the less reactive 3-methyl derivative, may also be 
alkylated in a similar manner.

Diethyl l,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylate. Cool 52 g (51 ml, 
0.4 mol) of ethyl acetoacetate to C and add 15 ml (0.2 mol) of 40 per cent 
aqueous formaldehyde solution, followed by a few drops of diethylamine as a 
catalyst. Keep the mixture at °C for 6 hours and then at room temperature 
for 40 hours. Separate the lower organic layer, extract the aqueous phase with 
ether and dry the combined organic fractions over anhydrous calcium chlor- 
ide. Remove the ether under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) and 
transfer the residue together with an equal volume of ethanol to a stout 
reagent bottle cooled in an ice bath. Pass a steady stream of ammonia gas 
(from a cylinder) into the solution held at °C for 1 hour, close the bottle with 
a bung securely attached with wire and set the bottle and contents aside at 
room temperature for 40 hours. Filter the resulting yellow solution to remove 
a small quantity of almost colourless material and heat the filtrate on a boil- 
ing water bath in an evaporating dish until most of the ethanol has been 
removed, and then cool and crystallise the residue from about 400 ml of recti- 
fied spirit. The yield of the pale yellow crystalline dihydropyridine derivative 
is 36 g (71%), m.p. 181-183 °C.

it cautiously on a boiling water bath until a vigorous reaction, accompanied 
by much foaming, sets in. When the reaction has moderated continue to heat 
cautiously for 15 minutes until oxidation is complete and a deep red solution 
is obtained. Cool the solution, add 100 ml of water and 100 g of crushed ice, 
and make it distinctly alkaline with concentrated aqueous ammonia solution 
(dO.88). Filter off the solid product, wash it with a little cold water and recrys- 
tallise it from aqueous ethanol. The yield of colourless crystals of the pyridine 
derivative, m.p. 71-72°C, is 22.5 g (64%). 

2,6-Dimethylpyridine. Place an intimate mixture of 10 g (0.04 mol) of the 
above pyridine di-ester and 60g of soda-lime (10-14 mesh) in a 100-ml 
round-bottomed flask fitted with a still-head and condenser arranged for dis- 
tillation. Heat the flask gradually in an oil bath to about 250 °C, and maintain 
this temperature until no further material distils below 105 °C (about 2 hours 
may be required). Remove the oil bath, clean the outside of the flask and con- 
tinue to heat more strongly with a Bunsen burner held in the hand, keeping 
the flame moving over the surface of the flask. Collect the product which now 
distils, and continue to heat strongly until the flask reaches dull red heat and 
no further distillate is obtained. Treat the distillate with potassium hydroxide 
pellets so that the pyridine separates, and isolate the latter by extraction with 
ether. Dry the ether extract over fresh potassium hydroxide pellets, and 
remove the ether and distil the residue at atmospheric pressure . Collect the 
dimethylpyridine as a fraction of b.p. 142-145 °C; the yield is 2.8 g (65%).

CAUTION: As hydrogen is evolved in this reaction the preparation should be 
conducted in a well-vented fume cupboard. 

To a mixture of acetophenone (60 g, 0.5 mol) and benzaldehyde (26.5 g, 
0.25 mol) is added, with stirring, boron trifluoride-etherate (84 g, 0.65 mol); 
the mixture becomes coloured and the temperature rises, often to about 
70 °C. On maintaining the temperature at 100 °C for 2 hours ether distils from 
the reaction mixture. The product of the reaction is a viscous brown oil which 
must be dissolved in acetone (300 ml) and the tetrafluoroborate salt precipi- 
tated by the addition of ether (3 litres). 2,4,6-Triphenylpyrylium tetrafluoro-

The first stage is the preparation of a solution of phenyllithium in dry ether. 
Equip a 1-litre three-necked flask as shown in Fig. 2.60. Flush the apparatus 
with dry, oxygen-free nitrogen gas. Place 7.35 g (1.06 mol) of lithium shavings 

(1) in the flask, and introduce a solution of 78.5 g (52.5 ml, 0.5 mol) of dry, 
redistilled bromobenzene in 250 ml of anhydrous ether into the dropping 
funnel. Start the stirrer. Run in about 2 ml of the solution; when the reaction 
starts, as indicated by an initial cloudiness, add the remainder at such a rate 
that the solvent refluxes gently (about 45 minutes). Finally, add 50 ml of 
anhydrous ether through the dropping funnel. Continue the stirring until all 
or most of the lithium disappears (1-1.5 hours) (2). 

Now introduce slowly, and with stirring, 79 g (1 mol) of pure anhydrous 
pyridine (Section 4.1.29, p. 410) (CAUTION) dissolved in 200 ml of anhy- 
drous toluene: remove the ether by distillation, replace the dropping funnel 
by a thermometer and stir the residual suspension at 1 10 °C (internal temper- 
ature) for 8 hours. Then cool to about 40 °C, and add cautiously 75 ml of 
water through the condenser. Filter the liquids if necessary, separate the 
upper toluene layer, dry it by shaking for an hour with 20 g of potassium 
hydroxide pellets and distil slowly through a short fractionating column. 
When the temperature reaches 150 °C at ordinary pressure (thus indicating 
the removal of most of the toluene, etc.), distil the residue under reduced pres- 
sure and collect the liquid passing over at 138-142 °C/12 mmHg. Upon redis- 
tillation 38 g (49%) of pure 2-phenylpyridine, b.p. 140 °C/12 mmHg, is 
obtained. 

Notes. (1) See p-toluic acid, Expt 6.158, Note (1). 

(2) The yield of phenyllithium generally exceeds 95 per cent. One interesting and 
instructive method of determination is to allow the phenyllithium to react with excess 
benzophenone and to weigh the triphenylmethanol formed which is assumed to be 



1170 



SELECTED HETEROCYCLIC COMPOUNDS S.4 



formed quantitatively. A better method is to hydrolyse a 2 ml aliquot portion of the 
filtered solution with distilled water and to titrate the hydrolysate with standard acid, 
using phenolphthalein as indicator. To obtain the filtered solution, the dropping 
funnel is replaced by a short L-shaped tube loosely plugged with glass wool, and the 
solution is decanted through this tube into a graduated flask that has been swept out 
with nitrogen. 

Cognate preparation. Ethyl 2-pyridylacetate. Prepare a solution of phenyl- 
lithium in anhydrous ether as detailed above for 2-phenylpyridine, using 
7.35 g (1.06 mol) of lithium. Introduce 46.5 g (49 ml, 0.5 mol) of dry, redistilled 
2-methylpyridine, with continued stirring dropwise during about 10 minutes. 
Stir the dark red-brown solution of 2-pyridylmethyllithium for a further 30 
minutes, and then pour it slowly (1) and with shaking on to about 400 g of 
solid carbon dioxide contained in a 1.5-litre round-bottomed flask. Break up 
the lumpy residue of lithium salts before adding 375 ml of absolute ethanol. 
Cool the solution in ice, saturate it with dry hydrogen chloride and then in- 
sert a calcium chloride drying tube into the neck of the flask. Allow the mix- 
ture to stand overnight, remove the ethanol under reduced pressure (rotary 
evaporator) on a water bath. Dissolve the syrupy residue in 375 ml of di- 
chloromethane and transfer to a three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical 
stirrer and a reflux condenser. Prepare a paste from 1 12.5 g (0.815 mol) of 
potassium carbonate and 70 ml of water, and add it slowly through the third 
neck to the dichloromethane solution with constant stirring. Stir the almost 
boiling solution vigorously for 1 hour. Decant the dichloromethane solution 
from the inorganic salts, remove the solvent by distillation from a water bath 
(rotary evaporator) and distil the residue under diminished pressure from a 
flask with a short fractionating column. 2-methylpyridine (c. 20 g) passes over 
first, followed by ethyl 2-pyridylacetate as a pale yellow liquid at 135-137 °C/ 
28mmHg, or 110-1 12 °C/6mmHg. The yield is 30 g (36%). 

Note. (1) It is advisable to filter the 2-pyridylmethyllithium solution rapidly through 
a thin layer of glass wool (to remove any unreacted lithium) before it is added to the 
solid carbon dioxide.

Into a 500-ml three-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel, a sealed stirrer

150 ml of anhydrous xylene. Introduce 37.5 g (40 ml, 0.4 mol) of 2-methylpyri- 
dine through the dropping funnel and rinse the latter with a few ml of dry

for 2-3 hours. When cold, destroy the excess of sodamide by the cautious 
addition of 100 ml of water. Transfer the contents of the flask to a separatory

distil again and collect about 700 ml of distillate. Separate the upper layer in 
the steam distillate, extract the aqueous layer with ether and dry the com- 
bined upper layer and ether extract with anhydrous potassium carbonate. 
After removing the ether, distil through a Fenske-type column (15 cm dia- 
meter and packed with glass helices for a length of 12-15 cm) at a pressure of 
50mmHg (manostat, see Section 2.30) and collect the 2-pentylpyridine (42 g, 
70%) at 122.5-124.5 °C/50mmHg. Upon redistillation, the product boils 
almost entirely at 105°C/17mmHg. 

Cognate preparations. 4-Pentylpyridine. Charge a 1 -litre three- necked flask 
(equipped with a sealed stirrer unit, a dropping funnel and a short air con- 
denser) with 600 ml of liquid ammonia (Section 2.17.7, p. 116). Stir vigor- 
ously, add 0.5 g of powdered iron(m) nitrate followed, after 1 minute, by 
11.9g (0.52 mol) of clean sodium in small pieces through the short air con- 
denser over a period of half an hour; continue the stirring until the initial blue 
colour is replaced by a colourless or pale grey suspension of sodamide (see 
p. 462). Introduce 42.0 g (44.0 ml, 0.45 mol) of pure 4-methylpyridine through 
the air condenser; a green colour develops immediately. Stir for 15-20 
minutes and add 46.3 g (52.6 ml, 0.5 mol) of butyl chloride (or an equivalent 
amount of butyl bromide) from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the 
reaction does not become unduly vigorous (c. 10 minutes): upon completion 
of the addition the green colour will have been discharged. Stir for a further 
10-15 minutes, pour the reaction mixture into a 2-litre beaker: allow the 
liquid ammonia to evaporate overnight. Rinse the reaction flask with 100 ml 
of water and add the rinsings to the residue in the beaker; two layers form. 
Separate them and keep the upper layer of 4-pentylpyridine: extract the lower 
layer with a little xylene and wash the xylene extract with 25 ml of 1:1 hydro- 
chloric acid. Dissolve the 4-pentylpyridine in 1:1 hydrochloric acid, combine 
it with the acid washings of the xylene extract and steam distil to remove 
traces of xylene; cool, add solid sodium hydroxide until strongly alkaline and 
steam distil again. Isolate the 4-pentylpyridine as described above for the 2- 
pentyl compound. The yield of the pure base, b.p. 95 °C/6 mmHg, is 46 g 
(69%). 

3,Pentylpyridine. Proceed exactly as described for 4-pentylpyridine using 
11.9g (0.52 mol) of sodium, 42 g (0.45 mol) of 3-methylpyridine and 46.3 g 
(0.5 mol) of butyl chloride. The yield of pure 3-pentylpyridine, b.p. 100.5 °C/ 
9 mmHg, is 46 g (69%). 

8.4.2 PYRONES AND PYRIDONES 

In this section the synthesis of coumalic acid (92), representing the &lt;x(2)-pyrone 
system, is described. a-Pyrones readily undergo a simple lactone-amide trans- 
formation, and the conversion of coumalic acid into the tautomeric 6-hydroxy- 
nicotinic acid (93) provides a further illustration of the conversion of a 
six-membered oxygen heterocycle into the corresponding nitrogen system.

In the synthesis (Expt 8.34), formylacetic acid is formed in situ by the action of a 
concentrated sulphuric acid-fuming sulphuric acid mixture on malic acid 
(H0 2 C-CHOH-CH 2 -C0 2 H). This a-hydroxydicarboxylic acid undergoes 
decarbonylation and dehydration under these conditions before the acid- 
catalysed self-condensation of formylacetic acid. The cyclisation step is generally 
applicable to /Mceto esters. 

Conversion of the derived methyl coumalate into methyl 6-hydroxy- 
nicotinate (Expt 8.35) is effected by the action of concentrated aqueous ammo- 
nia; subsequent hydrolysis with aqueous alkali yields 6-hydroxynicotinic acid.

Methyl coumalate. Place 100 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid in a 250-ml 
round-bottomed flask and add with swirling 35 g (0.224 mol) of finely 
powdered coumalic acid (Expt 8.34). The solution acquires a deep red-brown 
colour and the temperature tends to rise but should be kept below 30 °C by 
cooling in an ice-water bath. Add 50 ml of methanol with continued swirling 
in small portions so that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise 
above 35 °C. Heat the reaction mixture on a boiling water bath for 1.5 hours. 
Cool the mixture and pour slowly into 500 ml of an ice-water slurry with stir- 
ring. Add about 1 50 g of sodium carbonate as a slurry in water until the mix- 
ture is just neutral. If too much carbonate has been added the supernatant 
liquid will acquire a red colour; in these circumstances add a few drops of sul- 
phuric acid. The final solution containing a suspension of methyl coumalate 
and inorganic salts should be an orange colour. Filter the solution, and slurry 
the residue with four 70 ml portions of cold water containing a drop of con- 
centrated sulphuric acid. Filter off the methyl coumalate; the yield after air 
drying is 18 g (47%). Although the product may be used for the next stage, a 
sample may be purified by vacuum sublimation; pure methyl coumalate has 
m.p. 74 °C. 

6-Hydroxynicotinic acid. Place a mixture of 20 ml of ammonia solution 
(d 0.880) and 30 ml of water in a 250-ml beaker sited in an ice-water cooling 
bath on a magnetic stirrer unit. Insert a magnetic follower and add portion- 
wise 18 g (0.105 mol) of methyl coumalate over a period of about 5 minutes, 
ensuring that the temperature is kept below 20 °C. Stir the resulting dark red 
solution for a further 45 minutes at 20 °C and then add it to boiling aqueous 
sodium hydroxide prepared from 40 g of sodium hydroxide and 250 ml of 
water. Boil the reaction mixture for 5 minutes, cool to 10 °C in an ice-water 
cooling bath and add concentrated hydrochloric acid with stirring to pre- 
cipitate the product; the temperature of the solution during neutralisation 
should not rise above 30 °C. Allow the acidified solution to stand in the ice- 
water bath for 1 hour and then collect the bright yellow crystalline solid by 
filtration. Wash the crystals with water and then air dry. The yield of 6- 
hydroxynicotinic acid, m.p. 299-300 °C (decomp.), is 8.5 g (58%).

the crystalline state it exists as the triketo-form (95). In aqueous solution the

with urea in the presence of sodium ethoxide. Barbituric acid undergoes nitra- 
tion in the 5-position on treatment with fuming nitric acid, and reduction of the 
nitro derivative (98) yields 5-aminobarbituric acid (99) (uramil).

ive ethylation and phenylation procedures [cf. Section 5.11.6, p. 680] since for 
the latter reaction the aryl halide is not sufficiently reactive. The procedure de- 
scribed below (formulated in Expt 8.37) provides a suitable indirect alternative 
route. This involves a mixed Claisen ester condensation (cf. Section 5.14.3, 
p. 738) between ethyl phenylacetate and diethyl oxalate, followed by decarbony- 
lation of the a-keto diester on heating to 175 °C. 

Piperazine-2,5-dione (84) is a cyclic diamide based upon the alternative 1,4- 
diaza heterocyclic system and appropriate disconnection of the N — CO bond 
reveals two molecules of glycine.

The synthesis of (84) is effected by heating glycine in solvent such as ethylene 
glycol (Expt 8.38). Brief treatment with hot concentrated aqueous hydrochloric 
acid cleaves one of the amide linkages with the formation of the dipeptide, 
glycylglycine, which is isolated as the hydrochloride monohydrate and may be 
converted into the ester hydrochloride under Fischer-Speier conditions (Section 
5.12.3, p. 696).

In a 2-litre round-bottomed flask, fitted with a double surface reflux con- 
denser, place 11.5g(0.5mol) of clean sodium. Add 250 ml of absolute ethanol 
in one portion: if the reaction is unduly vigorous, immerse the flask moment- 
arily in ice. When all the sodium has reacted, add 80 g (76 ml, 0.5 mol) of 
diethyl malonate, followed by a solution of 30 g (0.5 mol) of dry urea in 250 ml 
of hot (c. 70 °C) absolute ethanol. Shake the mixture well, fit a calcium chlor- 
ide guard-tube to the top of the condenser and reflux the mixture for 7 hours 
in an oil bath heated to 1 10 °C. A white solid separates. Treat the reaction 
mixture with 450 ml of hot (50 °C) water and then with concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid, with stirring, until the solution is acid (about 45 ml). Filter the 
resulting almost clear solution and leave it in the refrigerator overnight. Filter 
the solid at the pump, wash it with 25 ml of cold water, drain well and then 
dry at 100 °C for 4 hours. The yield of barbituric acid is 50 g (78%). It melts 
with decomposition at 245 °C.

Conversion to aminobarbituric acid (uramil). Nitrobarbituric acid. Place 72 ml 
of fuming nitric acid, d 1.52, in a 1 -litre flask equipped with a mechanical 
stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath. Add 50 g (0.39 mol) of barbituric acid 
with stirring, over a period of 2 hours; keep the temperature below 40 °C 
during the addition. Stir for a further 1 hour, and continue the stirring while 
215 ml of water is added and the solution is cooled to 10 °C. Filter with 
suction through a sintered glass funnel, wash with cold water and dry on a 
clock glass at 60-80 °C. Dissolve the crude nitrobarbituric acid in 450 ml of 
boiling water, filter and allow to stand overnight. Collect the crystals by 
suction filtration, wash well with cold water, and dry at 90-95 °C for 2-3 
hours. The product is the trihydrate, m.p. 181-183 °C (decomp., rapid heat- 
ing), and weighs 70 g. Drying at 1 10-1 15 °C for 2-3 hours gives 47 g (70%) of 
anhydrous nitrobarbituric acid, m.p. 176 °C (decomp.). 

Uramil. In a 3-litre flask place 38 g (0.22 mol) of anhydrous nitrobarbituric 
acid and 300 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid; heat the mixture on a 
boiling water bath. Add 125 g of granulated tin and 200 ml of concentrated 
hydrochloric acid over a period of about 30 minutes: continue the heating 
until the yellow colour, due to the nitro compound, in the liquid is no longer 
visible. Introduce 1500 ml more of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heat 
until all the white solid dissolves; add a little decolourising charcoal, and filter 
the hot mixture through a sintered glass funnel. Keep the filtrate at °C over- 
night, collect the uramil by filtration with suction, wash well with dilute 
hydrochloric acid and finally with water. Concentrate the filtrate under 
reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) to about 500 ml and cool overnight. 
Collect the second crop of uramil, wash it as before and combine it with the 
first product. Dry in a vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulphuric acid. 
The resulting uramil (23 g, 73%) is a fine white powder, it does not melt below 
400 °C, and becomes pink to red on standing, particularly if ammonia is 
present in the air.

Diethyl phenylmalonate. In a thoroughly dried 1 -litre flange flask, equipped

sodium pieces (see Section 4.2.68, p. 462); add 250 ml of super-dry ethanol 



1177 



S.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



(Section 4.1.9, p. 400) and allow the vigorous reaction to proceed, cooling 
only if the reaction appears to be beyond control. When all the sodium has 
reacted, cool the solution to 60 °C, and add 73 g (67 ml, 0.5 mol) of pure, 
freshly distilled diethyl oxalate from the dropping funnel in a rapid stream 
with vigorous stirring. Wash this down with 5 ml of absolute ethanol and add 
immediately 87.5 g (85 ml, 0.535 mol) of pure ethyl phenylacetate (Expt 
5.152). Discontinue stirring and raise the stirrer clear of the reaction mixture. 
Within 4-7 minutes after the ethyl phenylacetate has been added, crystallis- 
ation commences. Allow the nearly solid paste of the sodio derivative to cool 
to room temperature, remove the flange lid and stir manually with 400 ml of 
dry ether. Collect the solid by suction filtration and wash it repeatedly with 
dry ether. Transfer the solid to a beaker and liberate the ethyl phenyloxalo- 
acetate with ice-cold dilute sulphuric acid (14-15 ml of concentrated sul- 
phuric acid in 250 ml of water). Separate the almost colourless oil and extract 
the aqueous layer with three 50 ml portions of ether; dry the combined oil and 
ethereal extracts with magnesium sulphate, remove the ether with a rotary 
evaporator. Equip the flask containing the residue for distillation under 
reduced pressure and heat the flask under a pressure of about 15 mm of 
mercury (water pump) in an oil bath. Raise the temperature of the bath 
gradually to 175 °C and maintain this temperature until the evolution of 
carbon monoxide is complete (fume cupboard); if the pressure rises unduly 
during the heating (owing to a rather rapid evolution of gas), discontinue the 
heating momentarily. When the reaction is complete (5-6 hours), return the 
oil which has passed over to the flask, and distil under reduced pressure. 
Collect the diethyl phenylmalonate at 159-161 °C/10mmHg (or at 165- 
166°C/15mmHg). The yield is 95 g (80.5%). 

Diethyl ethylphenylmalonate. In a dry 500-ml round-bottomed flask, fitted 
with a reflux condenser and guard-tube, prepare a solution of sodium 
ethoxide from 7.23 g (0.315 mol) of clean sodium and 150 ml of super-dry 
ethanol in the usual manner; add 1.5 ml of pure ethyl acetate (dried over 
anhydrous calcium sulphate) to the solution at 60 °C and maintain this tem- 
perature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile equip a 1 -litre three-necked flask with a 
dropping funnel, a sealed mechanical stirrer and a double surface reflux con- 
denser: the apparatus must be perfectly dry and guard-tubes should be inserted 
in the funnel and condenser respectively. Place a mixture of 74 g (0.315 mol) 
of diethyl phenylmalonate and 60 g (0.385 mol) of ethyl iodide in the flask. 
Heat the apparatus in a bath at 80 °C and add the sodium ethoxide solution, 
with stirring, at such a rate that a drop of the reaction mixture when mixed 
with a drop of phenolphthalein indicator is never more than faintly pink (1). 
The addition occupies 2-2.5 hours; continue the stirring for a further 1 hour 
at 80 °C. Allow the flask to cool, and remove the ethanol under reduced pres- 
sure using a rotary evaporator. Add 100 ml of water to the residue in the flask 
and extract the ester with three 100 ml portions of toluene. Dry the combined 
extracts with anhydrous sodium sulphate, distil off the toluene at atmo- 
spheric pressure and the residue under diminished pressure. Collect the 
diethyl ethylphenylmalonate at 159-160 °C/8 mmHg. The yield is 72 g (87%). 

5-ethyl-5-phenylbarbituric acid. In a 250-ml round-bottomed flask, fitted with 
an efficient reflux condenser and guard-tube, prepare a solution of sodium 
methoxide from 4.6 g (0.2 mol) of clean sodium and 50 ml of anhydrous meth-

anol (Section 4A.8, p. 400). Add 15 g (0.25 mol) of urea (previously dried at 
60 °C for 4 hours), and then 26.4 g (0. 1 mol) of diethyl ethylphenylmalonate 
dropwise down the condenser. Reflux the mixture for 6 hours and then 
remove the excess methanol under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator) from 
a water bath held below 60 °C. Transfer the residue to a small beaker cooled 
in a freezing mixture and add 100 ml of ice-water with mechanical stirring: the 
temperature of the reaction mixture must be kept below 5 °C since barbitur- 
ates are decomposed by concentrated alkali into the salt of the corresponding 
malonic acid, sodium carbonate and ammonia. Filter and extract the filtrate 
with two 50 ml portions of toluene in order to remove esters; acidify the 
aqueous solution cautiously to Congo red, allow to stand for a few hours and 
filter off the crude phenobarbitone at the pump. The yield after drying at 90- 
100 °C is 13 g (56%). Recrystallisation from hot water yields reasonably pure 
ethylphenyl barbituric acid, m.p. 171 °C. A somewhat higher m.p. (175— 
176 °C) is obtained if rectified spirit is employed for recrystallisation, but the 
recovery is considerably less. 

Note. (1) The rate of addition should be controlled so that the reaction mixture does 
not become strongly basic.

Place lOOg (1.33 mol) of glycine and 500ml of ethylene glycol in a 1-litre

mixture in the fume cupboard to 175 °C and maintain the temperature at this 
level with continuous stirring for 1 hour. Cool the dark brown reaction prod- 
uct to room temperature and leave overnight in the refrigerator. Centrifuge 
the resulting suspension (1) and decant the mother-liquor. Transfer the solid 
to a Buchner funnel with the aid of cold methanol and wash on the filter with 
gentle suction with more methanol, using about 200 ml in all. Crystallise the 
product from 300 ml of boiling water but do not attempt to filter the hot solu- 
tion at this stage; collect the light brown crystals which separate on cooling in 
ice. Dissolve the crude material in 350 ml of hot water, add 4g of decolouris- 
ing carbon and boil for 3 minutes. Filter the hot suspension through a pre- 
heated Buchner funnel (2) and cool the filtrate in ice. Collect the colourless 
crystals of pure piperazine-2,5-dione, wash with a little ice-cold water and dry 
in the oven at 50 °C; the yield is 34 g (45%). The m.p. is rather indefinite and 
depends on the rate of heating; when introduced into a rapidly heated (10 °C/ 
minute) melting point apparatus at 280 °C, piperazine-2,5-dione has m.p. 
310-312 °C(decomp.). 

Boil a few mgeach of the product and of ninhydrin (Expt 5.99) in 0.5 ml of 
water; the absence of a blue-purple coloration shows that the product is free 
from contaminating peptide material.

lated by decanting the suspension through a pad of glass wool in an ordinary filter 
funnel and allowing the crystals to drain as much as possible. In this case the metha- 
nol washing procedure is best omitted, and the product together with the glass wool 
subjected directly to the preliminary crystallisation from hot water described in the 
text. 

(2) If the filtrate from this treatment with decolourising carbon is not colourless it

Conversion into glycylglycine ethyl ester hydrochloride. Heat 150 ml of con-

(0.25 mol) of piperazine-2,5-dione and boil for exactly 90 seconds. Cool the 
resulting solution immediately with swirling in an ice-salt bath, and scratch 
the sides of the vessel to induce crystallisation. Leave at °C for 1 hour, filter 
off the resulting glycylglycine hydrochloride monohydrate with suction using 
an acid-resistant paper (e.g. Whatman No. 50-54) and wash it with three 
15 ml portions of cold ethanol. Suspend the entire product in 600 ml of abso- 
lute ethanol in a 3-litre three-necked flask fitted with a sealed stirrer unit, a 
gas inlet tube and a reflux condenser leading to a gas absorption trap (Fig. 
2.61(c). Surround the flask with an ice bath, start the stirrer and pass into the 
suspension a steady stream of dry hydrogen chloride (Section 4.2.38, p. 438) 
until about 60 g have been absorbed. Replace the cooling bath with a heating 
mantle and boil the mixture under reflux for 10 minutes. Cool the flask in an 
ice bath while still stirring and keep at °C for 1 hour. Collect the crystals by 
filtration and wash them with 12 ml of cold ethanol. Recrystallise the product 
from about 290 ml of absolute ethanol, filter, wash the crystals with a little 
cold ethanol and dry in the air. The yield of glycylglycine ethyl ester hydro- 
chloride, m.p. 183 °C, is 30g (61%). 

8.4.4 QUINOLINES. ISOQUINOLINES AND QUINOXALINES 

The examples selected to illustrate some of the important cyclisation reactions 
leading to substituted quinolines and isoquinolines are quinoline [(100), X = H], 
8-nitroquinoline [(100), X = N0 2 ], 8-hydroxyquinoline [(100), X = OH], 
2-methylquinoline (101), 2,4,6-trimethylquinoline (102), 2-phenylquinoline-4- 
carboxylic acid (103) and 6-methylisoquinoline (104).

The quinoline derivatives (100) to (103) exemplify two important overall strat- 
egies by which the heterocyclic ring may be constructed, indicated by (105) and 
(106). The isoquinoline derivative (104) has been selected to illustrate the overall 
strategy shown in (107). It should be pointed out however that a range of other 
strategies have been employed for the synthesis of quinolines and isoquinolines 
and the reader's attention is directed to specialist texts. 27 





N C 



(105) (106) 




With quinoline [(100), X = H] the first retrosynthetic transform is reduction 
to 1,2-dihydroquinoline (cf. pyridines above) to facilitate recognition of the de- 
rived synthons obtained in the subsequent disconnection. 




FGl 




The Skraup synthesis, the above analysis reveals, is an important method for 
quinoline and many of its derivatives (e.g. 8-nitro- and 8-hydroxyquinoline). 
The reaction involves heating a mixture of an aromatic amine, glycerol, concen- 
trated sulphuric acid and a suitable oxidising reagent. The original Skraup pro- 
cedure employed nitrobenzene as the oxidant, in which case the reaction is 
frequently very vigorous and requires moderation by the addition of iron(n) sul- 
phate. Other oxidising agents which may be used include, for example, iodine 
and arsenic pentoxide. The overall sequence for [(100), X = H] involves first the 
conversion of glycerol into acrolein by the action of sulphuric acid, then the con- 
jugate 1,4-addition of aniline to acrolein to yield 3-phenylaminopropanal [(108), 
X = H], followed by an acid-catalysed cyclisation and dehydration to form the 
1,2-dihydroquinoline, which is finally oxidised to quinoline. 

The preparation of quinoline itself (Expt 8.39) proceeds smoothly without 
becoming excessively violent when iodine is employed as the oxidising agent. In 
the preparation of 8-nitroquinoline (from o-nitroaniline, Expt 8.39, cognate pre- 
paration), the oxidant is arsenic pentoxide. In the case of 8-hydroxyquinoline 
(oxine; Expt 8.39, cognate preparation), a pre-mix of o-aminophenol, glycerol 
and sulphuric acid held at 80 °C is added portionwise to a mixture of o-nitrophe- 
nol and iron(n) sulphate maintained at 100-120 °C; this procedure serves to con- 
trol the vigour of the reaction. Oxine is a useful reagent in qualitative and 
quantitative analysis since it forms water-insoluble complexes with such metals 
as aluminium, magnesium, bismuth, zinc, etc. 

A final point to note with the Skraup reaction is that although ortho- and 
para-substituted amines lead to 8-substituted or 6-substituted quinolines re- 
spectively, mefa-substituted amines give a mixture of regioisomers, namely the 5- 
and 7-substituted quinolines. 

1181 



8.4 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



In a reaction which is mechanistically related to the Skraup reaction an &lt;x,/?- 
unsaturated carbonyl compound, generated by way of an acid-catalysed aldol 
condensation, reacts with a primary aromatic amine in the presence of acid to 
yield a quinoline derivative (Doebner-Miller reaction). For example, when 
aniline is heated with paraldehyde (which depolymerises to acetaldehyde during 
the reaction) in the presence of hydrochloric acid the final product is 2-methyl- 
quinoline (101) (quinaldine, Expt 8.40). Retrosynthetic analysis for the 1,2- 
dihydroquinoline reveals crotonaldedhyde as the unsaturated carbonyl com- 
ponent which is in turn formed from acetaldehyde (see Section 5.18.2, p. 799). 

O 





NH 2 Me 



=&gt; PhNH 2 + 2Me-CHO 



In this case the final dehydrogenation of 1,2-dihydroquinaldine to quinaldine is 
effected by anils formed by the condensation of aniline with either acetaldehyde 
or crotonaldehyde during the course of the reaction. This yields secondary 
amines as by-products; these together with excess aniline are separated from the 
quinaldine by acetylation of the reaction mixture. The acetylated primary and 
secondary amines thus formed are less steam volatile than quinaldine which 
forms the basis of the isolation of the latter. 

The starting materials for the synthesis of 2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxylic 
acid (Expt 8.41) may be discovered by a similar retrosynthetic analysis for the 
1,2-dihydro derivative.

This is an example of the Doebner synthesis of quinoline-4-carboxylic acids (cin- 
ch oninic acids), which consists of the condensation of a primary aromatic amine 
with pyruvic acid and an aldehyde. The mechanism is probably similar to the 
synthesis of quinolines discussed above and involves the intermediate formation 
of a dihydroquinoline derivative, which is subsequently dehydrogenated by the 
anils derived from the aromatic amine and the aldehyde. 

A retrosynthetic analysis for 2,4,6-trimethylquinoline (102) reveals p- 
toluidine and pentane-2,4-dione. This is an example of the Combes reaction.

The reaction proceeds by way of the imine (109) which is converted into the 
enamine (1 10) by prototropic rearrangement before being cyclised with concen- 
trated sulphuric acid. 




(109) (110) 

Formation and isolation of the enamine are achieved by heating the amine and 
the diketone in xylene under reflux using a Dean and Stark apparatus until the 
theoretical amount of water has separated, or alternatively at 100 °C in the pres- 
ence of anhydrous calcium sulphate. The latter is the most convenient and is the 
procedure used in Expt 8.42.

The synthesis of isoquinolines by this overall strategy represents the Pomeranz- 
Fritsch reaction. In fact the dimethyl (or diethyl) acetal of the aminoaldehyde is 
used to effect the formation of the aldimine (111) before the cyclisation step. In 
the classical procedure rather vigorous conditions for cyclisation are required. 
The milder, one-pot reaction sequence which is described below, and illustrated 
in Expt 8.43, has considerable advantages. 28 The aldimine (111) is first treated 
with ethyl chloroformate which activates the imine, and then with trimethyl 
phosphite to form the carbamate phosphonate (1 12) by a type of Arbuzov reac- 
tion; subsequent treatment with titanium(iv) chloride in dichloromethane effects 
cyclisation with loss of the carbamate and phosphonate groups and the forma- 
tion of the isoquinoline ring. Although several solvents are used during the 
course of the reaction sequence, the original publication indicates that chloro- 
form may be used throughout without loss of yield.

CAUTION: This preparation should be carried out in a fume cupboard. 

Equip a 250-ml three-necked flask with a double surface condenser, a 
sealed stirrer and a screw-capped adapter carrying a thermometer positioned 
so that subsequently the temperature of the reaction mixture may be noted. 
Place lO.Og (9.8 ml, 0.107 mol) of pure aniline, 15.0 g (0.163 mol) of glycerol 
(1) and 0.5 g of iodine in the flask. Stir the reaction mixture and add down the 
condenser from a dropping funnel 30 g (16.4 ml, 0.306 mol) of concentrated 
sulphuric acid. Reaction soon commences, the temperature rises to 100- 
105 °C. Heat the flask gradually, with stirring, in an air bath or oil bath to 
140 °C; the reaction proceeds with the evolution of sulphur dioxide and 
a little iodine vapour and the liquid refluxes. Continue heating at 170 °C for 
1 hour, allow to cool and then add cautiously with stirring sufficient 5 m 
sodium hydroxide solution (about 85 ml) to render the mixture alkaline. Re- 
arrange the apparatus for steam distillation (Fig. 2.102) and steam distil until 
no more oily drops pass over. The distillate contains quinoline and a little 
aniline. Extract the distillate with three 25 ml portions of ether, combine the 
ethereal extracts and remove the ether on a rotary evaporator. 

To remove the aniline present in the residual crude quinoline, advantage is 
taken of the fact that bis-quinolinium tetrachlorozincate(n) [(C 9 H 8 N)f 
(ZnCl 4 ) 2e ] is almost insoluble in water and crystallises out, while under the 
same experimental conditions, bis-anilinium tetrachlorozincate(n) 
[(C 6 H 5 -NH 3 )f (ZnCl 4 ) 2e ] remains in solution (2). Dissolve the crude 
quinoline in 100ml of dilute hydrochloric acid (1:4 by volume), warm the 
solution to 60 °C and add, with stirring, a solution of 13 g (0.095 mol) of zinc 
chloride in a 22 ml portion of the diluted hydrochloric acid. Cool the well- 
stirred mixture thoroughly in ice-water and, when crystallisation is complete, 
filter the bis-quinolinium tetrachlorozincate(n) with suction, wash with two 
10 ml portions of dilute hydrochloric acid and drain well. Transfer the solid to 
a 250-ml beaker, add a little water and then 10 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution until the initial precipitate of zinc hydroxide dissolves completely. 
Extract the quinoline with three 25 ml portions of ether in a separatory funnel 
and dry the combined ethereal extracts with anhydrous calcium sulphate. 
Remove the ether by flash distillation using a 10-ml flask and finally distil the 
residue from an air bath using an air condenser. Collect the quinoline at 236- 
238 °C as a colourless liquid; the yield is 6.9 g (50%). If distilled under reduced 
pressure quinoline has b.p. 1 18-120 °C/20mmHg.

pared by heating commercial glycerol in a porcelain evaporating dish carefully over a 
wire gauze (preferably in a fume cupboard), stirring it steadily with a thermometer 
until the temperature rises to 180 °C, allowing it to cool to about 100 °C, pouring it 
into a Pyrex beaker and transferring the beaker to a large desiccator containing con- 
centrated sulphuric acid. It must be remembered that glycerol is a very hygroscopic 
substance. 

(2) An alternative method of removing the aniline is to add 8 ml of concentrated sul- 
phuric acid carefully to the steam distillate, cool the solution to 0-5 °C and add a con- 
centrated solution of sodium nitrite until a drop of the reaction mixture colours 
potassium iodide-starch paper a deep blue instantly. As the diazotisation approaches 
completion, the reaction becomes slow; it will therefore be necessary to test for excess 
of nitrous acid after an interval of 5 minutes, stirring all the while. About 3 g of sodium 
nitrite are usually required. The diazotised solution is then heated on a boiling water 
bath for an hour (or until active evolution of nitrogen ceases), treated with a solution 
of 15 g of sodium hydroxide in 50 ml of water, the mixture steam-distilled and the 
quinoline isolated from the distillate by extraction with ether as above. 

Cognate preparations. 8-Nitroquinoline. Place a mixture of 69 g (0.5 mol) of 
o-nitroaniline, 86 g (0.375 mol) of arsenic pentoxide (CAUTION) and 184g 
(2 mol) of anhydrous glycerol in a 500-ml three-necked flask, fitted with a 
sealed stirrer unit, a thermometer and a reflux condenser. Set the stirrer in 
motion, heat to 100 °C (oil bath) and add 220 g (120 ml, 2.24 mol) of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid gradually down the condenser at such a rate that the 
temperature does not rise above 120 °C (about 20 minutes). Insert a calcium 
chloride guard-tube into the top of the condenser, gradually raise the temper- 
ature to 130-135 °C and maintain this temperature for 7-8 hours. Watch the 
reaction during the first hour of heating: should the reaction become very 
vigorous, lower the oil bath momentarily. Allow the contents of the flask to 
cool and pour into 1 500 ml of water contained in a 2-litre beaker. Add 1 5 g of 
decolourising carbon, stir mechanically, heat at 90 °C for 1 hour and filter. 
Neutralise the cold filtrate slowly with aqueous ammonia solution (1 vol con- 
centrated ammonia, dO.88 + 1 vol water), filter off the crude nitro compound 
at the pump and wash with a little water. Recrystallise from hot water or from 
methanol. The yield of 8-nitroquinoline, m.p. 92 °C, is 45 g (52%). 

8-Hydroxyquinoline ('oxine'). Place 170ml (3.18 mol) of concentrated sul- 
phuric acid in a 1 -litre three-necked flask provided with a stirrer, and add 
1 12.5 g (1.03 mol) of o-aminophenol, followed by 287g (3.12mol) of anhyd- 
rous glycerol: maintain the temperature below 80 °C by cooling, if necessary. 
Keep the mixture in a fluid state by placing the flask on a steam bath. 

In a 3-litre three-necked flask, fitted with a thermometer, stirrer and reflux 
condenser, place 72.5 g (0.52 mol) of o-nitrophenol and 10 g of crystallised 
iron(n) sulphate, and heat to 100-120 °C. Add the liquid amine-glycerol- 
sulphuric acid pre-mix in about ten portions over 2 hours: allow the reaction 
to proceed at 135-150 °C before adding the subsequent portions. Reflux the 
mixture for a further 4 hours, during which time the temperature drops to 
about 130°C. Neutralise the cooled reaction mixture with sodium hydroxide 
solution (250 g in 250 ml of water) with rapid stirring and addition of ice so 
that the temperature does not rise above 40 °C. The pH of the resulting solu- 
tion is about 7, and the 8-hydroxyquinoline together with tarry by-products 
precipitates. Filter the precipitate at the pump, dry at 50-60 °C and then distil 
under reduced pressure from a flask through a fractionating side-arm. A little

Place 62 g (61 ml, 0.67 mol) of aniline in a 1 -litre round-bottomed flask fitted

chloric acid slowly, followed by 90 g (2.04 mol) of paraldehyde: swirl the con- 
tents of the flask to ensure thorough mixing. Remove the flask from the ice 
bath and shake it frequently at room temperature during 1-2 hours. Heat 
cautiously to the boiling point: keep an ice-water bath at hand in case the 
reaction should become unduly vigorous and require moderating. Reflux the 
mixture for 3 hours and allow to cool. Render alkaline with about 100 ml of 
12 m sodium hydroxide solution and steam distil the mixture: collect about 
2.4 litres of distillate. Separate the upper oily layer, extract the aqueous phase 
with a little chloroform (or with ether) and combine the extract with the 
crude oil. Dry the combined oil and extract with magnesium sulphate, 
remove the solvent and heat the residue under reflux for 20 minutes with 
20 ml of acetic anhydride. After cooling, render alkaline with sodium carbon- 
ate solution and steam distil; collect about 2.4 litres of distillate. Extract the 
latter with two 50 ml portions of toluene. Distil off the toluene from the com- 
bined toluene extracts and distil the residue with the aid of an air bath. 
Collect the pure quinaldine at 245-248 °C: the yield is 40 g (42%). Alternat- 
ively, distil the quinaldine under reduced pressure; b.p. 1 16-118 °C/12 mmHg. 
Keep the colourless liquid in a well-stoppered bottle since it darkens on ex-

2,4,6-Trimethylquinoline. Add 6 g (0.032 mol) of the above enamine, in por- 
tions, to 25 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid (d 1.84) contained in a 250-ml 
conical flask. Swirl the mixture occasionally to ensure thorough mixing. The 
first portions of the enamine dissolve rather slowly but solution occurs more 
rapidly with the later portions as the temperature of the mixture increases to 
60-70 °C. Heat the reaction mixture on the steam bath for 30 minutes, and 
then cool the brown solution to room temperature and add it slowly to 
250 ml of ice-water in a 1 -litre beaker. Add solid sodium carbonate to the 
solution until it is alkaline. During this addition the quinoline salt tends to 
separate and the whole mixture may solidify; if this happens the mass should 
be broken up and stirred with a stout glass rod or spatula while the sodium 
carbonate is added. The quinoline eventually separates as an oil from the 
alkaline solution. Cool the mixture in an ice-water bath until the quinoline 
solidifies; avoid over-cooling as this will result in the separation of a large

solution until it becomes slightly cloudy. Add a few drops of ethanol to 
remove the cloudiness and allow the solution to cool slowly to room temper- 
ature and finally chill in the refrigerator. 2,4,6-Trimethylquinoline dihydrate 
separates as long glistening white needles, m.p. 63-65 °C. The yield is 5.2 g

The reaction involves a spontaneous cyclisation of o-hydroxycinnamic acid 
obtained by a Perkin reaction using triethylamine as the base catalyst (Expt 
6.138). 

A more general synthesis of coumarins involves the interaction of a phenol 
with a j8-ketoester in the presence of an acid condensing agent (the Pechmann 
reaction). In the case of 4-methylcoumarin (117) appropriate disconnection 
reveals ethyl acetoacetate and phenol.

Concentrated sulphuric acid is generally used as the condensing agent for simple 
monohydric phenols and j8-ketoesters, although phenol itself reacts better in the 
presence of aluminium chloride (Expt 8.45). The mechanism of the reaction is 
thought to involve the initial formation of a /^-hydroxy ester, which then cyclises 
and dehydrates to yield the coumarin.

Polyhydric phenols, particularly when the two hydroxyl groups are meta 
oriented, react with great ease. If sulphuric acid is used as the condensing agent, 
careful temperature control is needed to ensure a good yield (e.g. 4-methyl-7- 
hydroxycoumarin, cognate preparation in Expt 8.45). In these cases the use of 
polyphosphoric acid is recommended and this alternative process is illustrated. 
Good yields are also obtained from polyhydric phenols by condensation in the 
presence of trifluoroacetic acid. 30

the addition of a filter-aid, if necessary) through a Buchner or slit-sieve funnel 
to remove tarry matter and distil under reduced pressure. The nitrobenzene 
passes over first, followed by crude 4-methylcoumarin at 180-195 °C/ 
15mmHg (75 g) as a red-yellow oil which solidifies on cooling. Dissolve the 
crude product in ether, shake the ether solution with small volumes of 5 per 
cent sodium hydroxide solution until the aqueous layer is colourless. Dry, 
evaporate the ether and recrystallise the residue from a 4:1 mixture of light

Note. (1) Add the aluminium chloride in 25 g portions to the 1 litre of dry nitro- 
benzene contained in a 2.5-litre round-bottomed flask; stir after each addition. The 
temperature may rise to about 80 °C during the addition: cool the flask occasionally 
under running water. When all the aluminium chloride has been added, cool the solu- 
tion to room temperature: a little solid may settle to the bottom. 

Cognate preparation. 4-Methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin. Place 1 litre of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid in a 3-litre three-necked flask fitted with a thermometer,

wise and with stirring. Maintain the temperature below 10 °C by means of an 
ice-salt bath during the addition (c. 2 hours). Keep the reaction mixture at 
room temperature for about 18 hours, then pour it with vigorous stirring into 
a mixture of 2 kg of crushed ice and 3 litres of water. Collect the precipitate by 
suction filtration and wash it with three 25 ml portions of cold water. Dis- 
solve the solid in 1500 ml of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, filter and 
add dilute 2 m sulphuric acid (about 550 ml) with vigorous stirring until the 
solution is acid to litmus. Collect the crude 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin by 
filtration at the pump, wash it with four 25 ml portions of cold water and dry 
at 100 °C: the yield is 155 g (97%). Recrystallise from 95 per cent ethanol: the 
pure compound separates in colourless needles, m.p. 185 °C. 

Polyphosphoric acid procedure. Add 160g of polyphosphoric acid (Section 
4.2.58, p. 458) to a solution of 1 1 g (0.1 mol) of resorcinol in 13 g (0.1 mol) of

then pour into ice-water. Collect the pale yellow solid by suction filtration, 
wash with a little cold water and dry at 60 °C. The yield of crude 4-methyl-7- 
hydroxycoumarin, m.p. 178-181 °C, is 17 g (97%). Recrystallisation from 
dilute ethanol yields the pure, colourless compound, m.p. 185 °C.

water bath with intermittent shaking for 1 hour. Pour the reaction mixture 
with stirring on to about 1 kg of crushed ice, and allow the ice to melt. Filter 
off the flavone which has separated, wash it with water until the washings are 
no longer acidic (about 2 litres are required) and dry in an oven at 50 °C. The 
yield of material having m.p. 95-97 °C is 31.5 (95%). Recrystallisation of a 
portion from a large volume of light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) gives pure 
flavone, m.p. 98 °C, as tufts of white needles.

CHAPTER 9 

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF 
ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 



The organic chemist is frequently faced with the problem of characterising and 
ultimately elucidating the structure of unknown organic compounds. The 
worker in the field of natural products, for example, has the prospect of isolating 
such compounds from their sources in a pure state and then of determining their 
structures. On the other hand the synthetic organic chemist encounters new, or 
unexpected, compounds in the course of investigations into the applicability of 
new reagents or techniques or as by-products of established reactions. Not infre- 
quently a literature report of a long-forgotten investigation comes to light, and 
the structure of the compounds is submitted to new scrutiny based upon the 
current understanding of reaction mechanisms. 

In each of these and similar related instances, the elucidation of the structure 
requires the identification of the molecular framework, the nature of the func- 
tional groups which are present and their location within the skeletal structure, 
and finally the establishment of any stereochemical relationships which might 
exist. This challenging exercise is in a sense complementary to the question 
posed in Chapter 1, where the key objective was 'how may this compound be 
efficiently synthesised, given that its structure is XT The key objective in this 
chapter is 'what is the structure of this substance (solid, liquid, oil, syrup or 
gum)?' Just as the former objective is, for the organic chemist, rooted in develop- 
ing experience and understanding of methodology, strategy, and not infre- 
quently impressive flights of intuition, so in the elucidation of structure the 
experienced organic chemist can often take 'short cuts' and does not usually 
need to proceed by a set pattern of procedures. The experience of the chemist 
(based both on intuitive deduction and on hard-won 'know-how') of the inter- 
related aspects of the typical behaviour of organic compounds and their spectro- 
scopic properties is often overlooked when the success of the final structural 
achievement is reported. 

Broadly speaking such a worker is frequently selecting from the topics and 
areas surveyed in this chapter the most appropriate aspects ('tools') to apply to 
the problem in hand. The undergraduate student needs therefore to consider 
carefully the relative ease with which some preliminary information of structure 
may be achieved at the bench, and its interrelationship with that obtained from 
various spectroscopic data, so that in due time a comprehensive appreciation of 
all aspects of the physical and chemical properties of particular compounds may 
be gained. 

It is undeniable that for the student the problem of the elucidation of struc- 
ture has been revolutionised by the progressive adoption, over the last thirty 
years or so, of the wide range of spectroscopic techniques which are now avail- 



1196 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.1 



able; these are discussed in Chapter 3 and have been applied extensively in the 
preparative sections to confirm the structure of the expected products. Never- 
theless, a valuable background to this area is provided by the performance of 
appropriate investigative exercises, involving the study of selected, relatively 
simple 'unknown' compounds to accomplish their classification and character- 
isation, and most systematic courses in chemistry include practical exercises of 
this type. Although structural elucidation projects in the interpretation of spec- 
tra may be conducted as a tutorial exercise, most benefit will be gained when the 
principal spectroscopic features are considered in conjunction with the practical 
results obtained at the bench. 

With this in mind, it is suggested that the preliminary investigations outlined 
in the following Sections 9.1 to 9.3 should be carefully carried out, particularly 
the study of solubility. Accurate classification of a compound as acidic, basic, or 
neutral greatly assists the subsequent search to identify the characteristic func- 
tional group or groups present. This involves a careful consideration of the 
results of selected classifying chemical tests in conjunction with the recognition 
of adsorptions of diagnostic value in the appropriate spectra. Such cross- 
correlation of information may obviate a diversion into a blind 'cul-de-sac' 
owing to inexperience in spectroscopic interpretation, resulting in an invalid 
conclusion. 

Having established the functionality, the spectroscopic information may re- 
veal information of skeletal features, and the compound may then be converted 
into an appropriate solid derivative, which if known, may confirm the identity of 
the compound, or provide further compounds on which reactivity and spectro- 
scopic studies could be relevant. 

Derivative preparation involves the application of a concisely described 
general procedure to a specific compound (possibly at this stage of uncertain 
identity), and its success may well depend upon the use of intuition and initiative 
in the preparative and purification stages. As such it must be regarded as making 
an important contribution to the training of the organic chemist. 



9.1 PHYSICAL CONSTANTS 

The most widely used physical constants in the characterisation of organic com- 
pounds are melting points and boiling points. The technique of the determina- 
tion of melting point is discussed in detail in Section 2.33. In general, a sharp 
melting point (say, within 0.5 °C) is a characteristic property of a pure organic 
compound. The purity should not, however, be assumed but must be established 
by observation of any changes in the melting point (or in the melting range) 
when the compound is subjected to purification by recrystallisation (the tech- 
nique of recrystallisation is discussed fully in Section 2.20). If the melting point is 
unaffected by at least one recrystallisation, then the purity of the substance may 
be regarded as established. In some cases purification may be effected by sub- 
limation at atmospheric pressure or under reduced pressure (see Section 2.21). 
Confirmation of purity may be obtained by t.l.c. analysis (see Section 2.31). 

The various methods for the experimental determination of boiling point of a 
liquid by distillation are discussed in Section 2.24 for sample sizes ranging down 
to about 0.5 ml. If the liquid is shown by distillation to have a wide boiling range 
(10-30 °C), it will be necessary to subject it to fractional distillation, or to one of 

1197 



9.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the preparative chromatographic procedures, in order to obtain a reasonably 
pure sample of the compound; suitable procedures are to be found in Section 
2.26 and 2.31. If at all possible it is desirable to submit a sample of the liquid to 
g.l.c. analysis to establish homogeneity. The boiling point of very small samples 
may be determined by Siwoloboff s method (Section 2.34). 

The determination of refractive index is useful in assisting the characterisation 
of a pure liquid, particularly in the case of compounds which do not possess 
functional groups suitable for conversion into solid derivatives. The refractive 
index is conveniently determined with an Abbe refractometer (Section 2.37). An 
additional characteristic is provided by the density of the liquid, which is deter- 
mined with the aid of a pycnometer. 

9.2 THE STUDY OF SOLUBILITY BEHAVIOUR 

GENERAL DISCUSSION 

When a mixture of a specified amount of a given solute and a specified amount 
of a given solvent forms a homogeneous liquid, the former is said to be soluble in 
the latter. The arbitrary standard employed in this book is 0.10g of solid or 
0.20 ml of liquid to 3.00 ml of solvent. The study of the solubility behaviour of an 
unknown substance in various liquids, viz. water, ether, 5 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution, 5 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, 5 per cent 
hydrochloric acid and cold concentrated sulphuric acid, may provide useful pre- 
liminary information about the nature of the compound. 

The substance should be tested for solubility in the various solvents in the 
order cited above since, for example, when solubility in dilute acid or base is 
being considered, it is important to note whether the unknown is more soluble in 
aqueous acid or base than it is in water: this increased solubility is the positive 
test for a basic or acidic functional group. Acidic compounds are detected by 
their solubility in 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. Strong and weak acids 
are differentiated by the solubility of the former, but not the latter, in the weakly 
basic 5 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. Nitrogenous bases are fre- 
quently detected by their solubility in 5 per cent hydrochloric acid. Many com- 
pounds that are neutral even in concentrated aqueous acidic solutions behave as 
bases in strongly acidic solvents, such as concentrated sulphuric acid; these in- 
clude compounds that are neutral in water and contain oxygen in any form. The 
presence of acidic or basic functional groups in water-soluble compounds is 
detected by testing their aqueous solutions with litmus or other indicator paper. 

The subsequent systematic search for functional groups is based primarily on 
the knowledge as to whether the compound is neutral, acidic or basic in char- 
acter as determined by the application of these preliminary solubility tests. 

Solubility in water. Since water is a polar compound, it is a poor solvent for 
hydrocarbons of all types. Salts are usually extremely polar, and are generally 
water-soluble. Other compounds fall between these two extremes; these include 
alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, acids, ethers, amides, nitriles and amines. 
Acids and amines are generally more soluble than neutral compounds. 

For homologous series of mono-functional alcohols, esters, aldehydes, 
ketones, acids, ethers, amides, nitriles and amines, the upper limit of water solu- 
bility is found at about the member containing four carbon atoms. The solubil- 

1198 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.2 



ity in water is due largely to the polar group, and as the homologous series is 
ascended the hydrocarbon (non-polar) part of the molecule increases while the 
polar function remains substantially unchanged; this accounts for the decrease 
in solubility in polar solvents such as water. This behaviour is an illustration of a 
general rule that increased structural similarity between the solute and the 
solvent results in increased solubility in that solvent. 

It must be emphasised that the particular region (that of the member contain- 
ing four carbon atoms) of water solubility for many homologous series is deter- 
mined by the arbitrary proportions of solute and solvent defined in the previous 
general discussion. The limit would be elsewhere for a different ratio of solute to 
solvent. 

Solubility in ether. Non-polar and slightly polar compounds will, in general, dis- 
solve in ether because they are largely unassociated. Ionic compounds, such as 
salts, are not soluble in ether. The solubility of a polar compound in ether will 
depend upon the influence of the polar group or groups relative to that of the 
non-polar part of the molecule. Usually, compounds that have but one polar 
group per molecule will dissolve in ether unless they are highly associated or of 
extreme polarity (e.g. the sulphonic acids). 

Many organic compounds that are insoluble in water dissolve in ether. If a 
compound is soluble in both ether and water, it probably (i) is non-ionic, (ii) 
contains five or less carbon atoms, (iii) has a functional group that is polar and 
capable of forming hydrogen bonds and (iv) does not contain more than one 
strongly polar group. If a compound dissolves in water but not in ether, it may 
(i) be ionic (a salt) or (ii) contain two or more polar groups but not more than 
four carbon atoms per polar group. There are, of course, exceptions to these 
statements. 

Solubility in dilute hydrochloric acid. Most compounds that are soluble in dilute 
hydrochloric acid contain a basic nitrogen atom (incorporating an unshared 
electron pair) in the molecule. Thus most aliphatic amines (primary, secondary 
and tertiary) form salts (polar, water-soluble compounds) with hydrochloric 
acid. Aryl groups reduce the basicity of the nitrogen atom. Primary aromatic 
amines (e.g. aniline), although more weakly basic than primary aliphatic amines, 
are soluble, but in secondary and tertiary purely aromatic amines (e.g. diphenyl- 
amine, carbazole and triphenylamine) the basic character of the nitrogen atom 
has been diminished to such an extent that they do not form salts with dilute 
hydrochloric acid and consequently do not dissolve. Alkylarylamines (contain- 
ing not more than one aryl group) and alicyclic amines, however, do dissolve. A 
few types of oxygen-containing compounds (such as the pyrones and the antho- 
cyanidin pigments of certain flowers), which form oxonium salts, dissolve in 
dilute hydrochloric acid. Amides which are insoluble in water are generally un- 
affected by 5 per cent hydrochloric acid but may dissolve in higher concentra- 
tions (10-20%) of acid: this emphasises the importance of employing the correct 
strength of acid in the solubility tests. Many disubstituted amides which are of 
sufficiently high molecular weight to be water-insoluble dissolve in 5 per cent 
hydrochloric acid. 

It may be noted that some aromatic amines react with 5 per cent hydro- 
chloric acid to form insoluble hydrochlorides: the latter sometimes dissolve 
upon warming slightly and diluting with water. The appearance of the solid will 
usually show whether the arylamine has undergone a change: the solid should be 

1199 



9.2 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



separated and its melting point compared with that of the original compound. A 
test with ethanolic silver nitrate solution would indicate the formation of a 
hydrochloride. 

Solubility in dilute sodium hydroxide solution and in dilute sodium hydrogen car- 
bonate solution. Carboxylic acids, sulphonic acids, sulphinic acids, phenols, 
thiophenols, thiols, amides, arylsulphonamides, arylsulphonyl derivatives of 
primary amines, oximes, primary and secondary nitro compounds and some 
enols (e.g. of 1,3-diketones or j8-keto esters) dissolve in dilute sodium hydroxide 
solution, i.e. they contain an acidic group of sufficient strength to react with the 
alkali. Carboxylic acids, sulphinic acids and sulphonic acids are soluble in dilute 
solutions of sodium hydrogen carbonate with the evolution of carbon dioxide; 
some phenols substituted with electron-withdrawing groups (for example, picric 
acid, 2,4,6-tribromophenol and 2,4-dinitrophenol) are strongly acidic and also 
dissolve in sodium hydrogen carbonate solution with the evolution of carbon 
dioxide. Primary and secondary nitro compounds, imides, arylsulphonamides 
and oximes are insoluble in sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. Some of the 
sodium salts of highly substituted phenols are insoluble in sodium hydroxide 
solution but may dissolve upon dilution and warming with water. 

Certain substituents (e.g. the amino group) may markedly affect the solubility 
and other properties of a sulphonic acid or a carboxylic acid. Thus such sulpho- 
nic acids as the aminobenzenesulphonic acids and the pyridine- and quinoline- 
sulphonic acids exist in the form of inner salts or dipolar ions that result from 
the interaction of the basic amino group and the acidic sulphonic acid group. 
Sulphanilic acid, for example, is more accurately represented by formula (1) 
than by formula (2): 

p-H 3 N-C 6 H 4 -SOf p-H 2 N-C 6 H 4 -S0 3 H 

(1) (2) 

These aminosulphonic acids posses the high melting points usually associated 
with salts, but are sparingly soluble or insoluble in water. They all dissolve 
readily in dilute alkali but not in dilute acid, i.e. they appear to exhibit the reac- 
tions of the sulphonic acid group but not of the amino group. The aliphatic 
aminocarboxylic acids (3), because of the presence of the strongly basic amino 
group, exist as dipolar ions (4): 

H 2 N-CHR-C0 2 H H 3 N-CHR-COf 

(3) (4) 

they are soluble in water but not in ether, and dissolve in both dilute acid and 
dilute alkali but react slowly or not at all with dilute sodium hydrogen carbon- 
ate solution. The carboxyl derivatives of the arylamines (e.g. p-aminobenzoic 
acid) are also amphoteric, but the diminution of the basic character of the amino 
group because of its attachment to the aryl group prevents the formation of 
inner salts to any degree; they react normally with sodium hydrogen carbonate. 

Solubility in concentrated sulphuric acid. Solubility in cold concentrated sul- 
phuric acid is used to characterise further those compounds which by virtue of 
the results of the previous solubility tests are considered to be neutral. 

The most important group of compounds to exhibit solubility in this reagent 
are those containing oxygen. The initial solubility of these compounds is due to 

1200 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.2 



the basic character of one or more of the oxygen atoms that are present in the 
molecules, and results from oxonium ion formation; dilution of the sulphuric 
acid solution often results in recovery of the compound in an unchanged form. 
More fundamental changes resulting from subsequent transformations of the 
oxonium ion may, however, occur. 

Unsaturated hydrocarbons dissolve through formation of soluble alkyl 
hydrogen sulphates, e.g. 

R'-CH=CH-R 2 -^-&gt; [R'-CH-CH 2 -R 2 ] ^&gt; R 1 -CH(0-SO,H)-CH 2 R- 

Polyalkylated aromatic hydrocarbons and alkyl phenyl ethers undergo 
sulphonation, e.g. 

ArH + 2H 2 S0 4 ► Ar-S0 3 H + HS0 4 e + H 3 O e 

Compounds which dissolve in concentrated sulphuric acid may be further 
classified as those which are soluble in syrupy phosphoric acid and those which 
are insoluble in this solvent: in general dissolution takes place without the pro- 
duction of appreciable heat or colour. Those compounds soluble in phosphoric 
acid include alcohols, esters, aldehydes, methyl ketones and cyclic ketones pro- 
vided that they contain less than nine carbon atoms. The solubility limit is some- 
what lower than this for ethers; thus dipropyl ether dissolves in 85 per cent 
phosphoric acid but dibutyl ether and anisole do not. Ethyl benzoate and 
diethyl malonate are insoluble. 

SUMMARY OF SOLUBILITY BEHAVIOUR 

It is convenient to summarise the solubility characteristics of the commoner 
classes of organic compounds into seven groups as specified in Table 9.1. The 
compounds are grouped according to: (a) their solubility towards the reagents 
specified above, and (b) the elements, other than carbon and hydrogen, that they 
contain (see Section 9.3). 

1. Compounds soluble in both water and ether. This includes the lower members 
of the various homologous series (4—5 atoms in a normal chain) that contain 
oxygen and/or nitrogen in their structures: they are soluble in water because 
of their low carbon content. If the compound is soluble in both water and in 
ether, it would also be soluble in other solvents so that further solubility tests 
are generally unnecessary: the aqueous solution should be tested with indi- 
cator paper. The test with sodium hydrogen carbonate solution should also 
be performed. 

2. Compounds soluble in water but insoluble in ether. These compounds with the 
exception of Salts, are usually also soluble in dilute alkali and acid. The be- 
haviour of salts to alkaline or acidic solvents may be informative. Thus, with 
a salt of a water-soluble base, the characteristic odour of an amine is usually 
apparent when it is treated with dilute alkali: likewise, the salt of a water- 
soluble, weak acid is decomposed by dilute hydrochloric acid or by concen- 
trated sulphuric acid. The water-soluble salt of a water-insoluble acid or base 
will give a precipitate of either the free acid or the base when treated with di- 
lute acid or dilute alkali. The salts of sulphonic acids and of quaternary bases 
are unaffected by dilute sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. 

3. Compounds insoluble in water, but soluble in dilute sodium hydroxide. It 
should be recalled that some of the compounds belonging to this group are

sufficiently strong acids to release carbon dioxide from sodium hydrogen car- 
bonate (e.g. carboxylic acids, sulphonic and sulphinic acids, and certain sub- 
stituted phenols, see above). 

4. Compounds insoluble in water, but soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid. It should 
be remembered that the hydrochlorides of some bases are sparingly soluble in 
cold water and one should therefore not be misled by an apparent insolubility 
of a compound (containing nitrogen) in dilute hydrochloric acid. The suspen- 
sion in dilute hydrochloric acid should always be filtered and the filtrate 
made alkaline. A precipitate will indicate that the compound is indeed a base 
and should be included in this group. 

5. Water-insoluble hydrocarbons and oxygen compounds that do not contain N or 
S and are soluble in cold concentrated sulphuric acid. Any changes - colour, 
excessive charring, evolution of gases or heat, polymerisation and precipi- 
tation of an insoluble compound - attending the dissolution of the substance 
should be carefully noted. 

Alcohols, esters (but not ethyl benzoate, diethyl malonate or diethyl 
oxalate), aldehydes, methyl ketones and cyclic ketones containing less than 
nine carbon atoms as well as ethers containing less than seven carbon atoms 
are also soluble in 85 per cent phosphoric acid. 

6. Compounds, not containing N or S, insoluble in concentrated sulphuric acid. 
This test provides for a differentiation inter alia between alkanes and cyclo- 
alkanes and also simple aromatic hydrocarbons which are insoluble, and un- 
saturated hydrocarbons which are soluble in the reagent. 

7. Compounds that contain N or S which are not in groups 1-4; many of the com- 
pounds in this group are soluble in concentrated sulphuric acid. 

It will be observed that halogen compounds are not listed separately, but 
appear in each of the seven categories in accordance with their solubility be- 
haviour. 

PROCEDURE FOR SOLUBILITY TESTS 

All solubility determinations are carried out at the laboratory temperature in 
small test tubes (e.g. 100 x 12 mm) but of sufficient size to permit vigorous shak- 
ing of the solvent and the solute. 

Amount of material required. It is convenient to employ an arbitrary ratio of 
0.10g of solid or 0.20 ml of liquid for 3.0 ml of solvent. Weigh out 0.10g of the 
finely powdered solid to the nearest 0.01 g: after some experience, subsequent 
tests with the same compound may be estimated by eye. Measure out 0.20 ml of 
the liquid either with a calibrated dropper or a small graduated pipette. Use 
either a calibrated dropper of a graduated pipette to deliver 3.0 ml of solvent. 
Much time will be saved if each of the solvents (water, ether, 5% sodium 
hydroxide, 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate and 5% hydrochloric acid) be con- 
tained in a 30- or 60-ml reagent bottle fitted with a ground-in calibrated 
dropper. 

Solubility in water. Treat a 0.10 g portion of the solid with successive 1.0 ml por- 
tions of water, shaking vigorously after each addition, until 3.0ml have been 
added. If the compound does not dissolve completely in 3.0 ml of water, it may 
be regarded as insoluble in water. When dealing with a liquid, add 0.20 ml of the 
compound to 3.0ml of water and shake. In either case, test the contents of the 
small test-tube with Universal indicator paper: it is best to remove a little of the 

1203 



9.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



solution or supernatant liquid with a dropper. It is usually convenient at this 
stage to test for the presence of water-soluble enolic compounds by observing 
any coloration resulting from the addition of neutral aqueous iron(m) chloride 
solution. 

Solubility in ether. Use 0. 10 g of solid or 0.20 ml of a liquid in a dry test tube and 
proceed exactly as in testing the solubility in water, but do not employ more 
than 3.0 ml of solvent. 

Solubility in 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. Note whether there is any rise 
in temperature. If the compound appears insoluble, remove some of the super- 
natant liquid by means of a dropper to a semimicro test tube (75 x 10 mm), add 
5 per cent hydrochoric acid dropwise until acid and note whether any precipit- 
ate (or turbidity) is formed. The production of the latter will confirm the pres- 
ence of an acidic compound. 

Solubility in 5 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. If the compound is 
soluble in 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, test its solubility in a 5 per cent 
solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate. Observe whether it dissolves and par- 
ticularly whether carbon dioxide is evolved either immediately (carboxylic acids, 
sulphonic acids, negatively substituted phenols) or after a short time (some 
amino acids). 

Solubility in 5 per cent hydrochloric acid. Add the acid to 0.10 g of the solid or 
0.20 ml of the liquid in quantities of 1.0 ml until 3.0 ml have been introduced. 
Some organic bases form hydrochlorides that are soluble in water but are pre- 
cipitated by an excess of acid: if solution occurs at any time, the unknown is 
classified as a basic compound. If the compound appears insoluble, remove 
some of the supernatant liquid by means of a dropper to a semimicro test tube 
(75 x 10 mm), and add 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until basic and ob- 
serve whether any precipitate is produced: the formation of a precipitate will 
confirm that the compound is a base. 

Solubility in concentrated sulphuric acid. Place 3.0 ml of pure concentrated sul- 
phuric acid in a dry test tube and add 0.10 g of a solid or 0.20 ml of a liquid. If the 
compound does not dissolve immediately, agitate for some time but do not heat. 
Observe any change in colour, charring, evolution of gaseous products, poly- 
merisation accompanied by precipitation, etc. 

Solubility in syrupy phosphoric acid. This test should only be applied if the com- 
pound is soluble in concentrated sulphuric acid. Place 3.0 ml of 85 per cent 
orthophosphoric acid in a dry test tube and add 0.10 g of a solid or 0.20 ml of a 
liquid. If the compound does not dissolve immediately, agitate for some time but 
do not boil. 



9.3 DETECTION OF ELEMENTS PRESENT 

The most commonly occurring elements in organic compounds are carbon, 
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur and the halogen elements; less common ele- 
ments are phosphorus, arsenic, antimony, mercury or other metals which may 
be present as salts of organic acids. There is no direct method for the detection of 
oxygen. 

1204 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.3 



There are three straightforward tests which will provide useful information as 
to the general properties of the compound, and the presence of the more import- 
ant of the elements noted above other than carbon, hydrogen and oxygen; these 
tests are: the ignition test; heating with soda-lime; and the sodium fusion test 
(Lassaigne's test). 

IGNITION TEST 

Procedure. Place about 0. 1 g of the compound on a metal spatula. Heat it gently 

at first and finally to dull redness. Observe: 

(a) whether the substance melts, is explosive or is flammable and note the 
nature of the flame; 

(b) whether gases or vapour are evolved, and their odour (CAUTION); 

(c) whether the residue fuses. 

Evidence of the organic nature of the compound, i.e. the presence of carbon 
and hydrogen (1), and the absence of metals, is indicated by burning with a more 
or less smoky flame, and a black residue consisting largely of carbon, which 
'burns off on prolonged heating, leaving no residue. In general, aromatic com- 
pounds characteristically burn with a very smoky flame. 

If an appreciable amount of residue remains, note its colour. Add a few drops 
of water and test the solution (or suspension) with Universal indicator paper. 
Then add a little dilute hydrochloric acid and observe whether effervescence 
occurs and the residue dissolves. Apply a flame test with a platinum wire, which 
may determine the metal present. 

Note. (1) If it is desired to test directly for carbon and hydrogen in a compound, mix 0.1 g 
of the substance with 1-2 g of freshly ignited, fine copper (n) oxide powder in a dry test 
tube, and fit the latter with a bung carrying a tube bent at an angle so that escaping gases 
can be bubbled below the surface of lime water contained in a second test tube. Clamp the 
test tube near the top and heat the mixture gradually. If carbon is present, carbon dioxide 
will be evolved which will produce a turbidity in the lime water. If hydrogen is present, 
small drops of water will collect in the cooler part of the tube. 

HEATING WITH SODA-LIME 

This is often a useful preliminary test. Mix thoroughly about 0.2 g of the sub- 
stance with about 1 g of powdered soda-lime. Place the mixture in a Pyrex test 
tube; close the tube by a bung and delivery tube. Incline the test tube so that any 
liquid formed in the reaction cannot run back on the hot part of the tube. Heat 
the test tube gently at first and then more strongly. Collect any condensate pro- 
duced in a test tube containing 2-3 ml of water. Nitrogenous compounds will 
usually evolve ammonia or vapours alkaline to indicator paper and possessing 
characteristic odours; hydroxybenzoic acids yield phenols; formates and 
acetates yield hydrogen; simple carboxylic acids yield hydrocarbons (methane 
from acetic acid, benzene from benzoic or phthalic acid, etc.); amine salts and 
aromatic amino carboxylic acids yield aromatic amines, etc. 

SODIUM FUSION TEST 

In order to detect nitrogen, sulphur and halogen in organic compounds, it is 
necessary to convert them into ionisable inorganic substances so that ionic tests 
of inorganic analysis may be applied. This may be accomplished by several 
methods, but the best procedure is to fuse the organic compound with metallic 
sodium (Lassaigne's test). In this way sodium cyanide, sodium sulphide and 

1205 



9.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



sodium halides, which are readily identified, are formed respectively if the above 
elements are present. It is essential to use an excess of sodium, otherwise if 
sulphur and nitrogen are both present sodium thiocyanate, NaCNS, may be 
produced; this may give a red coloration with iron(m) ions but will not of course 
respond to tests for cyanide or sulphide ions. With excess of sodium the 
thiocyanate, if formed, will be decomposed thus: 

NaCNS + 2Na &gt;■ NaCN + Na 2 S 

Cyanide ion, and hence nitrogen in the sample, may be detected by the 
Prussian Blue test. The filtered alkaline solution, resulting from the action of 
water upon the sodium fusion, is treated with iron(n) sulphate and thus forms 
sodium hexacyanoferrate(n). Upon boiling the alkaline iron(n) salt solution, 
some iron(m) ions are inevitably produced by the action of air; upon addition of 
dilute sulphuric acid, thus dissolving the iron(n) and (hi) hydroxides, the hexa- 
cyanoferrate(n) reacts with the iron(m) salt producing iron(m) hexacyano- 
ferrate(n), Prussian blue: 

FeS0 4 + 6NaCN ► Na 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] + Na 2 S0 4 

3Na 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] + 2Fe 2 (S0 4 ) 3 ► Fe 4 [Fe(CN) 6 ] 3 + 6Na 2 S0 4 

Hydrochloric acid should not be used for acidifying the alkaline solution since 
the yellow colour, due to the iron(m) chloride formed, causes the Prussian blue 
to appear greenish. For the same reason, iron(m) chloride should not be added - 
as is frequently recommended: a sufficient concentration of iron(m) ions is pro- 
duced by atmospheric oxidation of the hot alkaline solution. An alternative, 
sensitive, test for cyanide ion is the formation of a deep purple coloration when 
the fusion solution is treated with an alkaline p-nitrobenzaldehyde-o- 
dinitrobenzene reagent. 

Sulphur, as sulphide ion, may be detected by precipitation as black lead sul- 
phide with lead acetate solution and acetic acid or by the purple colour pro- 
duced on addition of disodium pentacyanonitrosoferrate(m). Halogens are 
detected as the characteristic silver halides by the addition of dilute nitric acid 
and silver nitrate solution. Cyanide and sulphide ions both interfere with this 
test for halide by forming silver cyanide and silver sulphide precipitates. If nitro- 
gen or sulphur has been detected, therefore, the interfering ions must be removed 
by boiling the acidified fusion solution as detailed later, before the silver nitrate 
solution is added to detect the halogen. 

Procedure for Lassaigne's test. Support a Pyrex test tube (150 x 12 mm) vertic- 
ally in a clamp lined with sheet cork. Place a cube (c. 4 mm = 0.04 g) of freshly 
cut sodium in the tube (for precautions in the use of sodium see Section 4.2.6%, 
p. 462). Have in readiness about 0.05 g of the compound (if a solid) on a micro- 
spatula or tip of a knife blade, or about 3 drops of the compound (if a liquid) in a 
dropping pipette. Heat the tube steadily until sodium vapour, which is dark grey 
in colour, rises 2-3 cm in the test tube and drop the sample, preferably portion- 
wise, directly on to the molten sodium (CAUTION: there may be a slight explo- 
sion). Do not allow the sample to fall on to the side of the tube above the vapour 
layer. Heat the tube to redness for about 2 minutes, and then allow it to cool. 
Add about 3 ml of methanol to decompose any unreacted sodium and then half- 
fill the tube with distilled water. Boil gently for a few minutes to remove the 
methanol and extract inorganic salts from the fusion residue; gently crush the 

1206 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.3 



residue with a glass rod to assist the extraction process. Filter and use the clear, 
colourless filtrate for the various tests detailed below. If the filtrate is dark 
coloured, decomposition was probably incomplete: repeat the entire fusion pro- 
cedure. Keep the test tube for further sodium fusions; it will become discoloured 
and should be cleaned from time to time with a little scouring powder. 

Test for nitrogen. Either of the following methods may be used. 

1. Pour 2-3 ml of the filtered fusion solution into a test tube containing 0.1 -0.2 g 
of powdered iron(n) sulphate crystals. Heat the mixture gently with shaking 
until it boils, then, without cooling, add just sufficient dilute sulphuric acid to 
dissolve the iron hydroxides and give the solution an acid reaction. {The 
addition of 1 ml of 5% potassium fluoride solution is beneficial (possibly 
owing to the formation of potassium hexafluoroferrate(m), K 3 [FeF 6 ]) and 
usually leads to a purer Prussian blue.} A Prussian blue precipitate or colora- 
tion indicates that nitrogen is present. If no blue precipitate appears at once, 
allow to stand for 15 minutes, filter through a small filter and wash the paper 
with water to remove all traces of coloured solution: any Prussian blue 
present will then become perceptible in the cone of the filter paper. If in 
doubt, repeat the sodium fusion, preferably using a mixture of the compound 
with pure sucrose or naphthalene. In the absence of nitrogen, the solution 
should have a pale yellow colour due to iron salts. 

If sulphur is present, a black precipitate of iron(n) sulphide is obtained 
when the iron(n) sulphate crystals dissolve. Boil the mixture for about 30 
seconds, and acidify with dilute sulphuric acid; the iron(n) sulphide dissolves 
and a precipitate of Prussian blue remains if nitrogen is present. 

2. Mix together 5 drops of a 1.5 per cent solution of p-nitrobenzaldehyde in 2- 
methoxyethanol, 5 drops of a 1.7 per cent solution of o-dinitrobenzene in 2- 
methoxyethanol and 2 drops of a 2.0 per cent aqueous solution of sodium 
hydroxide. To this mixture add 1 drop of fusion solution. A deep purple 
coloration is positive for cyanide ions, a yellow or tan colour is negative. 
Neither halide ions nor sulphide ions interfere. 

Test for sulphur. This element may be tested for by either of the following two 
methods. 

1 . Acidify 2 ml of the fusion solution with dilute acetic acid, and add a few drops 
of lead acetate solution. A black precipitate of lead sulphide indicates the 
presence of sulphur. 

2. To 2 ml of the fusion add 2-3 drops of a freshly prepared dilute solution (c 
0.1%) of di-sodium pentacyanonitrosyl ferrate Na 2 [Fe(CN) 5 NO]. (The latter 
may be prepared by adding a minute crystal of the solid to about 2 ml of 
water.) A purple coloration indicates sulphur; the coloration slowly fades on 
standing. 

Test for halogens. Nitrogen and sulphur absent. 1 . Acidify a portion of the fusion 
solution with dilute nitric acid and add an excess of silver nitrate solution. A 
precipitate indicates the presence of a halogen. Decant the mother-liquor and 
treat the precipitate with dilute aqueous ammonia solution. If the precipitate 
is white and readily soluble in the ammonia solution, chlorine is present; if it 
is pale yellow and difficultly soluble, bromine is present; if it is yellow and in- 
soluble, then iodine is indicated. Iodine and bromine may be confirmed by 

1207 



9.3 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



tests (2) or (3); these tests may also be used if it is suspected (e.g. from be- 
haviour in the silver nitrate test) that more than one halogen is present. 
2. Acidify 1-2 ml of the fusion solution with a moderate excess of glacial acetic 
acid and add 1 ml of dichloromethane. Then introduce 20 per cent sodium 
nitrite solution drop by drop with constant shaking. A purple or violet colour 
in the organic layer indicates the presence of iodine. The reaction is: 

2NaI + 2NaN0 2 + 4Me-C0 2 H &gt; I 2 + 2NO + 4Me-C0 2 Na + 2H 2 

This solution may also be employed in the test for bromine. If iodine has been 
found, add further additional quantities of sodium nitrite solution, warm and 
by means of a dropper pipette remove and replace the organic phase with 
fresh portions of dichloromethane; repeat until the organic phase is colour- 
less. Boil the acid solution until no more nitrous fumes are evolved and cool. 
Add a small amount of lead dioxide, place a strip of fluorescein paper (1) 
across the mouth of the tube and warm. If bromine is present, it will colour 
the test paper rose-pink (eosin is formed). If iodine has been found to be ab- 
sent use 1 ml of the fusion solution, acidify strongly with glacial acetic acid, 
add lead dioxide and proceed as above. 

In this test for bromine, lead dioxide in acetic acid solution gives lead 
tetra-acetate which oxidises hydrogen bromide (and also hydrogen iodide), 
but has practically no effect under the above experimental conditions upon 
hydrogen chloride: 

2NaBr + PbQ 2 + 4Me-C0 2 H &gt; 



Br 2 + (Me-C0 2 ) 2 Pb + 2Me-C0 2 Na + 2H 2 

To test for chlorine in the presence of iodine and/or bromine, acidify 1-2 ml 
of the fusion solution with glacial acid, add a slight excess of lead dioxide (say, 
0.5 g) and boil gently until all the iodine and bromine is liberated. Dilute, 
filter off excess lead dioxide and test for chloride ions with dilute nitric acid 
and silver nitrate solution. 
3. Acidify 1-2 ml of the fusion solution with dilute sulphuric acid, cool and add 
1 ml of dichloromethane. Prepare the equivalent of 'chlorine water' by 
acidifying 10 per cent sodium hypochlorite solution with one-fifth of its 
volume of dilute hydrochloric acid. Add this solution dropwise with vigorous 
shaking to the mixture. If iodine is present the organic phase first becomes 
purple in colour. As the addition of chlorine water is continued, the purple 
colour disappears (owing to oxidation of iodine to iodate) and, if bromine is 
present, is replaced by a brown or reddish colour. If bromine is absent, the 
organic layer will be colourless. It is, of course, evident that if the dichloro- 
methane layer remains uncoloured and the results of test (1) were positive, 
the halogen present is chlorine. 

Nitrogen and/or sulphur present. To remove cyanide and sulphide ions, make 
2-3 ml of the fusion solution just acidic with dilute nitric acid, and evaporate to 
half of the original volume in order to expel hydrogen cyanide and/or hydrogen 
sulphide which may be present (CAUTION). Dilute with an equal volume of 
water and proceed as in test (1), (2) and (3) above. 

Alternatively, add 1-2 drops of 5 per cent nickel(n) nitrate solution to 2-3 ml 
of the fusion solution, filter off the nickel(n) cyanide and/or nickel sulphide, 
acidify the filtrate with 2 m nitric acid and test for halides as above. 

1208 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS S.3 



The presence of halogens may be further confirmed by the Beilstein test. This 
test serves to detect the presence of halogen in many organic compounds. In 
consists in heating the substance in contact with pure copper oxide in the 
Bunsen flame: the corresponding copper halide is formed, which, being volatile, 
imparts an intense green or bluish-green colour to the mantle of the flame. 

Push one end of a 20-cm length of stout copper wire into a cork (this will 
serve as a holder); coil the other end by making two or three turns about a thin 
glass rod. Heat the coil in the outer mantle of a Bunsen flame until it ceases to 
impart any colour to the flame. Allow the wire to cool somewhat and, while still 
warm, dip the coil into a small portion of the substance to be tested and heat 
again in the non-luminous flame. If the compound contains a halogen element, a 
green or bluish-green flame will be observed (usually after the initial smoky 
flame has disappeared). Before using the wire for another compound, heat it 
until the material from the previous test has been destroyed and the flame is not 
coloured. 

It has been stated that many halogen-free compounds, e.g. certain derivatives 
of pyridine and quinoline, purines, acid amides and cyano compounds, when 
ignited on copper oxide impart a green colour to the flame, presumably owing to 
the formation of volatile copper cyanide. The test is therefore not always trust- 
worthy. The test is not given by fluorides since copper fluoride is not volatile. 

The detection of the following elements, which occur in organic less fre- 
quently compounds, is included here for the sake of completeness. 

Test for fluorine. Use either of the following tests. 

1. Strongly acidify about 2 ml of the fusion filtrate with glacial acetic acid, and 
boil until the volume is reduced to about one-half. Cool. Place one drop of 
the solution upon zirconium-alizarin red S test paper (2). A yellow colour on 
the red paper indicates the presence of fluoride. Large amounts of sulphates 
and phosphates may interfere with this test. 

2. If nitrogen and/or sulphur is present, acidify 3-4 ml of the fusion solution with 
dilute nitric acid and evaporate to half the original volume in order to expel 
any HCN and/or H 2 S which may be present. If nitrogen and sulphur are 
absent, proceed directly with 2 ml of the sodium fusion filtrate. Render the 
solution just neutral to litmus by the addition of dilute (5 m) aqueous ammo- 
nia solution, then add 5 drops of 5 m acetic acid and 20 mg of lanthanum 
chloranilate (2,5-dichloro-3,6-dihydroxy-p-benzoquinone, lanthanum salt) 
and shake intermittently for 10-15 minutes. Filter. A pink-violet coloration of 
the filtrate is a positive test for fluorine. 

Test for phosphorus. The presence of phosphorus may be indicated by a smell of 
phosphine during the sodium fusion and the immediate production of a jet- 
black colour when a piece of filter paper moistened with silver nitrate solution is 
placed over the mouth of the ignition tube after the sample has been dropped on 
the hot sodium. Treat 1.0 ml of the fusion solution with 3 ml of concentrated 
nitric acid and boil for 1 minute. Cool and add an equal volume of ammonium 
molybdate reagent (3). Warm the mixture to 40-50 °C, and allow to stand. If 
phosphorus is present, a yellow crystalline precipitate of ammonium 12- 
molybdophosphate, (NH 4 )3[PMo 12 04o], will separate. 

It is usually preferable to oxidise the compound directly as follows. Intim- 
ately mix 0.02-0.05 g of the compound with 3 g of sodium peroxide and 2 g of 

1209 



9.« PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



anhydrous sodium carbonate in a nickel crucible. Heat the crucible and its con- 
tents with a small flame, gently at first, afterwards more strongly until the con- 
tents are fused, and continue heating for a further 10 minutes. Allow to stand, 
extract the contents of the crucible with water and filter. Add excess of concen- 
trated nitric acid to the filtrate and test with ammonium molybdate reagents as 
above. A yellow precipitate indicates the presence of phosphorus. It must be 
borne in mind that the above treatment will convert any arsenic present into 
arsenate. 

Notes. (1) Fluorescein test paper is prepared by dipping filter papers into a dilute solu- 
tion of fluorescein in ethanol; it dries rapidly and is then ready for use. The test paper has 
a lemon yellow colour. 

(2) Prepare the zirconium-alizarin red S paper as follows. Soak dry filter paper in a 5 per 
cent solution of zirconium nitrate in 5 per cent hydrochloric acid and, after draining, 
place it in a 2 per cent aqueous solution of sodium alizarin sulphonate (BDH 'Alizarin 
Red S'). The paper is coloured red-violet by the zirconium lake. Wash the paper until the 
wash water is nearly colourless and then dry in the air. 

(3) Ammonium molybdate reagent may be prepared by dissolving 45 g of pure ammo- 
nium molybdate in a mixture of 40 ml of aqueous ammonia (d 0.88) and 60 ml of water 
and then adding 120 g of ammonium nitrate and diluting the solution to 1 litre with 
water. 

9.4 SPECTROSCOPIC INFORMATION 

The techniques for the determination of the spectroscopic features of organic 
compounds, and of their relationship to the presence of skeletal and functional 
group structures are considered in Chapter 3. Chapters 5 and 6 provide spectro- 
scopic summaries of classes of compounds, and more detailed spectroscopic in- 
formation on specific known compounds as examples in which the 
interpretation of spectra may be further explored. 

When considering the use of spectra for the classification of an unknown 
compound with the aim of elucidating its structure, some careful judgement on 
the relative merits of each spectroscopic tool is required. 

In general, the main value of i.r. spectroscopic features is for the detection of 
functional groups, although the information on skeletal structure is clearly of 
importance. To use a very simple illustration, the technique would clearly dis- 
tinguish between functional isomers (e.g. alcohols and ethers), or aromatic and 
aliphatic compounds, but would be inadequate, for example, to distinguish 
between adjacent straight-chain members of a homologous series of four car- 
bons upwards of a particular functional type. 

With n.m.r. spectroscopy ( 13 C and 1 H), the main value lies in the provision of 
information on skeletal structure (e.g. aliphatic straight or branched chain, aro- 
matic, heterocyclic, etc.); confirmatory evidence on the nature of the functional 
group is deduced from a consideration of the chemical shift values, and from the 
definitive information in the case of groups having replaceable hydrogens, or 
groups with highly deshielded protons. 

The m.s. data, particularly now that recent techniques give a 'best-fit' elemen- 
tal composition of molecular ions and fragment ions which facilitates specula- 
tion of fission processes, provides in association with the above techniques, 
further information of structural value. Polyhalogenated compounds are par- 
ticularly easily handled by this technique. 

1210 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.S 



The principal merit of u.v.-visible spectroscopy is in the assessment of the 
degree of conjugation (not readily deduced from the previous methods) in poly- 
enes, polyenynes, and polyenones, and in the recognition of the presence of aro- 
matic structures. 

Chapter 3 includes a recommended sequence for the systematic examination 
of i.r. spectra (p. 271), p.m.r. spectra (p. 359) and m.s. (p. 373). 

9.5 FUNCTIONAL GROUP IDENTIFICATION 

The solubility behaviour of an unknown compound will serve to classify it into 
one of the three main divisions, namely, acidic, basic or neutral. This informa- 
tion, supplemented by elemental analysis if deemed necessary, and as noted 
above cross-correlated with spectroscopic inferences, forms the basis for the sub- 
sequent systematic search to identify definitively the functional group or groups 
present. It cannot be too clearly emphasised that inexperience in spectroscopic 
interpretation can lead to erroneous conclusions of structure. The value of 
chemical tests is that they reduce the chance of this happening, furthermore they 
are frequently easily and quickly performed and provide experience in accurate 
and reliable observation and reporting. 

When an organic compound contains more than one functional group, the 
classification is generally based upon the one which is most easily detected and 
manipulated. Thus benzoic acid, p-chlorobenzoic acid, p-methoxybenzoic acid 
(anisic acid) and p-nitrobenzoic acid will be classified as acids both by the solu- 
bility tests and the class reactions, and the identifiction of, say, the nitrogen- 
containing acid may be completed by the preparation of derivatives of the carb- 
oxyl group without the absolute necessity of applying the class reactions that 
would discover the nitro group; however, if possible, it is always desirable to 
establish the nature of the subsidiary functional group or groups (including the 
presence of unsaturation), the presence of which may become apparent when the 
preliminary identification of the compound has been completed. 

9.5.1 ACIDIC COMPOUNDS 

The principle classes of acidic compounds are listed in Table 9.1 (Column 3). 
The distinction between true acids and the weakly acidic pseudo acids (e.g. 
phenols, enols, nitroalkanes) should be made by observing the nature of the 
reaction with sodium hydrogen carbonate. To ensure that evolution of carbon 
dioxide does not go unnoticed in those cases where reaction appears sluggish, 
add a solution of the compound in methanol carefully to a saturated solution of 
sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, when a vigorous effervescence at the inter- 
face will be observed. 

CARBOXYLIC ACIDS 

The presence of a carboxylic acid group is indicated by strong infrared absorp- 
tion in the region of 1720 cm -1 (C=0 str.) and broad absorption between 
3400 cm " ! and 2500 cm " ' (OH str.); in the nuclear magnetic resonance spec- 
trum the acidic hydrogen (replaceable by D 2 0) will appear at very low field (&lt;5 
10-13). 



1211 



9.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Confirmatory test for carboxylic acids. Ester formation. Warm a small amount 
of the acid with 2 parts of absolute ethanol and 1 part of concentrated sulphuric 
acid for 2 minutes. Cool, and pour cautiously into aqueous sodium carbonate 
solution contained in an evaporating dish, and smell immediately. An acid 
usually yields a sweet, fruity smell of an ester. (Acids of high molecular weight 
often give almost odourless esters, however.) 

For derivative preparations for carboxylic acids see Section 9.6.15, p. 1261. 

CARBOXYLIC ACID HALIDES 

With these compounds the presence of the halogen will have been detected in the 
tests for elements. Most acid halides undergo ready hydrolysis with water to give 
an acidic solution and the halide ion produced may be detected and confirmed 
with silver nitrate solution. The characteristic carbonyl adsorption at about 
1 800 cm ~ ! in the infrared spectrum will be apparent. Acid chlorides may be con- 
verted into esters as a confirmatory test: to 1 ml of absolute ethanol in a dry test 
tube add 1 ml of the acid chloride dropwise (use a dropper pipette; keep the mix- 
ture cool and note whether any hydrogen chloride gas is evolved). Pour into 
2 ml of saturated salt solution and observe the formation of an upper layer of 
ester; note the odour of the ester. Acid chlorides are normally characterised by 
direct conversion into carboxylic acid derivatives (e.g. substituted amides) or 
into the carboxylic acid if the latter is a solid (see Section 9.6.16, p. 1265). 

CARBOXYLIC ACID ANHYDRIDES 

The simpler examples are readily hydrolysed in aqueous solution, and therefore 
react with sodium hydrogen carbonate and also give the ester test; they may be 
confirmed by applying the hydro xamic ester test (Section 9.5.3, p. 1222). Carbo- 
nyl adsorption is apparent in the infrared spectrum at about 1820 cm" ! and at 
about 1760cm" 1 . It should be noted that aromatic anhydrides and higher ali- 
phatic anhydrides are not readily hydrolysed with water and are therefore effect- 
ively neutral (Section 9.5.3, p. 1218). The final characterisation of the acid 
anhydride is achieved by conversion into a crystalline carboxylic acid derivative 
as for acid halides. 

SULPHONIC AND SULPHINIC ACIDS 

These compounds are suggested if sulphur is present. If nitrogen is also present 
the compound may be an aminosulphonic acid. The infrared spectrum will show 
absorption at 3400-3200 cm " l (OH str.) and 11 50 and 1050 cm" l (S=0 str. in 
a sulphonic acid) or at 1090 cm" l (S=0 str. in a sulphinic acid). For derivative 
preparations for sulphonic acids see Section 9.6.26, p. 1284. The presence of an 
aromatic sulphinic acid may be further confirmed by dissolving in cold concen- 
trated sulphuric acid and adding one drop of phenetole or anisole when a blue 
colour is produced (Smiles's test), due to formation of a para-substituted aro- 
matic sulphoxide. The reaction is: 

Ar-S0 2 H + PhOR &gt; Ar-SO-C 6 H 4 OR + H 2 

Aromatic sulphinic acids are oxidised by potassium permanganate to sulphonic 
acids and are reduced by zinc and hydrochloric acid to thiophenols. 

PHENOLS 

These do not usually liberate carbon dioxide from 5 per cent sodium hydrogen

carbonate solution; most are crystalline solids although notable exceptions are 
w-cresol and o-bromophenol. The monohydric phenols generally have charac- 
teristic odours. The solubility in water increases with the number of hydroxyl 
groups in the molecule. The infrared spectrum shows broad strong absorption at 
3400-3200 cm" 1 (OH str.). 

Confirmatory tests for phenols. Iron(III) chloride solution. Dissolve about 0.05 g 
of the compound in 5 ml of water; if the compound is sparingly soluble, prepare 
a hot saturated aqueous solution, filter and use 1 ml of the cold filtrate. Place the 
solution in a test tube and add 1 drop of neutral 1 per cent iron(m) chloride solu- 
tion and observe the colour; add another drop after 2-3 seconds. If a transient or 
permanent coloration (usually purple, blue or green) other than yellow or 
orange is observed, the substance is probably a phenol (or an enol). If no col- 
oration is obtained, repeat the test as above but substitute absolute ethanol or 
methanol for water as solvent. 

Prepare the neutral ferric chloride solution (i.e. free from hydrochloric acid) 
by adding dilute sodium hydroxide solution to the bench reagent until a slight 
precipitate of iron(m) hydroxide is formed. Filter off the precipitate and use the 
clear filtrate for the test. 

Bromine water. Many phenols (with the exception of those with strong reducing 
properties) yield crystalline bromo compounds on the addition of bromine 
water. Dissolve or suspend 0.25 g of the compound in 10 ml of dilute hydro- 
chloric acid or of water, and add bromine water dropwise until decolourisation 
is slow: a white precipitate of the bromophenol may form. 

Phthalein test. Many phenols yield phthaleins, which give characteristic colora- 
tions in alkaline solution, when fused with phthalic anhydride and a little con- 
centrated sulphuric acid. Place in a dry test tube 0.5 g of the compound and an 
equal bulk of pure phthalic anhydride, mix well together and add 1 drop of con- 
centrated sulphuric acid. Stand the tube for 3-4 minutes in a small beaker of 
Silicone oil (or paraffin oil) previously heated to 160 °C. Remove from the bath, 
allow to cool, add 4 ml of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and stir until the 
fused mass has dissolved. Dilute with an equal volume of water, filter and 
examine the colour of the filtrate against a white background: if the solution ex- 
hibits a fluorescence, observe the colour against a black background. 

It must be borne in mind that there are many nitrogen-containing phenols 
and acids; of these the nitro and amino derivatives are the most common. The 
influence of the nitro and other groups in the ortho- and para- positions upon the 
acidity of a phenol has already been noted: such groups tend to produce a 
marked deepening in the colour of alkaline solutions of the phenol. Amino sub- 
stituents in water-insoluble phenols and acids cause these compounds to be 
soluble in both dilute acid and dilute alkali, i.e. to be amphoteric. Frequently it is 
helpful to destroy the basic character of the nitrogen by conversion of the amino 
group into a neutral amide group by acetylation or benzoylation in aqueous 
alkaline solution: the resulting compound is not amphoteric. 

For derivative preparations for phenols see Section 9.6.6, p. 1248. 

ENOLS 

These compounds (e.g. /?-keto esters and 1,3-diketones) usually respond to the 
following tests. 

1213 



S.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Iron(III) chloride. Add a few drops of neutral iron(m) chloride solution to a solu- 
tion of 0.1 g of the compound in water or in methanol. Most enols give a red col- 
oration. 

Copper derivative. Shake 0.2 g of the substance vigorously with a little cold, 
saturated, aqueous copper(n) acetate solution. Many enols give a solid, green or 
blue, copper derivative, which can be crystallised from ethanol and often has a 
definite m.p. (e.g. from ethyl acetoacetate, m.p. 192 °C; from diethyl acetonedi- 
carboxylate, m.p. 142 °C. 

For derivative preparations for enols see Section 9.6.7. 

THIOLS 

These are generally liquids with an unmistakable penetrating, disagreeable and 
characteristic odour, which persists even at extremely low concentrations in air. 
Alkanethiols are partly soluble in concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide 
but their salts are hydrolysed to the free thiols on dilution with water. Thio- 
phenols are soluble in sodium hydroxide solution but like the alkanethiols do 
not evolve carbon dioxide from sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. Treat- 
ment of a dry thiophenol with sodium results in the evolution of hydrogen (cf. 
Alcohols, Section 9.5.3, p. 1223). 

For derivative preparations for thiols see Section 9.6.25, p. 1283. 

NITROGEN-CONTAINING COMPOUNDS 

Those which are soluble in sodium hydroxide include aliphatic primary and 
secondary nitro compounds, oximes, imides and primary sulphonamides. Aliphatic 
primary and secondary nitro compounds dissolve in sodium hydroxide solution 
to give, in general, a yellow solution; on acidification with hydrochloric acid the 
nitro compound is regenerated. The nitro compounds show pronounced 
absorption due to the nitro group in the infrared at about 1530 and 1370 cm" ! 
(N0 2 , asymmetric and symmetric str.). The presence of the nitro group is con- 
firmed by reduction to the corresponding hydroxylamine (see nitro compounds, 
Section 9.5.3, p. 1227), which can be detected by its action upon Tollen's reagent. 
To distinguish between primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic nitro compounds 
(the latter are neutral) the following test should be performed. Dissolve a few 
drops of the nitro compound in concentrated sodium hydroxide solution, and 
add excess of sodium nitrite solution. Upon cautiously acidifying with dilute sul- 
phuric acid, added a drop at a time, the following effects may be observed. 

(a) Primary nitro compound: intense red colour, disappearing upon acidifica- 
tion. The coloration is that of the alkali salt of the nitrolic acid.

R-CH=fN^ &gt; R-CH-NO, t R-C-NO,

(b) Secondary nitro compound: dark blue or dark green colour due to nitro- 
nitroso derivatives. The coloured compound is soluble in chloroform.

(c) Tertiary compound: no coloration.

For further characterisation of oximes, imides and primary sulphonamides 
see p. 1226 under the miscellaneous neutral and acidic compounds containing 
nitrogen. 

9.5.2 BASIC COMPOUNDS 

Organic compounds that dissolve in dilute hydrochloric acid usually contain 
nitrogen: the rarely encountered pyrones and anthocyanidin pigments are 
exceptions. The most important basic nitrogen compounds are the primary, 
secondary and tertiary amines.* The only hydrazines commonly encountered in 
the group are the monoaryl hydrazines, which are recognised by their ability to 
reduce Fehling's solution with the evolution of hydrogen. They are also conveni- 
ently detected by their condensation with benzaldehyde or some other suitable 
carbonyl compound as a reagent. The lower aliphatic amines and diamines are 
soluble in water and possess characteristic ammoniacal odours which dis- 
tinguish them from water-insoluble amines. The reactions to be described below 
apply to both water-soluble and water-insoluble amines. 

PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND TERTIARY AMINES 

Primary amines may be readily distinguished from secondary and tertiary ana- 
logues by the presence of two absorption bands in the infrared spectrum 
between 3320 and 3500 cm -1 (symmetric and antisymmetric NH str.). Second- 
ary amines exhibit a single absorption band at about 3350 cm" 1 (NH str.). In 
both cases deformation modes for the NH bond appear at about 1600 cm -1 . 
There is no satisfactory absorption to allow a definitive characterisation in the 
case of tertiary amines. In the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of primary 
and secondary amines, the nitrogen-bound hydrogens are recognisable by their 
replaceability on the addition of deuterium oxide. 

Chemical classification of the amine function. The classification of primary, 
secondary or tertiary amines should be carried out by means of the reaction with 
nitrous acid. 

Nitrous acid test. Dissolve 0.2 g of the substance in 5 ml of 2 m hydrochloric 
acid: cool in ice and add 2 ml of ice-cold 10 per cent aqueous sodium nitrite solu- 
tion slowly by means of a dropper and with stirring until, after standing for 3-4 
minutes, an immediate positive test for nitrous acid is obtained with starch- 
iodide paper (see Section 6.7). If a clear colution is obtained with a continuous 
evolution of nitrogen gas the substance is a primary aliphatic or aralkyl amine. If 
there is apparently no evolution of nitrogen from the clear solution, add one-half 
of the solution to a cold solution of 0.4 g of 2-naphthol in 4 ml of 5 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution. The formation of a coloured (e.g. orange-red) azo- 
dye indicates the presence of a primary aromatic amine; in which case warm the 
other half of the diazotised solution and note the evolution of nitrogen and the 
strong phenolic aroma which is produced. If a colourless solution is obtained 
which gives an immediate and sustained positive test with starch-iodide paper 
when only a little sodium nitrite solution has been added, the compound is a 
tertiary aliphatic amine. 



* Many amines are regarded as being potentially carcinogenic: those which are on the restricted list 
have been specified in the Tables of Physical Constants. 

1215 



9.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The formation of Af-nitrosamines* which usually separate as orange-yellow 
oils or low melting solids indicates the presence of a secondary amine. Confirm 
the formation of the nitrosamine by the Liebermann nitroso reaction. This con- 
sists in warming the nitrosamine with phenol and concentrated sulphuric acid. 
The sulphuric acid liberates nitrous acid from the nitrosamine, and the nitrous 
acid reacts with the phenol to form p-nitrosophenol, which then combines with 
another molecule of phenol to give red indophenol. In alkaline solution the red 
indophenol yields a blue indophenol anion. 

r 2 N. NO ™°U R 2 NH + HONO ^&gt; HO-/~\-NO ^^&gt; 

red blue 

Extract the oil obtained in the nitrous acid test with about 5 ml of ether and 
wash the extract successively with water, dilute sodium hydroxide and water, 
and evaporate off the ether. Apply Liebermann's nitroso reaction to the residual 
oil or solid. Place 1 drop of 0.01-0.02 g of the nitroso compound in a dry test 
tube, add 0.05 g of phenol and warm together for 20 seconds; cool, and add 1 ml 
of concentrated sulphuric acid. An intense green (or greenish-blue) coloration 
will be developed, which changes to pale red upon pouring into 30-50 ml of cold 
water; the colour becomes deep blue or green upon adding excess of sodium 
hydroxide solution. 

If the unknown base is a tertiary aromatic amine the treatment with nitrous 
acid will yield a dark orange-red solution or an orange crystalline precipitate 
resulting from the formation of the hydrochloride of the C-nitrosamine. Basifi- 
cation of the solution or of the isolated orange precipitate with either sodium 
hydroxide or carbonate solution yields the bright green nitrosamine base. In 
favourable cases this may be isolated by extraction with ether, recrystallised and 
used for characterisation purposes (see p. 1278). 

Confirmatory tests for primary amines. Carbylamine test. To 1 ml of 0.5 M-alco- 
holic potassium hydroxide solution (or to a solution prepared by dissolving a 
fragment of potassium hydroxide half the size of a pea in 1 ml of ethanol) add 
0.05-0.1 g of the amine and 3 drops of chloroform, and heat to boiling. A carby- 
lamine (isocyanide) is formed and will be readily identified by its extremely 
nauseating odour (CAUTION): 

RNH 2 + CHC1 3 + 3KOH y RNC + 3KC1 + 3H 2 

When the reaction is over, add concentrated hydrochloric acid to decompose 
the isocyanide and pour it away after the odour is no longer discernible. The test 
is extremely delicate and will often detect traces of primary amines in secondary 
and tertiary amines; it must therefore be used with due regard to this and other 
factors. 

5-Nitrosalicylaldehyde reagent test. This test is based upon the fact that 5-nitro- 
salicylaldehyde and nickel ions when added to a primary amine produce an 
immediate precipitate of the nickel derivative of the Schiffs base. 

* Potentially carcinogenic, see Section 2.3.4, p. 49. 

1216 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.5 



To 5 ml of water add 1-2 drops of the amine; if the amine does not dissolve, 
add a drop or two of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Add 0.5-1 ml of this amine 
solution to 2-3 ml of the reagent; an almost immediate precipitate indicates the 
presence of a primary amine. A slight turbidity indicates the presence of a prim- 
ary amine as an impurity. (Primary aromatic amines generally require 2-3 
minutes for the test. Urea and other amides, as well as amino acids, do not 
react.) 

The 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde reagent is prepared as follows. Add 0.5 g of 5-nitro- 
salicylaldehyde (m.p. 124-125 °C) to 15 ml of pure triethanolamine and 25 ml of 
water; shake until dissolved. Then introduce 0.5 g of crystallised nickel(n) chlor- 
ide dissolved in a few ml of water, and dilute to 100 ml with water. If the tri- 
ethanolamine contains some ethanolamine (thus causing a precipitate), it may 
be necessary to add a further 0.5 g of the aldehyde and to filter off the resulting 
precipitate. The reagent is stable for long periods. 

Riminfs test (for primary aliphatic amines). To a suspension or solution of 
1 drop of the compound or to an equivalent quantity of its solution in 3 ml of 
water, add 1 ml of pure acetone and 1 drop of a freshly prepared 1 per cent 
aqueous solution of disodium pentacyanonitrosoferrate(m) (nitroprusside). A 
violet-red colour will develop within 1 minute. 

Confirmatory tests for secondary aliphatic amines. Simon's test. To a solution or 
suspension of 1 drop of the compound or to an equivalent quantity of its solu- 
tion in 3 ml of water, add 2 drops of freshly prepared acetaldehyde solution, 
followed by 1 drop of a 1 per cent aqueous solution of disodium 
pentacyanonitrosoferrate(in). A blue coloration is produced within 5 minutes, 
after which the colour gradually changes through greenish-blue to yellow. 

Carbon disulphide reagent test. This test is based upon the formation from a 
secondary amine and carbon disulphide of a dialkyldithiocarbamate; the latter 
readily forms a nickel derivative with a solution of a nickel salt: 

R 2 NH + CS 2 ™L&gt; R 2 N&lt; e S ffi ^&gt; (r 2 N&lt; SN ) Ni 

SNH 4 V S^- 

To 5 ml of water add 1-2 drops of the secondary amine; if it does not dissolve, 
add a drop or two of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Place 1 ml of the reagent in 
a test tube, add 0.5-1 ml of concentrated ammonia solution, followed by 0.5- 
1 ml of the above amine solution. A precipitate indicates a secondary amine. A 
slight turbidity points to the presence of a secondary amine as an impurity. The 
test is very sensitive; it is not given by primary amines. 

The carbon disulphide reagent is prepared by adding to a solution of 0.5 g 
crystallised nickel(n) chloride in 100 ml of water enough carbon disulphide so 
that after shaking a globule of carbon disulphide is left at the bottom of the 
bottle. The reagent is stable for long periods in a well-stoppered bottle. If all the 
carbon disulphide evaporates, more must be added (CAUTION). 

It should be noted that aliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary 
amines may be distinguished from tertiary amines by their reaction with acetyl 
chloride, benzoyl chloride and benzenesulphonyl chloride. In the latter case a 
primary amine yields an alkali-soluble derivative which distinguishes it from a 
secondary amine when the derivative is neutral and insoluble in acid and alkali. 

1217 



9.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The separation of primary, secondary and tertiary amines using toluene-p- 
sulphonyl chloride (Hinsberg's method) is described in Section 9.7. 

For the preparation of derivatives of primary, secondary and tertiary amines 
see Sections 9.6.21, and 9.6.22. 

9.5.3 NEUTRAL COMPOUNDS 

COMPOUNDS CONTAINING CARBON, HYDROGEN AND POSSIBLY OXYGEN 

It is convenient to consider the indifferent or neutral oxygen derivatives of the 
hydrocarbons - (a) aldehydes and ketones, (b) esters and anhydrides, (c) alcohols 
and ethers - together. All of these, with the exception of the water-soluble 
members of low molecular weight, are soluble only in concentrated sulphuric 
acid, as are alkenes and readily sulphonated arenes. The above classes of com- 
pounds must be tested for in the order in which they are listed, otherwise 
erroneous conclusions may be drawn from the reactions for the functional group 
about to be described. 

ALDEHYDES AND KETONES 

These compounds contain the carbonyl group, hence a general test for carbonyl 
compounds will immediately identify both classes of compounds. The preferred 
reagent is 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, which gives sparingly soluble dinitrophe- 
nylhydrazones with carbonyl compounds (including many quinones). Add 2 
drops or 0.05-0. 1 g of the substance to be tested to 3 ml of 2,4-dinitrophenylhyd- 
razine reagent, and shake. If no precipitate forms immediately allow to stand for 
5-10 minutes. A crystalline precipitate indicates the presence of a carbonyl com- 
pound. Occasionally the precipitate is oily at first, but this becomes crystalline 
upon standing. 

2,4-Dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent may be prepared by either of the follow- 
ing methods. 

1. Suspend 2.0 g. of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 100 ml of methanol; add cau- 
tiously and slowly 4.0 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. The mixture 
becomes warm and the solid usually dissolves completely. Filter, if necessary. 

2. Dissolve 0.25 g of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in a mixture of 42 ml of concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid and 50 ml of water by warming on a water bath: 
dilute the cold solution to 250 ml with distilled water. This reagent is more 
suitable for water-soluble aldehydes and ketones since alcohol is absent. 

The above reagent is very dilute and is intended for qualitative reactions. It is 
hardly suitable for the preparation of crystalline derivatives except in very small 
quantities (compare Section 9.6.13, p. 1257). 

The acetals R 1 -CH(OR 2 ) 2 are so readily hydrolysed by acids that they may 
give a positive result in the above test: 

R'-CH(OR 2 ) 2 + H 2 -^-&gt; R'-CHO + 2R 2 OH 

(For a more detailed discussion on Acetals, see Section 9.6.12, p. 1257). 

If the unknown compound gives a positive test with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydra- 
zine it then becomes necessary to decide whether it is an aldehyde or a ketone. 
The infrared spectrum of the compound should be very informative; both alde- 
hydes and ketones show strong absorption at 1740-1700 cm" ! (C=0 str.), but 
only aldehydes exhibit two absorption bands at about 2720 and 2820 cm" 1 

1218 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.5 



(C — H str.). In the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of an aldehyde a low- 
field signal for the aldehydic hydrogen (&lt;5 9-10) is characteristic. 

Chemical differentiation between aldehydes and ketones. SchijQTs reagent. Alde- 
hydes produces a pink colour, while ketones are without effect. Use 2 drops (or 
0.05 g) of the compound and 2 ml of Schiffs reagent and shake the mixture in the 
cold. Some aromatic aldehydes (e.g. vanillin) give a negative result. 
The reagent may be prepared by either of the following methods. 

1. Dissolve 0.2 g of pure p-rosaniline hydrochloride in 20 ml of a cold, freshly 
prepared, saturated aqueous solution of sulphur dioxide; allow the solution 
to stand for a few hours until it becomes colourless or pale yellow. Dilute the 
solution of 200 ml and keep it in a tightly stoppered bottle. If the bottle is not 
adequately stoppered, the reagent will gradually lose sulphur dioxide and the 
colour will return. The solution keeps well if not unnecessarily exposed to 
light and air. 

2. Add 2 g of sodium metabisulphite to a solution of 0.2 g of p-rosaniline hydro- 
chloride and 2 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 ml of water. 

By way of caution it should be noted that free alkali or the alkali salts of weak 
acids will redden the reagent like an aldehyde. It is also, of course, reddened by 
heat or when exposed in small quantities to the air for some time. Mineral acids 
greatly reduce the sensitivity of the test. 

Ammoniacal silver nitrate solution {Tollen's solution). Aldehydes alone reduce 
Tollen's reagent and produce a silver mirror on the inside of the test tube. Add 
2-3 drops (or 0.05 g) of the compound to 2-3 ml of Tollen's solution contained 
in a clean test tube (the latter is preferably cleaned with hot nitric acid). If no 
reaction appears to take place in the cold, warm in a beaker of hot water. 
(CAUTION: After the test, pour the contents of the test tube into the sink and 
wash the test tube with dilute nitric acid. Any silver fulminate present, which is 
highly explosive when dry, will thus be destroyed) 

Tollen's reagent is prepared as follows: Dissolve 3 g of silver nitrate in 30 ml of 
water (solution A) and 3g of sodium hydroxide in 30 ml of water (solution B). 
When the reagent is required, mix equal volumes (say, 1 ml) of solutions A and B 
in a clean test tube, and add dilute ammonia solution drop by drop until the 
silver oxide is just dissolved. Great care must be taken in the preparation and 
use of this reagent, which must not be heated. Only a small volume should be 
prepared just before use, any residue washed down the sink with a large quantity 
of water, and the test tubes rinsed with dilute nitric acid. 

Fehling's solution. Aldehydes alone reduce Fehling's solution to yellow or red 
copper(i) oxide. Use 2 drops (or 0.05 g) of the compound and 2-3 ml of Fehling's 
solution: heat on a boiling water bath for 3-4 minutes. This test is positive for 
aliphatic aldehydes, but is often indecisive for aromatic aldehydes. 

Preparation of Fehling's solution. Solution No. 1. Dissolve 34.64 g of 
copper(n) sulphate crystals in water containing a few drops of dilute sulphuric 
acid, and dilute the solution to 500 ml. 

Solution No. 2. Dissolve 60 g of pure sodium hydroxide and 173g of pure 
Rochelle salt (sodium potassium tartrate) in water, filter if necessary through a 
sintered glass funnel and make up the filtrate and washings to 500 ml. 

Keep the two solutions separately in tightly stoppered bottles and mix 
exactly equal volumes immediately before use. 

1219 



9.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Further classification tests for aldehydes and ketones Sodium metabisulphite test. 

Aldehydes and simple ketones react with a saturated solution of sodium meta- 
bisulphite to yield crystalline bisulphite-addition compounds: 

R^CO + NaHSOs ;==± R'T^QOHOSOsNa 

A condition of equilibrium is reached (70-90 per cent of bisulphite compound 
with equivalent quantities of the reagents in 1 hour), but by using a large excess 
of bisulphite almost complete conversion into the addition compound results. 
Since the reaction is reversible, the carbonyl compound can be recovered by 
adding to an aqueous solution of the bisulphite compound sufficient sodium 
carbonate solution or hydrochloric acid to react with the free sodium meta- 
bisulphite present in the equilibrium mixture. Bisulphite compounds may there- 
fore be employed for the purification of carbonyl compounds or for their 
separation from other organic substances. 

The most satisfactory reagent is a saturated solution of sodium meta- 
bisulphite containing ethanol; it must be prepared as required since it oxdises 
and decomposes on keeping. Frequently, a saturated aqueous solution is used 
without the addition of ethanol. 

Prepare 10 ml of saturated sodium metabisulphite solution and add 4 ml of 
the carbonyl compound; shake thoroughly and observe the rise in temperature. 
Filter the crystalline precipitate at the pump, wash it with a little alcohol, fol- 
lowed by ether and allow it to dry. The sodium metabisulphite reagent is prepared 
by treating a saturated aqueous solution of sodium metabisulphite with 70 per 
cent of its volume of industrial spirit, and then adding just sufficient water to 
produce a clear solution. 

Iodoform test. Methyl ketones and acetaldehyde, i.e. compounds containing the 
Me-CO — grouping, give a positive iodoform reaction. Alcohols having the 
structure Me-CH(OH)-R, which undergo oxidation to the corresponding 
methyl ketone, also slowly give a positive test. Dissolve 0.1 g or 4-5 drops of the 
compound in 2 ml of water; if it is insoluble in water, add sufficient dioxane to 
produce a homogeneous solution. Add 2 ml of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution and then introduce a potassium iodide-iodine reagent dropwise with 
shaking until a definite dark colour of iodine persists. Allow to stand for 2-3 
minutes; if no iodoform separates at room temperature, warm the test tube in a 
beaker of water at 60 °C. Add more drops of the iodine reagent if the faint iodine 
colour disappears: continue the addition of the reagent until the dark colour is 
not discharged after 2 minutes heating at 60 °C. Remove the excess of iodine by 
the addition of a few drops of dilute sodium hydroxide solution with shaking, 
dilute with an equal volume of water and allow to stand for 10-15 minutes. The 
test is positive if a yellow precipitate of iodoform is deposited. Filter off the 
yellow precipitate, dry upon pads of filter paper and determine the m.p.: 
iodoform melts at 120 °C. 

The potassium iodide-iodine reagent is prepared by dissolving 20 g of potas- 
sium iodide and 10 g of iodine in 100 ml of water. 

For the preparation of derivatives of aldehydes and ketones see Section 
9.6.13, p. 1257. 

QUINONES 

The following tests will be found useful for the detection of simple quinones. 

1220 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.5 



Quinones are coloured (generally yellow) crystalline solids; they are usually in- 
soluble in water, soluble in ether and sublime on heating. Frequently the vapour 
has a penetrating odour and attacks the eyes. The carbonyl groups of quinones 
often do not react in a normal way with carbonyl group reagents, because of 
their oxidising properties: thus quinones are reduced by sodium metabisulphite. 
Crystalline products are usually formed with one molecule of phenylhydrazine 
or with one molecule of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, but these are not always of 
normal structure. Thus p-benzoquinone reacts with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine 
hydrochloride in hot alcoholic solution to give 2',4'-dinitrophenyl-4-azophenol, 
m.p. 185-186 °C. 

(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H,-NH-NH 2 + 0=/ Vo ^^&gt; (N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -N=N-C 6 H 4 OH 

Tests for quinones Hydriodic acid. Compounds of the p-benzoquinone type 
liberate iodine from hydriodic acid. Dissolve 0.1 g. of the quinone in a little recti- 
fied spirit. Add 10 ml of 10 per cent aqueous potassium iodide solution to a mix- 
ture of 5 ml of ethanol and 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then 
introduce the quinone solution. Iodine is liberated immediately. This test is also 
given by other oxidising agents. 

Reduction with zinc powder and acid. Simple p-quinones are reduced to hydro- 
quinones in the following manner. Dissolve or suspend 0.5 g of the quinone in 
dilute hydrochloric acid (1:5) and add a little zinc powder. When the solution is 
colourless, filter, neutralise with sodium hydrogen carbonate, extract the dihyd- 
ric phenol with ether, remove the solvent and identify (Section 9.6.6, p. 1248). 

Reduction with zinc powder and sodium hydroxide. Compounds of the anthra- 
quinone type are reduced to oxanthrols. Treat 0.1 g of the quinone with dilute 
sodium hydroxide and zinc powder. Upon boiling the mixture a red colour is 
produced: this disappears when the solution is shaken owing to aerial oxidation 
to the original quinone. 

Distillation with zinc powder. Quinones derived from polycyclic hydrocarbons 
may be reduced to the parent hydrocarbon as follows. Grind 0.5 g of the com- 
pound with 3-4 g of zinc powder, pour the mixture into a Pyrex test tube and 
cover it with an equal volume of zinc powder. Clamp the tube horizontally at the 
open end. Heat the zinc powder first, then the mixture of zinc powder and the 
compound to a dull red heat: the hydrocarbon sublimes into the cooler part of 
the tube. Remove the sublimate; determine the m.p. and characterise it by the 
preparation of the picrate (Section 9.6.3, p. 1238). 

Reaction with semicarbazlde hydrochloride. Many simple quinones yield crystal- 
line mono-semicarbazones by the following procedure. Dissolve 0.2 g of semi- 
carbazide hydrochloride in a little water, add 0.2 g of the quinone and warm. 
The mono-semicarbazone is immediately formed as a yellow precipitate. Filter 
and recrystallise from hot water; any bis-semicarbazone will remain undis- 
solved. 

Reaction with o-phenylene diamine. o-Quinones (and also aromatic a-diketones, 
e.g. benzil) react with o-phenylenediamine to yield quinoxalines. Dissolve the 
substance in ethanol or glacial acetic acid, add an equivalent amount of o- 

1221 



3.5 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



phenylenediamine in ethanolic solution and warm for 15 minutes on a water 
bath. Cool, dilute with water, filter and recrystallise from dilute ethanol. 
For the preparation of derivatives of quinones see Section 9.6.14, p. 1261. 

ESTERS AND ACID ANHYDRIDES 

When a compound fails to respond to the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine test for 
aldehydes and ketones, yet exhibits carbonyl absorption in the infrared region, it 
may be either an ester, an acid anhydride or, possibly, a lactone. The infrared 
absorption for esters is in the region of 1 750- 1730 cm " ! (C=0 str.) and in the 
region 1000-1 300 cm" 1 (C — O str.). Anhydrides exhibit two absorption bands 
at about 1820 and 1750 cm" ' (C=0 str.) together with absorption in the range 
of 1100-1200 (C— O str.). Lactones absorb at about 1750 cm" 1 (C=0 str., the 
frequency depends upon the ring size), and in the range 1 000- 1300 cm " ! (C — O 
str.). 

The presence of any of these functional types may be established chemically 
by applying the hydroxamic acid test. These compounds react with hydroxyl- 
amine in the presence of sodium hydroxide to form the sodium salt of the corres- 
ponding hydroxamic acid. On acidification and addition of iron(m) chloride 
solution the magenta coloured iron(m) complex of the hydroxamic acid is 
formed.

The hydroxamic acid test is also given by acid chlorides and some primary 
aliphatic amides which are readily converted by hydroxylamine hydrochloride 
into hydroxamic acids. Some esters, mainly of carbonic, carbamic, sulphuric and 
other inorganic acids, give only a yellow colour. 

It is always advisable to ensure that the sample does not give a colour with 
iron(m) chloride before carrying out the hydroxamic acid test. 

Hydroxamic acid test. A. Dissolve a drop or a few small crystals of the com- 
pound in 1 ml of rectified spirit (95% ethanol) and add 1 ml of m hydrochloric 
acid. Note the colour produced when 1 drop of 5 per cent iron(m) chloride solu- 
tion is added to the solution. If a pronounced violet, blue, red or orange colour is 
produced, the hydroxamic acid test described below is not applicable and 
should not be used. 

B. Mix 1 drop or several small crystals (c. 0.05 g) of the compound with 1 ml 
of 0.5 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 95 per cent ethanol and add 0.2 ml of 
6 m aqueous sodium hydroxide. Heat the mixture to boiling and, after the solu- 
tion has cooled slightly, add 2 ml of m hydrochloric acid. If the solution is 
cloudy, add 2 ml of 95 per cent ethanol. Observe the colour produced when 
1 drop of 5 per cent iron(ra) chloride solution is added. If the resulting colour 
does not persist, continue to add the reagent dropwise until the observed colour 
pervades the entire solution. Usually only 1 drop of the iron(m) chloride solu- 

1222 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.5 



tion is necessary. Compare the colour with that produced in test A. A positive 
test will be a distinct burgundy or magenta colour as compared with the yellow 
colour observed when the original compound is tested with iron(m) chloride 
solution in the presence of acid. It is often advisable to conduct in parallel the 
test with, say, ethyl acetate, to ensure that the conditions for this test are correct. 

Differentiation between esters and anhydrides. The following simple test relies on 
the fact that hydrolysis of acid anhydrides is more rapid than that of esters under 
basic conditions. Add 1 ml of the compound to 2 ml of water to which has been 
added 1 drop of 1 m sodium hydroxide solution and a trace of phenolphthalein 
indicator. Warm the solution gently on a water bath; with anhydrides the pink 
colour is discharged within about 1 minute and the further dropwise addition of 
alkali enables the rate of hydrolysis to be monitored. With most esters hydroly- 
sis is very slow under these conditions. For the preparation of derivatives of 
esters and anhydrides see Sections 9.6.17, p. 1266 and 9.6.16, p. 1265 respectively. 

ALCOHOLS AND ETHERS 

If the unknown, neutral, oxygen-containing compound does not give the class 
reactions for aldehydes, ketones, esters and anhydrides, it is probably either an 
alcohol or an ether. Alcohols are readily identified by the intense characteristic 
hydroxyl adsorption which occurs as a broad band in the infrared spectrum at 
3600-3300 cm" 1 (O — H str.). In the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum, the 
adsorption by the proton in the hydroxyl group gives rise to a broad peak the 
chemical shift of which is rather variable; the peak disappears on deuteration. 
Chemically, alcohols and ethers may be simply distinguished by the use of 
two reagents - metallic sodium and acetyl chloride. 

Reaction with sodium. Metallic sodium reacts with alcohols with the evolution 
of hydrogen. 

2ROH + 2Na ► 2RO e Na e + H 2 

The most common interfering substance, especially with alcohols of low molecu- 
lar weight, is water; this may result in an inaccurate interpretation of the test if 
applied alone. Most of the water may usually be removed by shaking with a little 
anhydrous calcium sulphate. Dry ethers (and also the saturated aliphatic and 
the simple aromatic hydrocarbons) do not react with sodium. Treat 1.0 ml of the 
dried compound with a small thin slice of freshly cut sodium (handle with the 
tongs or with a penknife) in a small dry test tube. Observe whether hydrogen is 
evolved and the sodium reacts. 

The acetyl chloride test. Acetyl chloride reacts vigorously with primary and 
secondary alcohols with the evolution of hydrogen chloride. Ethers are un- 
affected by acetyl chloride. In a small dry test tube place 0.5 ml of the dried com- 
pound with 0.3-0.4 ml of redistilled acetyl chloride and note whether reaction 
occurs. Add 3 ml of water and neutralise the aqueous layer with solid sodium 
hydrogen carbonate and note whether the smell of the products is different from 
that of the original alcohol. The product in the case of a tertiary alcohol is 
mainly the alkyl chloride. 

Differentiation between primary, secondary and tertiary alcohols. The three 
classes of alcohols differ in their behaviour on oxidation with hot acidic di- 
chromate solution. Primary alcohols yield aldehydes and secondary alcohols 

1223 



9.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



yield ketones; these products are readily distinguishable. Tertiary alcohols yield 
no carbonyl product under the conditions of the reaction; experimental details 
are given in Section 9.6.4, p. 1241. 

For the preparation of derivatives of alcohols and ethers see Section 9.6.4, p. 
1241 and Sections 9.6.10, p. 1254, and 9.6.11, p. 1255 respectively. 

POLYHYDRIC ALCOHOLS AND CARBOHYDRATES 

If the neutral substance containing carbon, hydrogen and possibly oxygen is in- 
soluble in ether but freely soluble in water, a polyhydric alcohol or a simple 
mono- or di-saccharide (or related compound) is indicated. Treatment with con- 
centrated sulphuric acid usually produces excessive charring. 

Polyhydric alcohols are colourless viscous liquids, or crystalline solids. Upon 
heating with a little potassium hydrogen sulphate, they may yield aldehydes (e.g. 
ethylene glycol yields acetaldehyde; glycerol gives the irritating odour of 
acrolein which can additionally be detected with Schiffs reagent). Two confirm- 
atory tests for polyhydric alcohols are as follows. 

Boric acid test. Add a few drops of phenolphthalein to a 1 per cent solution of 
borax; a pink coloration is produced. The addition of the polyhydric alcohol 
causes the pink colour to disappear, but it reappears on warming and vanishes 
again on cooling. This reaction is due to the combination of two cis-hydroxyl 
groups of the compound with boric acid to form reversibly a much stronger 
monobasic acid.

Periodic acid test. (For 1 ,2-glycols and a-hydroxyaldehydes and ketones, Sec- 
tion 4.2.55, p. 454). Add 1 drop (0.05 ml) of concentrated nitric acid to 2.0 ml of a 
0.5 per cent aqueous solution of paraperiodic acid (H 5 IO g ) contained in a small 
test tube and shake well. Then introduce 1 drop or a small crystal of the com- 
pound. Shake the mixture for 15 seconds and add 1-2 drops of 5 per cent 
aqueous silver nitrate. The immediate production of a white precipitate (silver 
iodate) constitutes a positive test and indicates that the organic compound has 
been oxidised by the periodic acid. The test is based upon the fact that silver 
iodate is sparingly soluble in dilute nitric acid whereas silver periodate is very 
soluble: if too much nitric acid is present the silver iodate will not precipitate. 

An alternative procedure for the above test is as follows. Mix 2-3 ml of 2 per 
cent aqueous paraperiodic acid solution with 1 drop of dilute sulphuric acid (c. 
1.25 m) and add 20-30 mg of the compound. Shake the mixture for 5 minutes, 
and then pass sulphur dioxide through the solution until it acquires a pale 
yellow colour (to remove the excess of periodic acid and also iodic acid formed 
in the reaction). Add 1-2 ml of Schiffs reagent: the production of a violet colour 
constitutes a positive test. 

For the preparation of derivatives of polyhydric alcohols see under Alcohols 
and polyhydric alcohols, Section 9.6.4, p. 1241. 

Mono- and di-saccharides are colourless solids or syrupy liquids, which are 
freely soluble in water, practically insoluble in ether and other organic solvents, 
and neutral in reaction. Polysaccharides possess similar properties, but are 

1224 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION DF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.S 



generally insoluble in water because of their high molecular weights. Both poly- 
and di-saccharides are converted into monosaccharides upon hydrolysis. The 
following are confirmatory tests for carbohydrates. 

Molisch's test. This is a general test for carbohydrates. Place 5 mg of the sub- 
stance in a test tube containing 0.5 ml of water and mix it with 2 drops of a 10 per 
cent solution of 2-naphthol in ethanol or in chloroform. Allow 1 ml of concen- 
trated sulphuric acid to flow down the side of the inclined tube (it is best to use a 
dropper pipette) so that the acid forms a layer beneath the aqueous solution 
without mixing with it. If a carbohydrate is present, a red ring appears at the 
common surface of the liquids; the colour quickly changes on standing or 
shaking, a dark purple solution being formed. Shake and allow the mixture to 
stand for 2 minutes, then dilute with 5 ml of water. In the presence of a carbo- 
hydrate, a dull-violet precipitate will appear immediately. 

Barfoed's reagent. This reagent may be used as a general test for monosacchar- 
ides. Heat a test tube containing 1 ml of the reagent and 1 ml of a dilute solution 
of the carbohydrate in a beaker of boiling water. If red copper(i) oxide is formed 
within 2 minutes, a monosaccharide is present. Disaccharides on prolonged 
heating (about 10 minutes) may also cause reduction, owing to partial hydroly- 
sis to monosaccharides. 

The reagent is prepared by dissolving 13.3 g of crystallised neutral copper(n) 
acetate in 200 ml of 1 per cent acetic acid solution. The reagent does not keep 
well. 

Fehling's solution (test for reducing sugars). Place 5 ml of Fehling's solution 
(prepared by mixing equal volumes of Fehling's solution No. 1 and solution No. 
2) in a test tube and heat to gentle boiling. Add a solution of 0.1 g of the carbo- 
hydrate in 2 ml of water and continue to boil gently for a minute or two, and 
observe the result. A yellow or red precipitate of copper(i) oxide indicates the 
presence of a reducing sugar. An alternative method of carrying out the test is to 
add the hot Fehling's solution dropwise to the boiling solution of the carbo- 
hydrate; in the presence of a reducing sugar the blue colour will disappear and a 
yellow precipitate, changing to red, is thrown down. 

Benedict's solution. This is a modification of Fehling's solution and consists of a 
single test solution which does not deteriorate appreciably on standing. To 5 ml 
of Benedict's solution add 0.4 ml of a 2 per cent solution of the carbohydrate, 
boil for 2 minutes and allow to cool spontaneously. If no reducing sugar is 
present, the solution remains clear; in the presence of a reducing sugar, the solu- 
tion will contain copper(i) oxide. The test may also be carried out according to 
the experimental details given under Fehling's solution. 

The reagent is prepared as follows. Dissolve 86.5 g of crystallised sodium 
citrate (2Na 3 C 6 H507,llH 2 0) and 50g of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 
about 350 ml of water. Filter, if necessary. Add a solution of 8.65 g of crystallised 
copper(n) sulphate in 50 ml of water with constant stirring. Dilute to 500 ml. The 
resulting solution should be perfectly clear; if it is not, pour it through a fluted 
filter paper. 

Non-reducing sugars may be hydrolysed by boiling with dilute hydrochloric 
acid; if the solution is then neutralised with aqueous sodium hydroxide the 
reduction of Fehling's solution or Benedict's solution occurs readily.

For the preparation of derivatives of mono- and di-saccharides see Section 
9.6.5, p. 1245. 

HYDROCARBONS 

Hydrocarbons may be differentiated by their solubility in sulphuric acid since 
unsaturated hydrocarbons are soluble in concentrated sulphuric acid as are those 
arenes which are readily sulphonated, whereas the saturated alkanes and lesser 
reactive arenes are insoluble in this reagent. The presence of an alkene, alkyne or 
arene is usually readily apparent from an inspection of the infrared and nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectra, the characteristic features of which are fully dis- 
cussed in Sections 5.2., 5.3 and 6.1 respectively and in Chapter 3. 

The two tests employed for the detection of unsaturation are decolourisation 
of a dilute solution of bromine in dichloromethane, and reaction with dilute 
aqueous potassium permanganate. It is essential to apply both tests since some 
symmetrically substituted alkenes (e.g. stilbene, C 6 H s'CH^CH-CgHs) react 
only slowly under the conditions of the bromine test. With dilute potassium per- 
manganate solution the double bond is readily attacked, probably through the 
intermediate formation of a ris-diol. 

Ph-CH=CH-Ph -^&gt; Ph-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-Ph &gt; 2Ph-C0 2 H 

Bromine test. Dissolve 0.2 g or 0.2 ml of the compound in 2 ml of dichloro- 
methane, and add a 2 per cent solution of bromine in dichloromethane dropwise 
until the bromine colour persists for one minute. Blow across the mouth of the 
tube to detect any hydrogen bromide which may be evolved. 

Potassium permanganate test. Dissolve 0.2 g or 0.2 ml of the substance in 2 ml of 
water or in 2 ml of acetone (which gives a negative test with the reagent), and 
add 2 per cent potassium permanganate solution dropwise. The test is negative if 
no more than 3 drops of the reagent are decolourised. 

Differention between alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons. The most satisfactory 
reagent is fuming sulphuric acid. Place 2 ml of 20 per cent fuming sulphuric acid 
in a dry test tube, add 0.5 ml of the hydrocarbon and shake vigorously. Only the 
aromatic hydrocarbon dissolves completely, heat is evolved, but excessive 
charring should be absent. Warm the solution gently, cool and pour cautiously 
on to crushed ice; the aromatic hydrocarbon which undergoes sulphonation 
gives a homogeneous aqueous solution. 

For the preparation of derivatives and for further characterisation of alkanes, 
alkenes, alkynes and arenes see Sections 9.6.1, p. 1235, 9.6.2, p. 1235, and 9.6.3, 
p. 1238 respectively. 

COMPOUNDS CONTAINING NITROGEN 

The neutral nitrogen compounds include: tertiary aliphatic nitro compounds 
and aromatic nitro compounds; amides (simple and substituted); nitrogen deriv- 
atives of aldehydes and ketones (hydrazones, semicarbazones, etc.); nitriles; 
nitroso, azo, hydrazo and other intermediate reduction products of aromatic 
nitro compounds. The imides, primary and secondary nitro compounds, oximes 
and primary sulphonamides are weakly acidic nitrogen compounds. All the 
above nitrogen compounds and also the secondary sulphonamides, with few 

1226 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.5 



exceptions, respond to the same classification reactions (reduction and hydroly- 
sis) and hence will be considered together (experimental procedures below). 

a-Amino acids are appreciably water-soluble giving solutions which are 
essentially neutral towards indicator paper. Water-insoluble a-amino acids are 
readily soluble in both dilute alkali and dilute acid as the result of their ampho- 
teric character. 

In most instances, confirmation of the presence of any of the above functional 
groups may be obtained from a consideration of the spectroscopic properties of 
the compound. 

Nitro compounds and their reduction products. Tertiary aliphatic nitro com- 
pounds and aromatic nitro compounds are reduced by zinc and ammonium 
chloride solution to the corresponding hydroxylamines, which may be detected 
by their reducing action upon an ammoniacal solution of silver nitrate or 
Tollen's reagent: 

R-N0 2 + 4[H] *" &gt; R-NHOH + H 2 

z NH 4 C1 aq. '■ 

It must be remembered, however, that nitroso, azoxy and azo compounds 
(which are usually more highly coloured than nitro compounds) may be reduced 
by zinc powder to the corresponding hydroxylamine, hydrazo and hydrazine 
compounds respectively, all of which reduce Tollen's reagent in the cold. 

Nitro compounds are reduced in acid solution (for example, by tin and hydro- 
chloric acid) to the corresponding primary amines. 

R-N0 2 + 6[H] &gt;■ RNH 2 + 2H 2 

Nitrosamines are similarly reduced to secondary amines: 

R 2 N-NO + 6[H] &gt; R 2 NH + NH 3 + H 2 

The AT-nitrosamines (and some C-nitroso compounds that yield nitrous acid 
when treated with concentrated sulphuric acid) may be detected by Lieber- 
mann's reaction (p. 1216). 

Azo compounds may be identified by examination of the amine(s) formed on 
reduction in acid solution. 

R 1 -N=N-R 2 + 4[H] y R J NH 2 + H 2 NR 2 

They are always coloured but give colourless products upon reduction. Hydrazo 
and azoxy compounds are reduced in acid solution to the parent amine. 

Amides. Simple {primary) amides when warmed with dilute sodium hydroxide 
solution give ammonia readily, together with the salt of the corresponding acid: 

R-CONH 2 + H 2 &gt; R-C0 2 H + NH 3 

Complete hydrolysis may be effected by boiling either with 10 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution or with 10 per cent sulphuric acid for 1-3 hours. It is prefer- 
able to employ the non-volatile sulphuric acid for acid hydrolysis; this acid 
should also be used for acidification of the solution resulting from alkaline 
hydrolysis so that any volatile organic acid (formic acid, acetic acid, etc.) may be 
distilled off. 

Substitute amides undergo hydrolysis with greater difficulty. The choice of an 
acid or an alkaline medium will depend upon the solubility of the compound in 

1227 



9.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



the medium, and the effect of the reagent upon the products of hydrolysis. Sub- 
stituted amides of comparatively low molecular weight (e.g. acetanilide) may be 
hydrolysed by boiling either with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution or with 
10 per cent sulphuric acid for 2-3 hours. Other substituted amides are so insol- 
uble in water that little reaction occurs when they are refluxed with dilute acid or 
dilute alkali for several hours. These include such substances as benzanilide or 
the benzotoluidides. For these substances satisfactory results may be obtained 
with 70 per cent sulphuric acid*: this hydrolysis medium is a much better solvent 
for the substituted amide than is water or more dilute acid; it also permits a 
higher reaction temperature. 

R'-CONHR 2 + H 2 ^i&gt; Ri.C0 2 H + R 2 NH 3 }HSO® 

Nitrites. These are best hydrolysed by boiling either with 30-40 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution or with 50-70 per cent sulphuric acid during several hours, 
but the reaction takes place less readily than for primary amides. Indeed the 
latter are intermediate products in the hydrolysis: 

R-CN + H 2 -^U R-CONH 2 ^U R-COf + NH 3 

Nitriles and simple amides differ in physical properties: the former are liquids or 
low-melting solids, while the latter are generally solids. If the amide is a solid 
and insoluble in water, it may be readily prepared from the nitrile by dissolving 
in concentrated sulphuric acid and pouring the solution into water: 

R . CN ?*% [R-C=NH]HSO? -^ R-CONH 2 

Oximes, hydrazones and semicarbazones. The hydrolysis products of these com- 
pounds, i.e. aldehydes and ketones, may be sensitive to alkali (this is particularly 
so for aldehydes): it is best, therefore, to conduct the hydrolysis with strong 
mineral acid. After hydrolysis the aldehyde or ketone may be isolated by distilla- 
tion with steam, extraction with ether or, if a solid, by filtration, and then identi- 
fied. The acid solution may be examined for hydroxylamine or hydrazine or 
semicarbazide; substituted hydrazines of the aromatic series are precipitated as 
oils or solids upon the addition of alkali. 

R'R 2 C=NOH + H 2 -^U R'R 2 C=0 + NH 2 OH 

Imides. Imides are generally water-soluble, consequently they are much more 
readily hydrolysed in an alkaline medium, e.g. by refluxing with 10 per cent 
sodium hydroxide solution: 

(R-CO) 2 NH ^&gt; 2R-C0 2 e + NH 3 

Sulphonamides. Sulphonamides are very resistant to the normal reagents for 
hydrolysis. Heating with 80 per cent sulphuric acid at 160-170 °C results in 
rapid hydrolysis.

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.S 



The following methods represent typical procedures for the reduction or 
hydrolysis of these nitrogen-containing compounds. 

(a) Reduction of a nitro compound to a hydroxylamine. Dissolve 0.5 g of the com- 
pound in 10 ml of 50 per cent ethanol, add 0.5 g of solid ammonium chloride and 
about 0.5 g of zinc powder. Heat to boiling and allow the ensuing chemical reac- 
tion to proceed for 5 minutes. Filter from the excess of zinc powder and test the 
filtrate with Tollen's reagent (see p. 1219). An immediate black or grey precipitate 
or a silver mirror indicates the presence of a hydroxylamine formed by the 
reduction of the nitro compound. Alternatively, warm the filtrate with Fehling's 
solution: a hydroxylamine will precipitate red copper(i) oxide. (A blank test 
should be performed with the original compound.) 

(b) Reduction of a nitro compound to a primary amine. In a 50-ml round- 
bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, place 1 g of the nitro compound 
and 2g of granulated tin. Measure out 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid 
and add it in three equal portions to the mixture; shake thoroughly after each 
addition. When the vigorous reaction subsides, heat under reflux on a water 
bath until the nitro compound has completely reacted (20-30 minutes). Shake 
the reaction mixture from time to time; if the nitro compound appears to be very 
insoluble, add 5 ml of ethanol. Cool the reaction mixture, and add 20-40 per 
cent sodium hydroxide solution until the precipitate of tin hydroxide dissolves. 
Extract the resulting amine from the cooled solution with ether, and remove the 
ether by distillation. Examine the residue with regard to its solubility in 5 per 
cent hydrochloric acid and its reaction with acetyl chloride or benzenesulphonyl 
chloride. 

(c) Reduction of a nitrosamine to a secondary amine. Proceed as for a nitro com- 
pound. Determine the solubility of the residue after evaporation of the ether and 
also its behaviour towards benzenesulphonyl (or toluene-p-sulphonyl) chloride. 

(d) Hydrolysis of simple {primary) amides in alkaline solution. Boil 0.5 g of the 
compound with 5 ml of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and observe 
whether ammonia is evolved. 

(e) Hydrolysis of a substituted amide. 1. With 10 per cent sulphuric acid. Reflux 
1 g of the compound (e.g. acetanilide) with 20 ml of 10 per cent sulphuric acid for 
1-2 hours. Distil the reaction mixture and collect 10 ml of distillate: this will con- 
tain any volatile organic acids which may be present. Cool the residue, render it 
alkaline with 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, cool and extract with ether. 
Distil off the ether and examine the ether-soluble residue for an amine. 

2. With 70 per cent sulphuric acid. Reflux 1 g of the substance (e.g. benzanilide) 
with 10-15 ml of 70 per cent sulphuric acid (4:3 by volume) for 30 minutes. 
Allow to cool and wash down any acid which has sublimed into the condenser 
with hot water. Filter off the acid, wash it with water and examine for solubility, 
etc. Render the filtrate alkaline with 10-20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, 
cool and extract with ether. Examine the residue, after evaporation of the ether, 
for an amine. 

if) Hydrolysis of a niltrile to an acid. Reflux 1 g of the nitrile with 5 ml of 30-40 
per cent sodium hydroxide solution until ammonia ceases to be evolved (2-3 
hours). Dilute with 5 ml of water and add, with cooling, 7 ml of 50 per cent sul- 



1229 



9.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



phuric acid. Isolate the acid by ether extraction, and examine its solubility and 
other properties. 

(g) Hydrolysis of a nitrile to an amide. Warm a solution of 1 g of the nitrile in 
4 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid to 80-90 °C, and allow the solution to stand 
for 5 minutes. Cool and pour the solution cautiously into 40 ml of cold water. 
Filter off the precipitate; stir it with 20 ml of cold 5 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution and filter again. Recrystallise the amide from dilute ethanol, and deter- 
mine its m.p. Examine the solubility behaviour and also the action of warm 
sodium hydroxide solution upon the amide. 

(h) Hydrolysis of a sulphonamide. Mix 2 g of the sulphonamide with 3.5 ml of 80 
per cent sulphuric acid* in a test tube and place a thermometer in the mixture. 
Heat the test tube, with frequent stirring by means of the thermometer, at 155- 
165 °C until the solid passes into solution (2-5 minutes). Allow the acid solution 
to cool and pour it into 25-30 ml of water. Render the resulting solution alkaline 
with 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution in order to liberate the free amine. 
Two methods may be used for isolating the base. If the amine is volatile in steam, 
distil the alkaline solution and collect about 20 ml of distillate: extract the amine 
with ether, dry the ethereal solution with anhydrous potassium carbonate and 
distil off the solvent. If the amine is not appreciably steam-volatile, extract it 
from the alkaline solution with ether. The sulphonic acid (as sodium salt) in the 
residual solution may be identified by conversion into a suitable derivative 
(Section 9.6.26, p. 1284). 

For further methods for the characterisation of these nitrogen-containing 
compounds see Sections 9.6.18, p. 1270, 9.6.20, p. 1271, and 9.6.24, p. 1281 and 
9.6.27, p. 1286. 

a-Amino acids. These are in general insoluble (or very sparingly soluble) in 
organic solvents such as ether or toluene, sparingly soluble in ethanol, usually 
soluble in water and neutral in reaction. They have no true melting points, but 
decompose on heating at temperatures between 120 and 300 °C; the apparent 
melting points vary considerably according to the conditions of heating and are 
therefore of no great value for purposes of identification. The following tests 
may be used to confirm the presence of an a-amino acid. 

The ninhydrin test. Heat a solution of the compound with a few drops of a 0.25 
per cent aqueous solution of ninhydrin (Expt 5.99). a-Amino acids give a blue- 
violet coloration. This highly sensitive test is also given by some /?-amino acids 
and by some peptides and proteins, particularly on warming. The colour test is of 
great value in the characterisation of the a-amino acids separated by t.l.c, and 
the R F values are useful aids to identification. 

Copper complex formation. Add a few drops of aqueous copper(n) sulphate 
solution to an aqueous solution of the amino acid. A deep blue coloration is 
obtained. The deep blue copper derivative may be isolated by boiling a solution 
of the amino acid with precipitated copper(n) hydroxide or with copper(n) car- 
bonate, filtering and concentrating the solution. These blue complexes are co- 
ordination compounds of the structure: 



* Prepared by cautiously adding 3 vol. of concentrated sulphuric acid to 1 vol. of water.

Nitrous acid test. The conditions of the test are similar to those described for the 
classification of primary amines (Section 9.5.2, p. 1215), but using acetic acid in 
place of hydrochloric acid. An a-amino acid yields nitrogen and an a-hydroxy 
acid. 

For the preparation of derivatives of a-amino acids, see Section 9.6.23, p. 1279. 

COMPOUNDS CONTAINING SULPHUR 

The neutral sulphur compounds include sulphides or thioethers, disulphides, 
sulphoxides and sulphones, sulphate and sulphonate esters, and isothiocyanates. 
Acidic sulphur compounds, i.e. sulphonic and sulphinic acids, thiols and thio- 
phenols, and the primary sulphonamides have already been discussed. The sul- 
phates of amines are converted by aqueous sodium hydroxide into the free 
bases; the sulphate anion can be detected in the resulting aqueous solution as 
barium sulphate in the usual manner. 

Those compounds which contain the highly polar S=0 group exhibit char- 
acteristic strong adsorption bands in the fingerprint region of the i.r. spectra. 
Two such bands originate from the symmetrical and asymmetrical stretching 
vibrations of the S=0 groups (see Sections 5.17 and 6.4). 

Sulphides (thioethers). The organic sulphides are usually liquids with penetrat- 
ing and disagreeable odours. In contrast to the oxygen analogues (ethers), they 
are readily oxidised; thus sulphoxides are produced with hydrogen peroxide, 
and sulphones with nitric acid or with potassium permanganate in glacial acetic 
acid solution (see Section 5.17.3, p. 791). 

R '- s W+ Rl - S=0 JSM^ R &gt;t° 

R 2 R 2 R 2 ^ ^O 

Thioethers usually yield sulphonium salts when warmed with ethyl iodide and 
allowed to cool. The physical properties (b.p. density and refractive index) are 
useful for identification purposes. 

Disulphides. Disulphides are liquids or low m.p. solids and have unpleasant 
odours, particularly if liquid. They are reduced by zinc and dilute acids to the 
thiols. 

R S-S R + 2[H] ► 2RSH 

Sulphoxides. These are usually solids of low m.p. They may be oxidised in 
glacial acetic acid solution by potassium permanganate to the corresponding 
sulphones, and reduced to the sulphides by boiling with tin or zinc and hydro- 
chloric acid. 

Sulphones. Sulphones are usually crystalline solids, and are extremely stable to 
most oxidising, reducing and hydrolytic reagents. 

Esters of sulphuric acid. These compounds are generally water-insoluble liquids 

1231 



9.5 PRACTICAL 0R6ANIC CHEMISTRY 



and are saponified by boiling with water or dilute alkali to the corresponding 
alcohols and sulphuric acid: 

R 2 SC&gt;4 + 2H 2 ► 2ROH + H 2 S0 4 

The simple dialkyl sulphates, in particular dimethyl sulphate, are markedly toxic 
(see Section 4.2.24, p. 430). They may be characterised as the alkyl 2-naphthyl 
ethers (cf. alkyl halides, Section 9.6.8, p. 1251; and also Expt 6.111). 

The alkyl esters of sulphonic acids exhibit properties similar to those of the 
alkyl sulphates, and are hydrolysed, by boiling with aqueous alkalis, to the cor- 
responding alcohols and sulphonic acids. Thus with ethyl toluene-p-sulphonate: 

p-Me-C 6 H 4 -S0 2 OEt + H 2 &gt; p-Me-C 6 H 4 -S0 3 H + EtOH 

The salts of monoalkyl sulphates are frequently encountered as commercial 
detergents: these are usually sodium salts, the alkyl components contain 12 or 
more carbon atoms, and they give colloidal solutions. They are hydrolysed by 
boiling with dilute sodium hydroxide solution: 

ROS0 2 -ONa + NaOH &gt;■ ROH + NaS0 4 

Isothiocyanates. These compounds, also known as mustard oils are oils or low 
melting point solids, and usually possess irritating odours. Upon boiling with 
acids, for example with concentrated hydrochloric acid, they are hydrolysed to 
the primary amines and hydrogen sulphide is evolved: 

R-NCS + HC1 + 2H 2 &gt; RNH 3 }C1 + C0 2 + H 2 S 

They react with amines to form substituted thioureas: 

R^NCS + R 2 NH 2 &gt;■ R^H-CS-NHR 2 

This reaction is also employed for the characterisation of amines (see Section 
9.6.21, p. 1273). 

COMPOUNDS CONTAINING HALOGEN 

The spectroscopic features (i.r., p.m.r., and m.s.) of aliphatic and aromatic 
halogen-containing compounds are summarised in Section 5.5 and 6.3 respect- 
ively. 

Reactivities of halogen compounds. A halogen substituent in an organic com- 
pound is an inert functional group in the sense that it has relatively little effect 
on the solubility characteristics of the parent compound or upon the properties 
of other functional groups which may be present. For the purposes of classifica- 
tion and characterisation therefore the presence of the halogen is to a certain 
extent immaterial. Halogen may of course be present in the ionic form (i.e. in a 
salt), and then may readily be detected in the usual way with aqueous silver 
nitrate. Highly reactive halogen compounds, typically acid halides, will also 
respond to this test. With other, neutral, halogen compounds, it is useful to 
examine their behaviour towards ethanolic silver nitrate, and to categorise their 
reactivity in the following way: 

Reaction with ethanolic silver nitrate. Treat 2 ml of a 2 per cent solution of silver 
nitrate in ethanol with 1 or 2 drops (or 0.05 g) of the compound. If no appre- 

1232 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.S 



ciable precipitate appears at the laboratory temperature, heat in a boiling water 
bath for a few minutes. Some organic acids give insoluble silver salts, hence it is 
advisable to add 1 drop of dilute (5%) nitric acid at the conclusion of the test: 
most silver salts of organic acids are soluble in aqueous nitric acid. (CAUTION: 
On no account should concentrated nitric acid be used; a dangerous explosion may 
result.) 

Organic compounds containing halogen react with ethanolic silver nitrate in 
the following order of decreasing reactivity: 

1. Water-soluble compounds containing ionisable halogen or compounds such 
as acyl halides of low molecular weight which readily yield ionisable com- 
pounds with water will react immediately, even with aqueous silver nitrate. 

2. Acyl and sulphonyl halides, a-halogeno-ethers and alkyl iodides react rapidly. 

3. Alkyl chlorides and bromides, aromatic compounds containing halogen in the 

side chain, or nuclear-halogenated aromatic compounds with nitro groups in 
the ortho and/or para position, do not usually react readily at room temperat- 
ure but react fairly rapidly on heating. The order of reactivity of alkyl halides 
is tertiary &gt; secondary &gt; primary, and indeed some tertiary halides may 
react in the cold. 

4. Aromatic compounds in which the halogen is attached directly to the aro- 
matic nucleus and polyhalogenated compounds with three or more halogens 
on the same carbon atom do not react even on heating. 

Further classification of halogen compounds. Two further reactions aid the 
classification of halogen compounds. 

Reaction with ethanolic potassium hydroxide. Boil 0.5 ml of the compound with 
4 ml of 0.5 m ethanolic potassium hydroxide under reflux for 15 minutes. Most 
alkyl halides and benzyl halides give a crystalline precipitate of the potassium 
halide. Dilute with 5 ml of water, acidify with dilute nitric acid and test with 
silver nitrate solution. 

The 0.5 m ethanolic potassium hydroxide solution is prepared by dissolving 
16 g of potassium hydroxide pellets in 500 ml of ethanol in a bottle closed with a 
cork. After standing for 24 hours, the clear solution is decanted and filtered from 
the residue of potassium carbonate. It is said that a solution in methanol has 
better keeping qualities than that in ethanol. 

Halogen exchange reaction. This is based upon the fact that sodium chloride 
and sodium bromide are sparingly soluble in pure acetone: 

RCl(Br) + Nal &gt;■ RI + NaCl(Br)J. 

The test consists in treating a solution of sodium iodide in pure acetone with the 
organic compound. The reaction is probably of the Sjv2 type involving a bi- 
molecular attack of the iodide ion upon the carbon atom carrying the chlorine 
or bromine; the order of reactivities of halides is: primary &gt; secondary &gt; terti- 
ary and Br &gt; CI. 

Primary bromides give a precipitate of sodium bromide within 3 minutes at 
25 °C; chlorides react only when heated at 50 °C for up to 6 minutes. Secondary 
and tertiary bromides must be heated at 50 °C for up to 6 minutes, but tertiary 
chlorides do not react within this time. 

1,2-Dichloro and dibromo compounds give a precipitate with the reagent 
and also liberate free iodine: 

1233 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



R'-CHBr-CHBr-R 2 + 2NaI &gt; R'-CHI-CHI-R 2 + 2NaBr 



R'CH=CH-R 2 + I 2 

Polybromo compounds (bromoform, s-tetrabromoethane) react at 50 °C, but 
simple polychloro compounds (chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and trichloro- 
acetic acid) do not. 

Sulphonyl chlorides give an immediate precipitate and also liberate iodine: 

Ar-S0 2 Cl + Nal ^^&gt; Ar-S0 2 I - !M -&gt; Ar-S0 2 Na + I 2 

Acid chlorides and bromides, allyl halides, and a-halo-ketones, -esters, -amides 
and -nitriles react at 25 °C within 3 minutes. Vinyl and aryl halides are inert. 

Prepare the reagent by dissolving 7.5 g of sodium iodide in 50 ml of AnalaR 
acetone. The colourless solution gradually acquires a yellow colour. Keep it in a 
dark bottle. When a red-brown colour develops, it should be discarded. 

For the preparation of derivatives of alkyl and aryl halides see Sections 9.6.8, 
p. 1251 and 9.6.9, p. 1253 respectively. 



9.6 PREPARATION OF DERIVATIVES 

Before the development and widespread application of spectroscopic methods 
for the elucidation of structure, confirmation of the class type of an unknown 
organic compound was completed by the preparation of two or more crystalline 
functional derivatives. If the compounds had been previously reported in the 
literature, agreement between the published physical constants of the derivatives 
with those prepared by the worker was accepted as proof of identity. In many 
cases, and particularly in natural product chemistry, functional group recogni- 
tion led to oxidative, reductive, or hydrolytic breakdown into smaller carbon- 
containing fragments. These were, if necessary, separated, characterised and 
identified by derivative preparation. The reassembly of the 'jig-saw' of fragments 
inferred by the identity of the fission products, then led to postulated structures. 

Derivative preparation provides the developing organic chemist with an im- 
portant area of study for the following reasons. 

Firstly, the combination of spectroscopic information and reactivity tests 
enables the classification of the compound to be made with greater certainty, 
leading to derivative selection to be made with greater confidence. The require- 
ments of a satisfactory derivative include the following: 

1. The derivative should be easily and quickly prepared in good yield by an 
unambiguous reaction, and be easily purified. In practice, this generally 
means that the derivative must be a solid, because of the greater ease of 
manipulation of small quantities of solids, and the fact that melting points are 
more accurately and more easily determined than boiling points. The melting 
point should preferably be above 50 °C, but below 250 °C; compounds which 
melt below 50 °C are frequently difficult to recrystallise. 

2. The derivative should be prepared preferably by a general reaction, which 
under the same experimental conditions would yield a definite derivative with 

1234 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.E 



the other likely compounds. Rearrangements and side reactions should be 
avoided. 

3. The properties (physical and chemical) of the derivatives should be markedly 
different from those of the original compound. 

4. It should be borne in mind that when a compound has several functional 
groups, that functional group should be chosen for the preparation of the 
derivative which gives the least ambiguous reaction. 

Secondly, the description of the general procedures given below, as distinct 
from the specific experimental procedures of the preparations described in 
earlier chapters, provides an excellent opportunity for the student to explore on 
the small scale the optimum reaction conditions, the chromatographic monitor- 
ing of the reaction, the methods of isolation and purification procedures (solvent 
extraction, recrystallisation, etc.) for the successful completion of the prepara- 
tion. The small-scale nature of the experiments is of particular importance in 
providing experience of those techniques of reaction work-up in which mechan- 
ical loss is frequently the reason for failure. Such experience is vital to the syn- 
thetic chemist since many of the new chemo-, regio- and stereo-specific reagents 
are expensive and used in small-scale reactions. 

Thirdly, some of the derivatives provide protection of the functional group, 
and their preparation, chemical reactivity, and deprotection procedures may be 
of value in the design of synthetic strategies. 

The methods of preparation of some of the more important derivatives of a 
number of classes of organic compounds are described in the following sections. 
These sections are cross-referenced with tables incorporating the melting points 
and boiling points of the compounds themselves, and also the melting points of 
selected derivatives. For convenience, the references to the various derivative 
preparations and tables are collected in Table 9.2. 

9.6.1 SATURATED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS 

Because of the chemical inertness of the saturated aliphatic hydrocarbons and of 
the closely related cycloalkanes, no satisfactory crystalline derivatives can be 
prepared. A pure sample may be characterised by consideration of such physical 
properties such as the boiling point, the refractive index (and/or the density), 
and these physical constants are listed in Table 10.1. If required, confirmation of 
structure should be sought from a more detailed study of appropriate spectra, 
particularly 13 C-n.m.r., and mass spectra. 

9.6.2 UNSATURATED ALIPHATIC HYDROCARBONS 

DERIVATIVES OF ALKENES 

The alkenes are distinguished from the alkanes by their solubility in concen- 
trated sulphuric acid and their characteristic reactions with dilute potassium 
permanganate solution and with bromine. Characterisation may be based upon 
the determination of their physical and/or spectral properties. Characterisation 
by way of solid adducts with nitrosyl chloride has been quite widely used in the 
terpene field; the preparation of adducts with 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulphenyl 
chloride is described below (see also Section 8.1.1, p. 1128).

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.6 



ADDUCTS WITH 2,4-DINITROBENZENESULPHENYL CHLORIDE 

2,4-Dinitrobenzenesulphenyl chloride reacts in polar solvents (acetone, 1,2- 
dichloroethane, acetic acid and dimethylformamide) with alkenes to yield crys- 
talline adducts, the /?-chloroalkyl-2,4-dinitrophenyl sulphides, e.g.: 

R-CH=CH 2 + 2,4-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 SCl &gt; R-CHCl-CH 2 -S-C 6 H 3 (N0 2 ) 2 -2,4 

Addition of the reagent is stereospecific (trans addition) and one can thus differ- 
entiate between cis and trans isomers: thus cis-butene and trans-butene give 
products of m.p. 129 and 77 °C respectively. 

Heat a solution of 0.2 g of the reagent and 0.2-0.3 g of the alkene in glacial 
acetic acid on the steam bath for 15 minutes or until the potassium iodide test 
shows that the reaction is complete. Cool the mixture in ice. If a solid separates, 
filter it off; if not, pour the reaction mixture on to 5-10 g of crushed ice. Recrys- 
tallise the resulting solid or oil from ethanol. Test: Add a drop of the reaction 
solution to a drop of potassium iodide solution on a spot plate; the presence of 
unreacted reagent is revealed by the liberation of iodine: 

2RSC1 + 2I e &gt;■ RSSR + I 2 + 2Cl e 



DERIVATIVES OF ALKYNES 

ADDITION PRODUCTS WITH 2,4-DINITROBENZENESULPHENYL 
CHLORIDE 

The reagent reacts with symmetrical alkynes as follows: 

R-C^C-R + ArSCl &gt;■ R-C(Cl)=C(SAr)-R; Ar = 2,4-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 

Dissolve 1.60 g of the reagent in 15 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane at 0°C and add 
3.0 ml of the ice-cold alkyne. Keep at 0°C for 2 hours, remove the solvent by 
aspiration and keep the clear yellow oil in a refrigerator until crystallisation 
occurs. Dissolve the crystals in 25 ml of absolute ethanol, decolourise with char- 
coal and filter. Concentrate the filtrate, collect the crystals which separate and 
recrystallise from ethanol. 

MERCURIDES OF MONOSUBSTITUTED ALKYNES 

Monosubstituted alkynes form mercurides which are suitable for identification 
purposes: 

2R-Cs=CH + K 2 [HgI 4 ] + 2KOH &gt;■ (R-C=C) 2 Hg + 4KI + 2H 2 

The procedure consists in adding a dilute solution of the alkyne in ethanol to an 
excess of an alkaline mercury(n) iodine reagent: a white or greyish-white precip- 
itate forms immediately, which is filtered off, washed with dilute ethanol and 
recrystallised. The yield of mercuride is 85-95 per cent. 

The mercury(n) iodide reagent is prepared by dissolving 6.6 g of mercury(n) 
chloride (POISONOUS) in a solution of 16.3 g of potassium iodide in 16.3 ml of 
water and adding 12.5 ml of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. 

Into a cooled dilute solution of 2 equivalents of alkaline mercury(n) iodide 
reagent, drop slowly, with mechanical stirring, a solution of 1 equivalent of the 
monosubstituted alkyne in 20 volumes of 95 per cent ethanol. A white crystalline 



1237 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



precipitate separates at once. Stir for 2-3 minutes, filter rapidly with suction and 
wash with 50 per cent ethanol. Recrystallise from ethanol or benzene. 
Data for a selection of alkenes and alkynes are collected in Table 10.2. 

9.6.3 AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS 

For characterisation, aromatic hydrocarbons can be sulphonated, chloro- 
sulphonated, carboxybenzoylated and nitrated. Polynuclear aromatic hydro- 
carbons, and many of their derivatives, yield crystalline adducts with picric acid, 
styphnic acid, 1,3,5-trinitro benzene and 2,4,7-trinitrofluorenone. 

SULPHONAMIDES 

Aromatic hydrocarbons react with chlorosulphonic acid to yield the corres- 
ponding sulphonyl chlorides (the process is known as chlorosulphonatiori). These 
do not usually crystallise well and are therefore converted into the sulphona- 
mides by treatment with concentated ammonia solution or with solid ammo- 
nium carbonate. (See also Section 6.4.2, p. 877.) 

ArH + 2H0S0 2 C1 ► Ar-S0 2 Cl + H 2 S0 4 + HC1 

Ar-S0 2 Cl + (NH 4 ) 2 C0 3 &gt; Ar-S0 2 NH 2 + NH 4 C1 + C0 2 + H 2 

Dissolve 1.0 g of the compound in 5 ml of dry (CaCl 2 ) chloroform in a dry test 
tube, cool it in a beaker of ice and add 3-5 ml of chlorosulphonic acid (CAU- 
TION) dropwise. When the evolution of hydrogen chloride has subsided, 
remove the test tube from the ice bath and allow to stand at room temperature 
for 20-30 minutes; then pour on to crushed ice (30 g). Separate the chloroform 
layer, wash it with water, dry (CaCl 2 ), and evaporate the solvent. 

Boil the arenesulphonyl chloride (0.5 g) with 5 ml of aqueous ammonia 
(rfO.88) for 10 minutes (fume cupboard). Cool the reaction mixture and dilute it 
with 10 ml of water. Filter off the sulphonamide, wash it with water and recrys- 
tallise from dilute ethanol. 

Alternatively, heat a mixture of 0.5 g of the arenesulphonyl chloride with 2.8 g 
of dry powdered ammonium carbonate at 100 °C during 30 minutes. Wash the 
residue with several portions (10 ml) of cold water, filter and recrystallise from 
dilute ethanol. 

If the presence of a sulphone is suspected (cf. Aromatic halogen compounds, 
Section 9.6.9, p. 1256), treat the product with 6 m sodium hydroxide solution 
(only the sulphonamide dissolves), filter and reprecipitate the sulphonamide 
with 6 m hydrochloric acid. 

o-AROYLBENZOIC ACIDS 

Aromatic hydrocarbons react with phthalic anhydride in the presence of anhyd- 
rous aluminium chloride producing aroylbenzoic acids in good yields. The pro- 
cess is termed carboxybenzoylation. See formulation on p. 1008. 

Place a mixture of 1.0 g of the hydrocarbon, 10 ml of dry dichloromethane or 
1,2-dichloroethane, 2.5 g of powdered anhydrous aluminium chloride and 1.2 g 
of pure phthalic anhydride in a 25-50 ml round-bottomed flask fitted with a 
reflux condenser (127 mm jacket). Heat on a water bath for 30 minutes (or until 
no more hydrogen chloride fumes are evolved). Cool in ice and add 10 ml of con- 
centrated hydrochloric acid cautiously and with constant shaking. When the 
reaction has subsided, add 20 ml of water and shake vigorously. (All the solid 

1238 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.6 



material should pass into solution.) Transfer the two-phase system to a separ- 
atory funnel, add 25 ml of ether and shake. Discard the lower aqueous phase. 
Wash the ethereal layer with 25 ml of 2.5 m hydrochloric acid to ensure removal 
of any aluminium salts present. Shake the ethereal solution cautiously with 
25 ml of m sodium carbonate solution, and run the aqueous phase slowly into 
30 ml of m hydrochloric acid. Collect the aroylbenzoic acid by suction filtration, 
wash it with 25-50 ml of water and recrystallise it from dilute ethanol or from 
acetic acid. The derivatives prepared from benzene and toluene crystallise with 
water of crystallisation; the latter is removed by drying at 100 °C. 

NITRO DERIVATIVES 

No general experimental details for the preparation of nitro derivatives can be 
given, as the ease of nitration and the product formed frequently depend upon 
the exact experimental conditions. Moreover some organic compounds react 
violently so that nitrations should always be conducted on a small scale. Typical 
procedures for benzene hydrocarbons are illustrated by the following concise 
notes for the nitration of benzene and toluene to yield the solid dinitro com- 
pounds. (Full experimental details are given in Expts 6.17 and 6.18). 

Benzene. Add 0.5 ml of benzene slowly and with shaking and cooling to a mix- 
ture of 4 ml each of concentrated sulphuric and nitric acids. Heat the mixture 
carefully until it just boils, cool and pour into excess of cold water. Filter off the 
precipitate, wash it free from acid and recrystallise it from dilute alcohol. 
w-Dinitrobenzene, m.p. 90 °C, is formed. 

Toluene. Proceed as for benzene but use 0.5 ml of toluene and a mixture of 3 ml 
of concentrated sulphuric acid and 2 ml of fuming nitric acid. Gently warm the 
mixture over a free flame for 1-2 minutes, cool and pour into 20 ml of ice-water. 
Recrystallise the product from dilute alcohol. 2,4- Dinitro toluene, m.p. 71 °C, is 
obtained. 

Conditions for the mononitration of naphthalene, typical of the more reactive 
polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, are to be found in Expt 6.17. Naphthalene 
can also be nitrated by a mixture of nitric acid and glacial acetic acid, a reagent 
also suitable for some polyalkylated benzenes. 

OXIDATION OF A SIDE CHAIN BY ALKALINE PERMANGANATE 

Aromatic hydrocarbons containing side chains may be oxidised to the corres- 
ponding acids: the results are generally satisfactory for compounds with one side 
chain (e.g. toluene or ethylbenzene -&gt; benzoic acid) or with two side chains (e.g. 
o-xylene -&gt; phthalic acid). 

Suspend in a round -bottomed flask 1 g of the substance in 75-80 ml of boiling 
water to which about 0.5 g of sodium carbonate crystals have been added, and 
introduce slowly 4 g of finely powdered potassium permanganate. Heat under 
reflux until the purple colour of the permanganate has disappeared (1-4 hours). 
Allow the mixture to cool and carefully acidify with dilute sulphuric acid. Heat 
the mixture under reflux for a further 30 minutes and then cool. Remove any 
excess of manganese dioxide by the addition of a little sodium metabisulphite. 
Filter the precipitated acid and recrystallise it from a suitable solvent (e.g. 
toluene, ethanol, dilute ethanol or water). If the acid does not separate from the 
solution, extract it with ether, toluene, or dichloromethane.

9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



PICRATES 

Many polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons form 1 : 1 molecular compounds (n- 
complexes) with picric acid, for example, naphthalene picrate 
C 10 H 8 - C 6 H2(NO 2 )3OH. Some picrates, e.g. anthracene picrate, are so unstable 
as to be decomposed by many, particularly hydroxylic, solvents; they therefore 
cannot be easily recrystallised but may be washed with a little ether and dried on 
a porous title. Their preparation may often be accomplished in such non- 
hydroxylic solvents as chloroform, benzene or ether. The picrates of hydro- 
carbons can be readily separated into their constituents by warming with dilute 
ammonia solution and filtering (if the hydrocarbon is a solid) through a moist 
filter paper. The filtrate contains the picric acid as the ammonium salt, and the 
hydrocarbon is left on the filter paper. 

Picrates are usually prepared by adding a hot solution of the compound in 
ethanol to a cold saturated ethanolic solution of picric acid, warming and allow- 
ing to cool; the derivative separates in a crystalline condition. It is filtered off, 
washed with a little ether and pressed on a porous tile. If the picrate is stable, it is 
recrystallised from ethanol, ethyl acetate, benzene or ether. Do not mistake the 
recrystallised reagent (m.p. 122 °C) for a picrate. 

The following are typical experimental details for the preparation of naphtha- 
lene picrate. Dissolve 0.1 g of naphthalene in the minimum of hot ethanol and 
add to 1 ml of a saturated solution of picric acid in ethanol. Warm the mixture 
and then cool to allow the product to crystallise. 

OTHER ADDITION COMPOUNDS 

Suitably reactive aromatic hydrocarbons also form crystalline 1 : 1 7i-complexes 
('styphnates') with styphnic acid (2,4,6-trinitroresorcinol). These derivatives do 
not crystallise quite so well as the corresponding picrates, but are frequently of 
great value. Benzene and its simple homologues do not give stable derivatives. 

Dissolve equimolecular amounts of the hydrocarbon and styphnic acid in the 
minimum volume of hot acetic acid and allow to cool. Filter off the crystalline 
derivative which separates, wash it with a little acetic acid and dry in the air. 
Determine the m.p. Recrystallise from acetic acid and again determine the m.p. 

Other 7r-complexing reagents are 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene and 2,4,7-trinitro-9- 
fluorenone (1). The crystalline adducts are usually formed in ethanol, glacial 
acetic acid, or toluene solution and recrystallised from similar solvents. They 
are useful both for the characterisation and also for the isolation of appropri- 
ately reactive aromatic hydrocarbons. 

Data for a number of typical aromatic hydrocarbons are collected in Table 
10.3.

9.6.4 ALCOHOLS AND POLYHYDRIC ALCOHOLS 

OXIDATION WITH 'CHROMIC ACID' 

A primary alcohol is oxidised by 'chromic acid' to the corresponding aldehyde 
while a secondary alcohol yields a ketone: tertiary alcohols are generally un- 
affected or are decomposed into non-ketonic products. Oxidation therefore pro- 
vides a method for distinguishing between primary, secondary and tertiary 
alcohols and characterisation of the carbonyl compound provides a means of 
identifying the alcohol: 

R-CH 2 OH -^-&gt; R-CHO R'-CH(OH)-R 2 -^U- R'-COR 2 

To an ice-cold mixture of 1.0 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and 5 ml of 
saturated aqueous potassium dichromate solution, add 2 ml of the alcohol or its 
concentrated aqueous solution. If the alcohol is not miscible with the reagent, 
shake the reaction mixture vigorously. After 5 minutes, dilute with an equal 
volume of water, distil and collect the first few ml of the aqueous distillate in a 
test tube cooled in ice. (Aldehydes and ketones are volatile in steam.) Test a por- 
tion of the distillate for a carbonyl compound with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine 
reagent (p. 1218). If a solid derivative is obtained, indicating that the compound 
was a primary or secondary alcohol, test a further portion with SchifTs reagent 
(p. 1291) to distinguish between the two possibilities. The derivative may be re- 
crystallised; the m.p. may give a preliminary indication of the identity of the 
alcohol. 

3,5-DINITROBENZOATES 

3.5-Dinitrobenzoyl chloride reacts with alcohols to form solid esters which 
possess sharp melting points and are therefore admirably suited for purposes of 
characterisation: 

3,5-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -COCl + ROH ► 3,5-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -C0 2 R + HC1 

The acid chloride is available commercially, but it is preferable to prepare it 
from the acid as and when required since 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride tends to 
undergo hydrolysis if kept for long periods, particularly if the stock bottle is fre- 
quently opened. The substance may, however, be stored under dry light petro- 
leum. 

Prepare the reagent in a fume cupboard in the following way. Mix 1.0 g of 3,5- 
dinitrobenzoic acid with 1.5 g of phosphorus pentachloride in a small, dry test 
tube. Warm the mixture gently over a small smoky flame to start the reaction; 
when the reaction has subsided (but not before), boil for 1-2 minutes or until the 
solid matter has dissolved. Pour the mixture while still liquid on a dry watch 
glass (CAUTION: the fumes are irritating to the eyes). When the product has 
solidified, remove the liquid by-product (phosphorus oxychloride) by transfer- 
ring the pasty mixture to a pad of several thicknesses of filter paper or to a small 
piece of porous tile. Spread the material until the liquid has been absorbed and 
the residual solid is dry and transfer the 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride to a test 
tube. Add 0.5-1 ml of the alcohol, cork the tube loosely and heat on a boiling 
water bath for 10 minutes: secondary and tertiary alcohols require longer heat- 
ing (up to 30 minutes). Cool the mixture, add 10 ml of 5 per cent (or saturated) 
sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, break up the resulting solid ester with a 

1241 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



stirring rod (alternatively, stir until crystalline) and filter at the pump; wash with 
a little sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, followed by water, and then suck as 
dry as possible. Recrystallise the crude ester from light petroleum (of suitable 
b.p. range) or from aqueous ethanol. Collect the crystals, dry and determine the 
melting point. 

The above procedure may also be carried out in the presence of 1 ml of dry 
pyridine; with some alcohols improved yields may be obtained by this modifica- 
tion. 

/j-NITROBENZOATES 

Alcohols react readily with p-nitrobenzoyl chloride to yield p-nitrobenzoates: 

p-N0 2 -C 6 H 4 -COCl + ROH &gt; p-N0 2 -C 6 H 4 -C0 2 R + HC1 

The melting points of these esters are usually much lower than those of the cor- 
responding 3,5-dinitrobenzoates: their preparation, therefore, offers no advant- 
ages over the latter except for alcohols of high molecular weight and for 
polyhydroxy compounds. The reagent is, however, cheaper than 3,5-dinitro- 
benzoyl chloride; it hydrolyses in the air so that it should either be stored under 
light petroleum or be prepared from the acid, when required, by the phosphorus 
pentachloride method. 

The experimental, technique is similar to that given under 3,5-dinitro- 
benzoates above. 

BENZOATES 

Alcohols react with benzoyl chloride in the presence of pyridine or of sodium 
hydroxide solution to produce esters of benzoic acid: 

Ph-COCl + ROH ► Ph-C0 2 R + HC1 

These derivatives are generally liquids and hence are of little value for character- 
isation; the polyhydric alcohols, on the other hand, afford solid benzoates. Thus 
the benzoates of ethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol and glycerol melt at 73, 58 
and 76 °C respectively 

Mix together 0.5-0.8 ml of the polyhydroxy compound, 5 ml of pyridine and 
2.5 ml of redistilled benzoyl chloride in a 50-ml flask, and heat under reflux for 
30-60 minutes. Add 25 ml of 5 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate solution to 
the cold reaction mixture and cool in ice until the precipitate solidifies. Filter 
and wash with a little water. Recrystallise from dilute ethanol. 

PHENYL- AND 1-NAPHTHYL-URETHANS (PHENYL- AND 1- 
NAPHTHYL-CARBAMATES) 

Both phenyl isocyanate and 1-naphthyl isocyanate (CAUTION: see p. 51) 
react with alcohols to yield phenylurethans and 1-naphthylurethans respect- 
ively: 

Ph-N=C=0 + ROH &gt; Ph-NH-C0 2 R 

C 10 H 7 1 -N=C=O + ROH &gt; C 10 H 7 1 -NH-CO 2 R 

If the alcohol is not anhydrous, reaction also occurs between the water and the 
reagent to produce diphenylurea (m.p. 238 °C) and di-1-naphthylurea (m.p. 
297 °C) respectively, for example: 

2Ph-N=C=0 + H 2 &gt; Ph-NH-CO-NH-Ph + C0 2 

1242 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.6 



The ureas are less soluble than the corresponding urethans, but their separation 
is not always easy. For this reason the urethans are generally prepared from 
alcohols which are insoluble in water and can therefore be easily obtained in the 
anhydrous condition. 

1-Naphthyl isocyanate is usually preferred to phenyl isocyanate for the 
following reasons: (a) it is much less lachrymatory; (b) it is not so readily decom- 
posed by cold water and thus possesses better keeping qualities; and (c) the melt- 
ing points of the 1-naphthylurethans are generally higher than those of the 
corresponding phenylurethans. Furthermore, with primary alcohols, which 
react readily in the cold, only small amounts of the urea are produced and these 
may be removed by taking advantage of the extreme insolubility of di-1- 
naphthylurea in hot ligroin. (See also Section 9.6.8, p. 1251.) 

Place 1 g of the anhydrous alcohol in a dry test tube and add 0.5 ml of 1- 
naphthyl isocyanate* (if the molecular weight is known, use a 10% excess of the 
reagent); insert a loose plug of cotton wool in the mouth of the tube. If no solid 
separates after shaking and standing for 5 minutes, warm on a water bath for 5- 
10 minutes, and then cool in ice. If no solid is now obtained, 'scratch' the sides of 
the tube with a glass rod to induce crystallisation. Extract the solid with 5- 10 ml 
of boiling light petroleum (b.p. 100-120 °C); this rapidly dissolves the 
1-naphthylurethan but not the di-1-naphthylurea. Remove the urea (if any) by 
filtration and allow the hot solution to cool. If the urethan does not crystallise 
out, evaporate the solution to half its original volume, and allow to cool. Collect 
the crystals on a filter, dry and determine the melting point. If the latter is not 
sharp, recrystallise from light petroleum (b.p. 100-120 °C), ethanol, chloroform 
or dichloromethane. 

HYDROGEN 3-NITROPHTHALATES 

3-Nitrophthalic anhydride, a yellow crystalline powder of m.p. 163-164 °C, 
reacts with alcohols to yield monoesters of 3-nitrophthalic acid. Although two 
isomeric esters are theoretically possible, the main product is the 2-ester; traces 
of the isomeric 1 -ester are eliminated during purification. 

C0 2 H 
CO,R 



The reagent must be carefully protected from moisture as it is comparatively 
easily hydra ted to the acid, m.p. 216-218 °C (sealed capillary tube). Dilute 
aqueous solutions of an alcohol should be treated with solid potassium carbon- 
ate and the alcohol layer used for the test. 

Phthalic anhydride reacts similarly (see Section 5.19, p. 809), but the acid 
phthalates are somewhat more difficult to isolate and the melting points are con- 
siderably lower. 

For alcohols of b.p. below 150°C, mix 0.5 g of 3-nitrophthalic anhydride 
(Expt 6.162) and 0.5 ml (0.4 g) of the alcohol in a test tube fitted with a short con- 
denser, and heat under reflux for 10 minutes after the mixture liquefies. For alco- 

* The procedure for phenyl isocyanate is similar, but great care must be taken to protect both the 
reagent and the reaction mixture from moisture. 

1243 




9.E PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



hols boiling above 150°C, use the same quantities of reactants, add 5 ml of dry 
toluene, heat under reflux until all the anhydride has dissolved and then for 20 
minutes more: remove the toluene under reduced pressure (suction with water 
pump). The reaction product usually solidifies upon cooling, particularly upon 
rubbing with a glass rod and standing. If it does not crystallise, extract it with 
dilute sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, wash the extract with ether and 
acidify. Recrystallise from hot water, or from 30 to 40 per cent ethanol or from 
toluene. It may be noted that the m.p. of 3-nitrophthalic acid is 218 °C. 

3,4,5-TRIIODOBENZOATES 

The derivatives enumerated above are unsatisfactory for hydroxy ethers, e.g. the 
mono-ethers of ethyleneglycol ('cellosolves') and the mono-ethers of diethyl- 
eneglycol ('carbitols') (see Table 10.4). Crystalline derivatives of hydroxy ethers 
are readily obtained with 3,4,5-triiodobenzoyl chloride, for example: 

3,4,5-I,C 6 H 2 COCl + HOCH 2 -CH 2 OR ^^&gt; 3,4,5-I,C 6 H 2 -C0 2 CH 2 -CH 2 OR 

Place 0.5 g of 3,4,5-triiodobenzoyl chloride in a small test tube, add 0.25 ml of 
the hydroxy ether and heat the mixture gently over a micro burner until the 
evolution of hydrogen chloride ceases (3-5 minutes). Pour the molten mass into 
10 ml of 20 per cent ethanol to which crushed ice has been added. Some derivat- 
ives solidify instantly; those which separate as oils change to solids in a few 
minutes without further manipulation. Recrystallise from rectified spirit (use 
50% ethanol for esters of methyl and butyl carbitol). 

3,4,5-Triiodobenzoyl chloride is prepared by refluxing 5 g of 3,4,5-triiodoben- 
zoic acid (Expt 6.70) with 10 ml of thionyl chloride for 2 hours. The excess thio- 
nyl chloride is removed by distillation and the residue recrystallised from carbon 
tetrachloride-light petroleum. The acid chloride has m.p. 138 °C; the yield is 
3.8 g. It should be kept in a well-stoppered bottle. 

PSEUDOSACCHARIN ETHERS 

Pseudosaccharin chloride (Expt 6.42) reacts with alcohols to give ethers (0- 
alkyl derivatives of saccharin): 





+ HC1 

COR 

Heat a little pseudosaccharin chloride with excess of the anhydrous alcohol 
in a test tube until hydrogen chloride is no longer evolved. Recrystallise from 
ethanol or other organic solvent. 

With the lower primary alcohols, heating at 100 °C for 10 minutes suffices: for 
higher alcohols, a temperature of 1 25 °C is preferable. Secondary alcohols require 
longer heating at 125 °C. A large excess of alcohol should be used when identify- 
ing the lower alcohols and the excess removed by evaporation; for the higher 
alcohols, it is better to employ an excess of pseudosaccharin chloride and the 
product washed free from the reagent with dilute aqueous alkali. 

The melting points of derivatives of selected aliphatic alcohols and poly- 
hydric alcohols are collected in Tables 10.4 and 10.8 respectively. 

The melting points of some derivatives of aromatic alcohols are collected in 
Table 10.5. 

1244 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS S.6 



9.6.5 CARBOHYDRATES 

The melting points (more accurately termed the decomposition points) of sugars 
and some of their derivatives, e.g. osazones, are not so definite as those of other 
classes of organic compounds: they vary with the rate of heating and the differ- 
ences between individual members are not always large. There are, however, a 
number of reactions and derivatives which will assist in the characterisation of 
the simple sugars. 

OSAZONE FORMATION 

The carbohydrates containing a potential aldehyde or keto group in their cyclic 
form react with one molecular proportion of phenylhydrazine in the cold to 
form the corresponding phenylhydrazones (compare Aldehydes and ketones, 
Section 9.6. 1 3, p. 1 257); these are usually soluble in water and consequently are of 
little value for purposes of separation and identification. If, however, the carbo- 
hydrate is heated in the presence of excess (3-4 moles) of phenylhydrazine, the 
&gt;CHOH in an aldose or the — CH 2 OH in a ketose adjacent to the phenyl- 
hydrazone group is effectively oxidised by one molecule of phenylhydrazine to 
the corresponding carbonyl group, which then reacts with a further molecule of 
phenylhydrazine to give a bisphenylhydrazone or osazone; aniline and ammonia 
are by-products of the reaction.

9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Glucose and fructose (and also mannose) form the same osazone. The 
osazones are usually yellow, well-defined crystalline compounds and are spar- 
ingly soluble in cold water. The characteristic crystalline forms of the osazones 
of the commonly occurring sugars, when examined under the microscope, may 
be employed for their identification (Fig. 9.1); the melting or decomposition

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.E 



points are less satisfactory since these depend to a marked degree on the rate of 
heating. 

Certain carbohydrates (sugars) may be identified by the length of time 
required to form osazones upon treatment with phenylhydrazine under stand- 
ard experimental conditions. Monosaccharides give precipitates at 100 °C 
within 20 minutes. The disaccharides maltose and lactose give no osazone at 
100 °C even after 2 hours, but osazones are obtained on cooling after 10-15 
minutes heating. With sucrose an osazone commences to separate after about 30 
minutes, due to gradual hydrolysis into glucose and fructose, but no osazone is 
produced on cooling after heating for 10-15 minutes. 

Place 0.20 g of the carbohydrate, 0.40 g of pure white phenylhydrazine hydro- 
chloride, e.g. of AnalaR quality; (CAUTION: handle with great care), 0.60 g of 
crystallised sodium acetate and 4.00 ml of water in a dry test tube. (Weigh the 
quantities within an accuracy of 0.01 g.) Stopper the tube loosely with a cork, 
and stand or clamp it upright in a beaker containing boiling water. Note the 
time of immersion and the time when the osazone first separates. Shake the tube 
occasionally (without removing it from the boiling water) in order to prevent 
supersaturation. The precipitate separates quite suddenly: duplicate experi- 
ments should agree within 0.5 minute. Note whether the precipitate is white 
(mannose), yellow or orange yellow, and whether it is crystalline or 'oily'. 

The approximate times of osazone formation in minutes are given in Table 
10.9. The product from mannose is the simple hydrazone and is practically 
white. Arabinose osazone separates first as an oil, while that from galactose is 
highly crystalline. Lactose and maltose give no precipitate from hot solution. 

/j-NITROPHENYLHYDRAZONES 

This reagent has been used in the characterisation of a number of monosacchar- 
ides. 

Heat 0.25 g of the compound with 3 ml of ethanol, add 0.25 g of p-nitro- 
phenylhydrazine and heat the suspension until the reaction appears complete. 
The p-nitrophenylhydrazone soon separates. Filter, preferably after standing 
overnight, wash with a little cold ethanol and then recrystallise from ethanol. 

ACETATES 

Complete acetylation of all the hydroxyl groups is desirable in order to avoid 
mixtures. In some cases, the completely acetylated sugars may be obtained in the 
a- or /?-forms depending upon the catalyst, e.g. zinc chloride or sodium acetate, 
that is employed in the acetylation. The experimental details for acetylation may 
be easily adapted from those already given for a- and ^-glucose penta-acetates 
(Expts 5.106 and 5.107 respectively). 

BENZOATES 

Benzoyl chloride has a limited application as a reagent in the sugar series. 
Details for the benzoylation of D-glucose are given in Expt 5.108. 

TRIMETHYLSILYLATION 

The conversion of monosaccharides and the smaller oligosaccharides (di, tri, 
and tetra-) into their trimethylsilyl derivatives, which are sufficiently volatile to 
be analysed by g.l.c, has greatly simplified the problem of sugar identification. 
The method described in Section 2.31 uses hexamethyldisilazane and chlorotri- 

1247

methylsilane in pyridine solution, and may conveniently be applied to a sample 
size down to 1 mg; the trimethylsilylation reaction is complete within about 20 
minutes.

The melting points of some derivatives of carbohydrates are included in Table 
10.9. 

9.6.6 PHENOLS 

ACETATES 

The acetates of monohydric phenols are usually liquids, but those of di- and tri- 
hydric phenols and also of many substituted phenols are frequently crystalline 
solids. 

Acetates may be prepared by adding acetic anhydride to somewhat dilute 
solutions of compounds containing hydroxyl (or amino) groups in aqueous 
caustic alkalis. The amount of alkali used should suffice to leave the liquid 
slightly basic at the end of the operation, so much ice should be added that a 
little remains unmelted, and the acetic anhydride should be added quickly. 

Dissolve 0.01 mol (or 1 g if the molecular weight is unknown) of the com- 
pound in 5 ml of 3 m sodium hydroxide solution, add 10-20g of crushed ice 
followed by 1.5 g (1.5 ml) of acetic anhydride. Shake the mixture vigorously for 
30-60 seconds. The acetate separates in a practically pure condition either at 
once or after acidification by the addition of a mineral acid. Collect the acetyl 
derivative, and recrystallise it from hot water or from dilute ethanol. 

BENZOATES 

The benzoates of a few phenols (e.g. o-cresol) are liquids. Many phenols do, 
however, yield crystalline benzoyl derivatives: these are useful for purposes of 
characterisation. 

The Schotten-Baumann method of benzoylation with benzoyl chloride in the 
presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide may be used. Full details are given under 
Primary and secondary amines, Section 9.6.2 1 , p. 1 273. Alternatively, dissolve 1 .0 g 
of the phenol in 3 ml of dry pyridine and add 0.5 g of benzoyl chloride. After the 
initial reaction has subsided, warm the mixture over a small flame for a minute 
or two and pour, with vigorous stirring, into 10-15 ml of water. Allow the pre- 
cipitate to settle, decant the supernatant liquid, stir the residue thoroughly with 
5- 10 ml of m sodium carbonate solution, filter and recrystallise from ethanol or 
from light petroleum. 

TOLUENE-p-SULPHONATES 

Toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride reacts readily with phenols to yield toluene-p- 
sulphonates: 

p-Me-C 6 H 4 -S0 2 Cl + ArOH &gt; p-Me-C 6 H 4 -S0 2 OAr + HC1 

Mix l.Og of the phenol with 2.5ml of pyridine, add 2g of toluene-p-sulphonyl 
chloride and heat on a water bath for 1 5 minutes. Pour into 25 ml of cold water 
and stir until the oil solidifies. Filter, wash with cold dilute hydrochloric acid (to 
remove pyridine), with cold dilute sodium hydroxide solution (to remove any 

1248 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS S.S 



phenol present), and then with cold water. Recrystallise from methanol or 
ethanol. 

/j-NITROBENZOATES AND 3,5-DINITROBENZOATES 

Both p-nitrobenzoyl chloride and 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride react with 
phenols, best in pyridine solution, to yield crystalline p-nitrobenzoates and 3,5- 
dinitrobenzoates respectively: 

p-N0 2 -C 6 H 4 -COCl + ArOH ► p-N0 2 -C 6 H 4 -C0 2 Ar + HC1 

3,5-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -COCl + ArOH &gt;■ 3,5-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -C0 2 Ar + HC1 

For properties of these reagents and their preparation from the corresponding 
acids, see under Alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, Section 9.6.4, p. 1241. 

Dissolve 0.5 g of the phenol in 4-5 ml of dry pyridine, add 1 .3 g of 3,5-dinitro- 
benzoyl chloride and reflux for 25-30 minutes. Pour the cold reaction mixture 
into 40 ml of c. 2 M-hydrochloric acid. Decant the supernatant aqueous liquid 
from the precipitated solid or oil and stir it vigorously with about 10 ml of m 
sodium carbonate solution. Filter off the solid derivative and wash it with water. 
Recrystallise from ethanol, dilute ethanol, toluene-acetone or toluene-light 
petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C). 

ARYLOXYACETIC ACIDS 

Phenols, in the presence of alkali, react with chloroacetic acid to give aryloxy- 
acetic acids, which are generally crystalline compounds with sharp melting 
points. (See also Expt 6.110.) 

Ar-O e + Cl-CH 2 -C0 2 e ^&gt; Ar-OCH 2 -COf -^-&gt; Ar-OCH 2 -C0 2 H 

To a mixture of 1.0 g of the compound and 3.5 ml of 33 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution in a test tube, add 2.5 ml of 50 per cent chloroacetic acid 
solution. If necessary, add a little water to dissolve the sodium salt of the phenol. 
Stopper the test tube loosely and heat on a gently boiling water bath for an hour. 
After cooling, dilute with 10 ml of water, acidify to Congo red with dilute hydro- 
chloric acid and extract with 30 ml of ether. Wash the ethereal extract with 10 ml 
of water, and extract the aryloxyacetic acid by shaking with 25 ml of 5 per cent 
sodium carbonate solution. Acidify the sodium carbonate extract (to Congo 
red) with dilute hydrochloric acid, collect the aryloxyacetic acid which separates 
and recrystallise it from water or from aqueous ethanol. 

DIPHENYLURETHANS 

Phenols react with diphenylcarbamoyl chloride to yield diphenylurethans (or 
aryl AT,AT-diphenylcarbamates): 

Ph 2 N-COCl + HOAr ^^&gt; Ph 2 N-CO z Ar + HC1 

The reagent is unsuitable for a number of phenolic acids. 

Dissolve 0.5 g of the phenol in 2.5 ml of pyridine, and add one equivalent of 
diphenylcarbamoyl chloride (or 0.4-0.5 g if the molecular weight is uncertain). 
Reflux the mixture for 30-60 minutes on a boiling-water bath, and then pour 
into about 25 ml of water. Filter the derivative, wash with a little sodium hydro- 
gen carbonate solution and recrystallise from ethanol, toluene, light petroleum 
(b.p. 60-80 °C) or dichloromethane.

9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



1-NAPHTHYLURETHANS 

1-Naphthyl isocyanate reacts smoothly with monohydric, but not with poly- 
hydric, phenols to give 1-naphthylurethans (or AT-1-naphthylcarbamates): 

l-C 10 H 7 N=C=O + ArOH &gt; l-C 10 H 7 NH-CO 2 Ar 

(compare Alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, Section 9.6.4, p. 1242). Some phenols, 
e.g. nitrophenols and halogeno-phenols, react with difficulty with the reagent 
alone; the addition of a few drops of pyridine or 1 drop of an ethereal solution of 
trimethylamine or triethylamine generally results in the rapid formation of the 
urethan. 

Place 0.25 g of the phenol together with an equal weight of 1-naphthyl iso- 
cyanate in a dry test tube closed with a stopper carrying a calcium chloride 
guard-tube. If a spontaneous reaction does not occur, boil the mixture gently for 
2-3 minutes, and cool; if the reaction mixture does not solidify, rub the walls of 
the tube vigorously with a glass rod. If no crystalline solid is obtained, add 2 
drops of dry pyridine or 1 drop of an ethereal solution of triethylamine, and 
warm on a water bath for 5 minutes. Extract contents of the tube with boiling 
light petroleum (b.p. 80-100 °C or 100-120 °C) to separate any insoluble di-1- 
naphthyl urea. Recrystallise the crystals which separate on cooling from the 
same solvent. 

The following alternative method may be used. Dissolve 0.01 mol of the phe- 
nol and 0.01 mol of 1-naphthyl isocyanate in 20 ml of light petroleum (b.p. 60- 
80 °C), add 2 drops of triethylamine (or, less satisfactorily, 2 drops of pyridine), 
reflux for 5 minutes and allow to crystallise. Filter off the crystalline solid 
through a sintered glass funnel. 

2,4-DINITROPHENYL ETHERS 

l-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene reacts with the sodium salts of phenols to yield 
crystalline 2,4-dinitrophenyl ethers: 

2,4-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 Cl + ArONa &gt; (N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -OAr + NaCl 

Dissolve 1 g (or 0.01 mol) of the phenol in a solution of 0.40 g of sodium 
hydroxide in 5 ml of water. Add the resulting solution to 2.0 g of l-chloro-2,4- 
dinitrobenzene dissolved in 30 ml of 95 per cent ethanol; add more ethanol, if 
necessary, to effect solution. Heat the solution under reflux on a water bath until 
the colour (usually red) is discharged and a copious precipitate of sodium chlor- 
ide appears (30-60 minutes). Dilute the reaction mixture with an equal volume 
of water, filter off the precipitated 2,4-dinitrophenyl ether, wash with water and 
recrystallise from ethanol. 

Note. The chlorodinitrobenzene must be handled cautiously (use disposable gloves). If 
any touches the skin, wash it with industrial spirit and then copiously with water. 

PSEUDOSACCHARIN ETHERS 

When pseudosaccharin chloride is heated with an excess of a phenol, O-aryl 
derivatives of saccharin are produced (compare Section 9.6.4, p. 1 244). 

Heat 0.5 g of pseudosaccharin chloride with an excess of the phenol to 125- 
140 °C for 15-20 minutes; hydrogen chloride is evolved. Wash the product with 
dilute sodium hydroxide solution and then with water. Recrystallise the derivat- 
ive from ethanol.

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.E 



BROMO DERIVATIVES 

The presence of the hydroxyl group in phenols facilitates the substitution of the 
nuclear hydrogen atoms by halogen; the number and position of the substituent 
atoms varies with the nature of the phenol. This method is an indirect means of 
identification, as the formation of a substitution derivative is not a characteristic 
reaction of the phenol group but of the benzene nucleus. Phenol reacts with bro- 
mine to give 2,4,6-tribromophenol: 

PhOH + 3Br 2 &gt; 2,4,6-Br 3 C 6 H 3 OH + 3HBr 

Bromo derivatives are often difficult to prepare, particularly in the case of poly- 
hydroxy phenols which oxidise easily. 

Dissolve 1.0 g of the compound in 10- 15 ml of glacial acetic acid, cautiously 
add a solution of 3-4 ml of liquid bromine in 1 0- 1 5 ml of glacial acetic acid until 
the colour of bromine persists and allow the mixture to stand for 15-20 minutes. 
Pour into 50- 100 ml of water, filter off the bromo compound at the pump and 
wash with a little cold water. Recrystallise from dilute ethanol. Alternatively dis- 
solve 1.0 g of the phenol in water, ethanol or acetone and add slowly, with con- 
stant shaking, just sufficient of a bromine solution (prepared by adding 5g of 
bromine to a solution of 7.5 g of potassium bromide in 50 ml of water) to impart 
a yellow colour to the mixture. Allow to stand for 5 minutes. Add about 50 ml of 
water, and shake vigorously to break up any lumps. Filter and wash the bromo 
derivative with a dilute solution of sodium metabisulphite. Recrystallise from 
ethanol or from dilute ethanol. 

The melting points of the derivatives of a number of selected phenols are col- 
lected in Table 10.6. 

9.6.7 ENOLS 

/?-Keto esters and some 1,3-diketones may be characterised by conversion into 
semicarbazones (see Aldehydes and ketones, Section 9.6.13, p. 1258). 

Heating with an equivalent amount of phenylhydrazine often yields charac- 
teristic derivatives. Thus /?-keto esters afford 1-phenylpyrazalones (cf. Expt 
8.15), while 1,3-diketones yield 1-phenylpyrazoles (cf. Expt 8.14). 

Heat a mixture of 0.5 g. of the /?-keto ester and an equivalent amount of 
phenylhydrazine in an oil bath at 100-1 10 °C for 2 hours. Water and alcohol 
vapours are evolved. Cool and recrystallise the product from ethanol. 

For 1,3-diketones, excellent results are obtained by refluxing the reactants in 
ethanolic solution for 2-3 hours; the product separates on cooling. 

The physical properties as well as the melting point? cf the derivatives of a 
number of enols (/?-keto esters and 1,3-diketones) are given in Table 10.7. 

9.6.8 ALIPHATIC HALOGEN COMPOUNDS 

ANILIDES AND 1-NAPHTHALIDES 

The Grignard reagents prepared from alkyl halides react with phenyl isocyanate 
or with 1-naphthyl isocyanate to yield addition products that are converted by 
hydrolysis into anilides and naphthalides respectively: 

Ar-NCO ^^&gt; Ar-N=C(OMgX)R -^&gt; Ar-N=C(OH)R t Ar-NH-COR 



1251 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Phenyl isocyanate is a colourless liquid, b.p. 164 °C or 55°C/13mmHg; its 
vapour is lachrymatory. The liquid reacts readily with water, yielding diphenyl 
urea, m.p. 238 °C, and hence must be protected from atmospheric moisture: 

Ph-NCO + H 2 &gt;■ Ph-NHCONH-Ph + C0 2 

1-Naphthyl isocyanate, b.p. 269-270 °C or 153°C/18mmHg, is not quite so 
irritant and is somewhat more stable towards water (di-1-naphthyl urea has 
m.p. 297 °C). It is therefore to be preferred as a reagent; furthermore the 
1-naphthalides are less soluble than the corresponding anilides. 

In a small dry flask, fitted with a short reflux condenser and a calcium chlor- 
ide guard-tube, place 0.4 g of dry magnesium turnings, a minute crystal of iodine 
and a solution of 1 ml (or 0.01 mol) of the alkyl halide in 10-15 ml of anhydrous 
ether. If the reaction does not start immediately (as indicated by the disappear- 
ance of the iodine colour), warm for a short period in a beaker of warm water; 
allow the reaction to proceed spontaneously, moderating it if necessary by 
immersing the flask in cold water. When the reaction has ceased, decant the 
nearly clear liquid from any solid material into another flask, and fit the reflux 
condenser into it. Add, portionwise, through the condenser a solution of 0.5 ml 
of phenyl or 1-naphthyl isocyanate in 15 ml of anhydrous ether, shaking the 
flask after each addition. Allow the mixture to stand for 10 minutes and then add 
30 ml of m hydrochloric acid dropwise and with vigorous shaking and cooling in 
ice. (Alternatively, pour the reaction mixture cautiously into 20 ml of ice water 
containing 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and shake the mixture well.) 
Transfer to a separatory funnel, shake well, then discard the lower aqueous 
layer. Dry the ethereal solution with a little magnesium sulphate and distil off 
the ether. Recrystallise the residue: methanol, ethanol, light petroleum, ether or 
hot water are suitable recrystallisation solvents. 

ALKYL MERCURY(II) HALIDES 

Grignard reagents, prepared from alkyl halides, react with a mercury(n) halide 
that contains the same halogen as the reagent to form alkyl mercury(n) halides: 

RMgX + HgX 2 &gt;■ RHgX + MgX 2 

The reaction is applicable to primary and secondary halides only; tertiary 
halides do not react. 

Filter the Grignard solution, prepared as in Anilides and 1-naphthalides, 
rapidly through a little glass wool into a test tube containing 4-5 g of mercury(n) 
chloride, bromide or iodide (CAUTION), depending upon the halogen in the 
original alkyl halide. Shake the reaction mixture vigorously for a few minutes 
and then evaporate the ether. Boil the residue with 20 ml of rectified spirit, filter 
the solution, dilute it with 10 ml of distilled water, reheat to dissolve any pre- 
cipitated solid and allow to cool. Recrystallise the alkyl mercury(n) halide from 
dilute ethanol. 

S-ALKYLISOTHIOURONIUM PICRATES 

Alkyl bromides or iodides react with thiourea in ethanolic solution to produce 
S-alkylisothiouronium salts, which yield picrates of sharp melting point:

Alkyl chlorides react slowly and the yield of the derivative is poor. Tertiary 
halides give anomalous results. 

Place a mixture of 0.5 g of finely powdered thiourea (CAUTION), 0.5 g of the 
alkyl halide and 5 ml of ethanol in a test tube or small flask equipped with a 
reflux condenser. Reflux the mixture for a period depending upon the nature of 
the halide: primary alkyl bromides and iodides, 10-20 minutes (according to the 
molecular weight); secondary alkyl bromides or iodides, 2-3 hours; alkyl chlor- 
ides, 3-5 hours*; polymethylene dibromides or di-iodides, 20-50 minutes. Then 
add 0.5 g of picric acid, boil until a clear solution is obtained and cool. If no pre- 
cipitate is obtained, add a few drops of water. Recrystallise the resulting S-alkyl 
isothiouronium picrate from ethanol. 

PICRATES OF ALKYL 2-NAPHTHYL ETHERS 

Alkyl halides react with the sodium or potassium derivative of 2-naphthol in 
alcoholic solution to yield the corresponding alkyl 2-naphthyl ethers (which are 
usually low m.p. solids) and the latter are converted by picric acid into the crys- 
talline picrates: 

RX + 2-C 10 H 7 ONa &gt; 2-C 10 H 7 OR + NaX 

Mix together 1.0 g of pure 2-naphthol and the theoretical quantity of 50 per 
cent potassium hydroxide solution, add 0.5 g of the halide, followed by sufficient 
rectified spirit to produce a clear solution. For alkyl chlorides, the addition of a 
little potassium iodide is recommended. Heat the mixture under reflux for 15 
minutes, and dissolve any potassium halide by the addition of a few drops of 
water. The 2-naphthyl ether usually crystallises out on cooling; if it does not, di- 
lute the solution with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until precipitation 
occurs. Dissolve the 2-naphthyl ether in the minimum volume of hot ethanol 
and add the calculated quantity of picric acid dissolved in hot ethanol. The 
picrate separates out on cooling. Recrystallise it from rectified spirit. 

The 2-naphthyl ethers from methylene halides have m.p. 133 °C, from ethy- 
lene halides 217 °C and trimethylene halides 148 °C. 

Table 10.10, deals with a number of aliphatic halogen compounds together 
with their crystalline derivatives. 

9.6.9 AROMATIC HALOGEN COMPOUNDS 

NITRATION PRODUCTS 

Although no general method of nitration can be given, the following procedure 
is widely applicable. 

* Alkyl chlorides often react more rapidly (50-60 minutes) upon adding 0.5 g of potassium iodide to 
the original reaction mixture, followed by suffcient water or ethanol to produce a clear solution at 
the boiling point. After refluxing, 0.5 g of picric acid is added, etc. 



1253 



9.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Add 1 g of the compound to 4 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid and cau- 
tiously introduce, drop by drop, 4 ml of fuming nitric acid. Warm the mixture on 
a water bath for 10 minutes, then pour it on to 25 g of crushed ice (or 25 ml of 
ice-water). Collect the precipitate by filtration at the pump, and recrystallise it 
from dilute ethanol. 

Twenty per cent oleum may be substituted for the concentrated sulphuric 
acid for compounds which are difficult to nitrate. 

REACTION WITH CHLOROSULPHONIC ACID - SULPH ON AMIDES 

Many aryl halides, either alone or in chloroform solution, when treated with 
excess of chlorosulphonic acid afford the corresponding sulphonyl chlorides in 
good yield (use the experimental details given in Section 9.6.3, p. 1238); the latter 
may be readily converted into the aryl sulphonamides by reaction with concen- 
trated ammonia solution or with solid ammonium carbonate. 

The following give abnormal results when treated with chlorosulphonic acid 
alone, preferably at 50 °C for 30-60 minutes: fluorobenzene (4,4'-difluoro- 
diphenylsulphone, m.p. 98 °C); iodobenzene (4,4'-diiododiphenylsulphone, m.p. 
202 °C); o-dichlorobenzene (3,4,3',4'-tetrachlorodiphenylsulphone, m.p. 176 °C); 
and o-dibromobenzene (3,4,3',4'-tetrabromodiphenylsulphone, m.p. 176— 
177 °C). The resulting sulphones may be crystallised from glacial acetic acid, 
toluene or ethanol, and are satisfactory for identification of the original aryl 
halide. In some cases sulphones accompany the sulphonyl chloride; they are 
readily separated from the final sulphonamide by their insolubility in cold 6 m 
sodium hydroxide solution; the sulphonamides dissolve readily and are repreci- 
pitated by 6 m hydrochloric acid. 

OXIDATION OF SIDE CHAINS 

The oxidation of halogenated toluenes and similar compounds and of com- 
pounds with side chains of the type — CH 2 C1 and — CH 2 OH proceeds compar- 
atively smoothly with alkaline permanganate solution (for experimental details, 
see under Aromatic hydrocarbons, Section 9.6.3, p. 1239 and also Expt 6.149). The 
resulting acid may be identified by a m.p. determination and by the preparation 
of suitable derivatives (see Section 9.6.15, p. 1261). 

PICRATES 

Some halogen derivatives of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons form picrates 
(for experimental details, see under Aromatic hydrocarbons, Section 9.6.3, p. 
1240), for example, 1-chloro naphthalene (m.p. 137°C), 1-bromonaphthalene 
(m.p. 134°C) and 2-bromonaphthalene (m.p. 86 °C). 

The properties of a number of aromatic halogen compounds together with 
the melting points of their derivatives are collected in Table 10.11. 

9.6.10 ALIPHATIC ETHERS 

The low reactivity of aliphatic ethers renders the problem of the preparation of 
suitable crystalline derivatives a somewhat difficult one. There are, however, two 
reactions based upon the cleavage of the ethers which are useful for characterisa- 
tion. 



1254 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.6 



REACTION WITH 3,5-DINITROBENZOYL CHLORIDE 

Ethers undergo cleavage with 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride in the presence of zinc 
chloride: 

ROR + (N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 C0C1 ^^&gt; (N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H,C0 2 R + RC1 

The resulting alkyl 3,5-dinitrobenzoate may be employed for the characterisa- 
tion of the ether. The method is only applicable to symmetrical ethers; a mixed 
aliphatic ether R'OR 2 would yield a mixture of solid esters. 

Add 1 ml of the ether to 0.1—0.15 g of finely powdered anhydrous zinc chloride 
and 0.5 g of pure 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride (Section 9.6.4, p. 1241) contained in 
a test tube; attach a small water condenser and reflux gently for 1 hour. Treat the 
reaction product with 10 ml of 0.75 m sodium carbonate solution, heat and stir 
the mixture for 1 minute upon a boiling water bath, allow to cool and filter at the 
pump. Wash the precipitate with 5 ml of 0.75 m sodium carbonate solution and 
twice with 5 ml of ether. Dry on a porous tile or upon a pad of filter paper. 
Transfer the crude ester to a test tube and boil it with 10 ml of dichloro- 
methane; filter the hot solution, if necessary. If the ester does not separate on 
cooling, evaporate to dryness on a water bath, and recrystallise the residue from 
2-3 ml of either aqueous ethanol or light petroleum. Determine the melting 
point of the resulting 3,5-dinitrobenzoate (see Table 10.4). 

CLEAVAGE OF ETHERS WITH HYDRIODIC ACID 

Aliphatic ethers suffer fission when boiled with constant boiling point hydriodic 
acid. (See also Section 5.4.6, p. 550.) 

R'OR 2 + 2HI ► R l l + R 2 I + H 2 

If the ether is a simple one (R 1 =R 2 ), the identification of the resulting alkyl 
iodide presents no difficulties. If, however, it is a mixed alphatic ether, the 
separation of the two alkyl iodides by fractional distillation is generally difficult 
unless R 1 and R 2 differ considerably in molecular weight and sufficient material 
is available. 

Reflux 1 ml of the ether with 5 ml of freshly distilled, constant boiling point 
hydriodic acid (Section 4.2.32, p. 436), b.p. 126-128 °C, for 2-3 hours. Add 10 ml 
of water, distil and collect about 7 ml of liquid. Decolourise the distillate by the 
addition of a little sodium metabisulphite, and separate the two layers by means 
of a dropper pipette. Determine the b.p. of the resulting iodide by the Siwoloboff 
method (Section 2.34) and prepare a crystalline derivative (Section 9.6.8, p. 125 1). 

The physical properties of a number of aliphatic ethers, including cyclic 
ethers, are collected in Table 10.12. 

9.6.11 AROMATIC ETHERS 

Commonly encountered purely aromatic ethers (e.g. diphenyl ether) are limited 
in number; most aromatic ethers are of the mixed aliphatic-aromatic type. The 
following procedures may be used for their characterisation. 

CLEAVAGE WITH A HYDRIODIC ACID 

Aromatic ethers undergo fisson when heated with constant boiling point hydri- 
odic acid: 

1255 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



ArOR + HI ► ArOH + RI 

The cleavage products are a phenol and an alkyl iodide, which will serve to char- 
acterise the ether (see also Section 6.9.4, p. 988). 

Experimental details can easily be adapted from those given under Aliphatic 
ethers, Section 9.6.10, p. 1254. 

To isolate the phenol, treat the residue in the flask with aqueous sodium car- 
bonate until alkaline and extract the mixture with ether. Wash the ethereal 
extract with saturated aqueous sodium carbonate, and then with 2 m sodium 
hydroxide solution. Acidify the sodium hydroxide solution (to Congo red paper) 
and extract the liberated phenol with ether. Characterise the phenol as in 
Section 9.6.6, p. 1248. 

PICRATES 

Ethers of many polynuclear aromatic systems are conveniently characterised as 
their picrates prepared by the method described for the corresponding derivates 
in Aromatic hydrocarbons, Section 9.6.3, p. 1238. 

DERIVATIVES BY NUCLEAR SUBSTITUTION 

Nitration. These may generally be prepared as detailed under Aromatic hydro- 
carbons, Section 9.6.3, p. 1238; the following experimental procedure for anisole 
may be regarded as typical. Add 0.5 g of anisole to a mixture of equal volumes of 
concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid keeping the temperat- 
ure below 25 °C by cooling in an ice bath. Finally warm to 40 °C until dilution of 
a small portion with water gives a solid product. Pour the whole of the reaction 
mixture into water; collect the resulting 2,4-dinitroanisole and recrystallise from 
ethanol. 

Bromination. These may be prepared as described under Phenols, Section 9.6.6, 
p. 1251, using glacial acetic acid as solvent. In some cases dichloromethane is a 
satisfactory solvent; the dichloromethane is separated by distillation and the 
residue is recrystallised from dilute ethanol. 

Formation of suiphonamides. These may be prepared as described for Aromatic 
hydrocarbons, Section 9.6.3, p. 1238. 

OXIDATION OF SIDE CHAINS 

General conditions for the oxidation of an alkyl side chain attached to an aro- 
matic ring are given under Aromatic hydrocarbons, Section 9.6.3, p. 1239. The 
following procedure for the oxidation of p-cresyl methyl ether to anisic acid is 
illustrative. 

Prepare a solution of 6 g of potassium permanganate in a mixture of 20 ml of 
5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 150 ml of water, add 2.0 g of p-cresyl 
methyl ether and heat under reflux for 2-3 hours. If any permanganate remains 
at the end of this period, destroy it by the addition of a few drops of ethanol. 
Remove the precipitated manganese dioxide by filtration at the pump, evapor- 
ate the filtrate to a volume of 25-30 ml and acidify it (to Congo red) with dilute 
sulphuric acid. Anisic acid, m.p. 183-1 84 °C, crystallises out on cooling. 

Table 10.13 contains data referring to a number of selected aromatic ethers. 



1256 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.E 



9.6.12 ACETALS 

Acetals may be characterised by reference to the alcohol and aldehyde (or 
ketone if a ketal) which they yield readily when hydrolysed in dilute acid solu- 
tion (e.g. with 3-5% acid): 

H® 

R'-CH(OR 2 ) 2 + H 2 -=— &gt; R'-CHO + 2R 2 OH 

The rate of hydrolysis depends upon the solubility of the acetal in the hydrolysis 
medium. Acetals of low molecular weight are completely hydrolysed by reflux- 
ing for 5-10 minutes; those of higher molecular weight, and therefore of low 
solubility, may require 30-60 minutes, but the rate of hydrolysis may be in- 
creased by the addition of dioxane which increases the solubility of the acetal. 

The experimental procedure to be followed depends upon the products of 
hydrolysis. If the alcohol and aldehyde are both soluble in water, the reaction 
product is divided into two parts. One portion is used for the characterisation of 
the aldehyde by the preparation of a suitable derivative (e.g. the 2,4-dinitro- 
phenylhydrazone, semicarbazone or dimethone, see Aldehydes and ketones, 
Section 9.6.13, below). The other portion is employed for the preparation of a 
3,5-dinitrobenzoate, etc. (see Alcohols and polyhydric alcohols, Section 9.6.4, p. 
1241): it is advisable first to concentrate the alcohol by distillation or to attempt 
to salt out the alcohol by the addition of solid potassium carbonate. If one of the 
hydrolysis products is insoluble in the reaction mixture, it is separated and char- 
acterised. If both the aldehyde and the alcohol are insoluble, they are removed 
from the aqueous layer; separation is generally most simply effected with sodium 
metabisulphite solution (compare Expt 5.82), but fractional distillation may 
sometimes be employed. 

The formulae and physical properties of a number of common acetals are col- 
lected in Table 10.14. 

9.6.13 ALDEHYDES AND KETONES 

2,4-DINITROPHENYLHYDRAZONES 

Small quantities may be prepared with the class reagent described on p. 1218. The 
following procedure is generally more satisfactory. 

Suspend 0.25 g of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in 5 ml of methanol and add 
0.4-0.5 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid cautiously. Filter the warm solution 
and add a solution of 0.1-0.2 g of the carbonyl compound in a small volume of 
methanol or of ether. If no solid separates within 10 minutes, dilute the solution 
carefully with m sulphuric acid. Collect the solid by suction filtration and wash it 
with a little aqueous methanol. Recrystallise the derivative from ethanol, dilute 
ethanol, ethyl acetate, acetic acid, dioxane, nitromethane, nitrobenzene or 
xylene. 

Alternatively, to the clear solution obtained by warming 0.5 g of 2,4-dinitro- 
phenylhydrazine, 1 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 8-10 ml of ethanol, 
add 0.25 g of the carbonyl compound and heat just to boiling. Allow to cool to 
room temperature, filter off the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone and recrystallise it 
from ethanol or glacial acetic acid. 

The following reagent, a 0.25 m solution of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, may be 
used for the preparation of derivatives of keto compounds. Dissolve 25 g of 2,4- 

1257 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



dinitrophenylhydrazine in 300 ml of 85 per cent phosphoric acid in a 600-ml 
beaker on a steam bath, dilute the solution with 200 ml of 95 per cent ethanol, 
allow to stand and filter through a sintered glass funnel. It must be emphasised 
that this reagent is not suitable for the routine detection of carbonyl compounds 
since it also gives a precipitate in the cold with certain amines, esters and other 
compounds: if, however, a dilute solution of the ketonic compound in ethanol is 
treated with a few drops of the reagent and the mixture diluted with water and 
heated, the precipitate produced with non-ketonic compounds generally dis- 
solves. 

For the preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazones, dissolve the carbonyl 
compound (say, 0.5 g) in 5 ml of ethanol and add the calculated volume of the 
reagent. If a precipitate does not form immediately, dilute with a little water. 
Collect the derivative and recrystallise it as above. 

/j-NITROPHENYLHYDRAZONES 

Reflux a mixture of 0.5 g of p-nitrophenylhydrazine, 0.5 g of the aldehyde (or 
ketone), 10-15 ml of ethanol and 2 drops of glacial acetic acid for 10 minutes. 
Add more ethanol if the boiling solution is not homogeneous. Cool the clear 
solution, filter off the p-nitrophenylhydrazone and recrystallise it from ethanol 
or acetic acid. 

Alternatively, dissolve approximately equivalent amounts of the aldehyde (or 
ketone) and the solid reagent in the minimum volume of cold glacial acetic acid, 
and reflux for 1 5 minutes. The p-nitrophenylhydrazone separates on cooling or 
upon careful dilution with water. 

PHENYLHYDRAZONES 

Dissolve 0.5 g of colourless phenylhydrazine hydrochloride (CAUTION) and 
0.8 g of sodium acetate in 5 ml of water, and add a solution of 0.2-0.4 g of the 
aldehyde (or ketone) in a little ethanol (free from aldehydes and ketones). Shake 
the mixture until a clear solution is obtained and add a little more ethanol, if 
necessary. Warm on a water bath for 10-15 minutes and cool. Filter off the crys- 
talline derivative, and recrystallise it from dilute ethanol or water; sometimes 
benzene or light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) may be used. 

SEMICARBAZONES 

Dissolve 1 g of semicarbazide hydrochloride and 1.5 g of crystallised sodium 
acetate in 8-10 ml of water, add 0.5 g of the aldehyde or ketone and shake. If the 
mixture is turbid, add alcohol (acetone-free) or water until a clear solution is 
obtained; shake the mixture for a few minutes and allow to stand. Usually the 
semicarbazone crystallises from the cold solution on standing, the time varying 
from a few minutes to several hours. The reaction may be accelerated, if neces- 
sary, by warming the mixture on a water bath for a few minutes and then cooling 
in ice- water. Filter off the crystals, wash with a little cold water and recrystallise 
from water or from methanol or ethanol either alone or diluted with water. 

Note. When semicarbazide is heated in the absence of a carbonyl compound for long 
periods, condensation to biurea, NH 2 CONH-NHCONH 2 , m.p. 247-250 °C (decomp.), 
may result; occasionally this substance may be produced in the normal preparation of a 
semicarbazone that forms slowly. Biurea is sparingly soluble in alcohol and soluble in hot 
water, whereas semicarbazones with melting points in the same range are insoluble in 
water: this enables it to be readily distinguished from a semicarbazone. 

1258 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.E 



OXIMES 

The method given for semicarbazones (above) may be employed: use 1 g of 
hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 2g of crystallised sodium acetate and 0.5 g of the 
aldehyde or ketone. It is usually advisable to warm on a water bath for 10 
minutes. 

For water-insoluble aldehydes or ketones, the following alternative pro- 
cedure may be used. Reflux a mixture of 0.5 g of the aldehyde or ketone, 0.5 g of 
hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 5 ml of ethanol and 0.5 ml of pyridine on a water 
bath for 15-60 minutes. Remove the ethanol either by distillation (water bath) 
or by evaporation of the hot solution in a stream of air (water pump). Add 5 ml 
of water to the cooled residue, cool in an ice bath and stir until the oxime crystal- 
lises. Filter off the solid, wash it with a little water and dry. Recrystallise from 
ethanol (95% or more dilute), benzene or benzene-light petroleum (b.p. 60- 
80 °C). 

Note. All aldehydes, and also those ketones which have two different groups attached to 
the carbonyl grouping, are capable of yielding two stereoisomeric oximes, hydrazones or 
semicarbazones. As a general rule, however, one of the stereoisomerides is formed in 
much greater amount than the other, and no doubt therefore arises as to the purity of the 
ketonic compound under investigation; occasionally a mixture of stereoisomerides is 
obtained, which may be difficult to separate by recrystallisation. The formation, there- 
fore, of one of the above derivatives having indefinite melting point and obvious hetero- 
geneity does not necessarily imply the presence of an impure ketonic substance. 

DIMEDONE DERIVATIVES (aldehydes only) 

Dimedone (5,5-dimethylcyclohexane-l,3-dione) in saturated aqueous solution 
or in 10 per cent alcohol solution gives crystalline derivatives (2) with aldehydes, 
but not with ketones. The reaction is: 




The condensation products (conveniently called alkylidene dimethones) are 
almost insoluble in water, but can be crystallised from dilute ethanol. Dimedone 
is therefore a good reagent for the detection and characterisation of aldehydes. 



1259 



9.S PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The alkylidene dimethone (2) upon boiling with glacial acetic acid, acetic 
anhydride, hydrochloric acid and other reagents frequently loses water and 
passes into the anhydride, or dimethone anhydride (3) (a substituted octahydro- 
xanthene) which often serves as another derivative. The derivatives (2) are 
soluble in dilute alkali and the resulting solutions give colorations with ferric 
chloride solution; on the other hand, the anhydrides (3) are insoluble in dilute 
alkali and hence can easily be distinguished from the alkylidene dimethones (2). 

Add 0. 1 g of the aldehyde in 5 ml of 50 per cent ethanol to 2 ml of a 1 per cent 
or saturated ethanolic solution of dimedone. If a precipitate does not form im- 
mediately, warm for 5 minutes; if the solution is still clear at the end of this 
period, add hot water until the mixture is just cloudy and cool to about 5 °C. 
Collect the crystalline derivative and recrystallise it from methanol-water or 
ethanol-water. 

To prepare the anhydride, boil a solution of 0. 1 g of the dimethone derivative 
(2) in 5 ml of 80 per cent ethanol to which 1 drop of concentrated hydrochloric 
acid has been added, for 5 minutes, then add hot water until the mixture is just 
turbid, cool and collect the anhydride by filtration. Recrystallise it from dilute 
methanol. 

BENZYLIDENE DERIVATIVES 

Compounds containing the ketomethylene group ( — CH 2 - CO — ) react with 
benzaldehyde to yield benzylidene derivatives: 

R'-COCH 2 -R 2 + Ph-CHO &gt;■ R-COC(=CH-Ph)R 2 + H 2 

R'-CHj-COCH^R 2 + 2Ph-CHO &gt;■ 

R 1 -C(=CH-Ph)-COC(=CH-Ph)R 2 + 2H 2 

Dissolve 1 g of the ketomethylene compound and 1.1 g or 2.2 g of pure benzalde- 
hyde (according as to whether the compound may be regarded as R-COCH 2 - R 
or as R-CH 2 &gt; CO &gt; CH 2 'R) in about 10 ml of rectified (or industrial) spirit, add 
0.5 ml of 5 m sodium hydroxide solution, shake and allow the mixture to stand 
for about an hour at room temperature. The benzylidene derivative usually crys- 
tallises out or will do so upon 'scratching' the walls of the vessel with a glass rod. 
Filter off the solid, wash it with a little cold ethanol and recrystallise it from 
absolute ethanol. (See also Expt 6.135.) 

AZINES 

Aldehydes react with hydrazine to yield azines: the reaction cannot usually be 
arrested at the hydrazone stage. This reaction may be illustrated by the prepara- 
tion of benzylideneazine from benzaldehyde: 

2Ph-CHO + N 2 H 4 -H 2 S0 4 ° q H "^ &gt; Ph-CH=N-N=CH-Ph + 2H 2 

Stir a mixture of 2.4 g of powdered hydrazine sulphate, 1 8 ml of water and 2.4 ml 
of concentrated aqueous ammonia (d 0.88), and add 4.6 g (4.4 ml) of benzalde- 
hyde (free from benzoic acid) dropwise, with stirring, over a period of 30-60 
minutes. Stir the mixture for a further hour, collect the solid by suction filtration 
and wash it with water. Recrystallise from 8 ml of rectified spirit. The yield of 
benzylideneazine (yellow needles), m.p. 92-93 °C, is 3.6 g. 

The physical constants of the various derivatives of aliphatic and aromatic 
aldehydes and ketones are given in Tables 10.15, 10.16, 10.17 and 10.18.

9.6.14 QUINONES 

REDUCTION TO THE HYDROQUINONE 

Dissolve, or suspend, 0.5 g of the quinone in 5 ml of ether or benzene and shake 
vigorously with a solution of 1.0 g of sodium dithionite (Na 2 S 2 4 ) in 10 ml of m 
sodium hydroxide until the colour of the quinone has disappeared. Separate the 
alkaline solution of the hydroquinone, cool it in ice and acidify with concen- 
trated hydrochloric acid. Collect the product (extract with ether, if necessary) 
and recrystallise it from ethanol or water. 

REDUCTIVE ACETYLATION 

Suspend 0.5 g of the quinone in 2.5 ml of pure acetic anhydride, and add 0.5 g of 
zinc powder and 0.1 g of powdered, anhydrous sodium acetate. Warm the mix- 
ture gently until the colour of the quinone has largely disappeared and then boil 
for 1 minute. Add 2 ml of glacial acetic acid and boil again to dissolve the prod- 
uct and part of the precipitated zinc acetate. Decant the hot solution from the 
zinc acetate and zinc, and wash the residue with 3-4 ml of hot glacial acetic acid. 
Combine the solutions, heat to boiling, carefully add sufficient water to hydro- 
lyse the acetic anhydride and to produce a turbidity. Cool the mixture in ice, 
filter off the diacetate of the hydroquinone and recrystallise it from dilute etha- 
nol or from light petroleum. 

THIELE ACETYLATION 

Quinones, when treated with acetic anhydride in the presence of perchloric acid 
or of concentrated sulphuric acid (strong acid catalyst), undergo simultaneous 
reductive acetylation and substitution to yield triacetoxy derivatives, e.g. benzo- 
quinone gives 1,2,4-triacetoxybenzene (cf. Expt 6.130). 

Add 0.1 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid or of 72 per cent perchloric acid 
cautiously to a cold solution of 0.01 mol (or 1.0 g) of the quinone in 3-5 ml of 
acetic anhydride. Do not permit the temperature to rise above 50 °C. Allow to 
stand for 1 5-30 minutes and pour into 1 5 ml of water. Collect the precipitated 
solid and recrystallise it from ethanol. 

SEMICARBAZONES 

The preparation of these derivatives is described on p. 1258. 

QUINOXALINES FROM o-QUINONES 

The preparation of these derivatives is described in Expt 8.44. 

The melting points of the derivatives of a selection of quinones are collected 
in Table 10.19. 

9.6.15 CARB0XYLIC ACIDS 

AMIDES, ANILIDES AND /j-TOLUIDIDES 

The dry acid is first converted by excess of thionyl chloride into the acid chlor- 
ide: 

R-C0 2 H + SOCl 2 &gt;■ R-COC1 + S0 2 + HC1 

The by-products are both gaseous and the excess of thionyl chloride (b.p. 78 °C) 

1261 



9.E PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



may be readily removed by distillation. Interaction of the acid chloride with 
ammonia solution, aniline or p-toluidine yields the amide, anilide or p-toluidide 
respectively: 

R-COC1 + 2NH 3 &gt; R-CONH 2 + NH 4 C1 

R^COCl + 2R 2 NH 2 &gt; R^CONHR 2 + R 2 NH 2 ,HC1 

Place 0.5-1.0g of the dry acid (finely powdered if it is a solid) into a 25-ml 
flask fitted with a reflux condenser, add 2.5-5.0 ml of redistilled thionyl chloride 
and reflux gently for 30 minutes; it is advisable to place a plug of cotton wool* in 
the top of the condenser to exclude moisture. Rearrange the condenser and distil 
off the excess of thionyl chloridef (b.p. 78 °C). The residue in the flask consists of 
the acid chloride and can be converted into any of the derivatives given below. 

Amides. Treat the acid chloride cautiously with about 20 parts of concentrated 
ammonia solution (d 0.88) and warm for a few moments. If no solid separates on 
cooling, evaporate to dryness on a water bath. Recrystallise the crude amide 
from water or dilute ethanol. 

Alternatively stir the acid chloride with an equivalent weight of ammonium 
acetate in 10 ml of acetone at room temperature for one hour, filter the mixture 
and evaporate the acetone, and crystallise the residual amide from water or from 
dilute ethanol. 

Anilides. Dilute the acid chloride with 5 ml of pure ether (or benzene), and add a 
solution of 2g of pure aniline in 15-20 ml of the same solvent until the odour of 
the acid chloride has disappeared; excess of aniline is not harmful. Shake with 
excess of dilute hydrochloric acid to remove aniline and its salts, wash the 
ethereal (or benzene) layer with 3-5 ml of water and evaporate the solvent 
(CAUTION). Recrystallise the anilide from water, dilute ethanol or toluene- 
light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C). 

p-Bromoanilides are similarly prepared with p-bromoaniline. 

/7-Toluidides. Proceed as under Anilides, but substitute p-toluidine for aniline. 

Anilides and p-toluidides may also be prepared directly from the acids% by heating 
them with aniline or p-toluidine respectively: 

R^COjH + R 2 NH 2 &gt; R^CONHR 2 + H 2 

Place 1 .0 g of the monobasic acid and 2 g of aniline or p-toluidine in a dry test 
tube, attach a short air condenser and heat the mixture in an oil bath at 140- 
160 °C for 2 hours: do not reflux too vigorously an acid that boils below this 
temperature range and only allow steam to escape from the top of the con- 
denser. For a sodium salt, use the proportions of 1 g of salt to 1.5 g of the base. If 
the acid is dibasic, employ double the quantity of amine and a reaction temper- 

* This is more convenient than the conventional calcium chloride guard-tube and possesses the 

advantages of cheapness and hence can easily be renewed for each experiment. 

t If the boiling point of the acid chloride is too near that of thionyl chloride to render separation by 

distillation practicable, the excess of the reagent can be destroyed by the addition of pure formic 

acid: 

HC0 2 H + SOCI 2 &gt; CO + S0 2 + 2HCI 

% Alternatively, the alkali metal salts of the acids may be heated with the hydrochloride of the 
appropriate base. 

1262 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 16 



ature of 1 80-200 °C: incidentally, this procedure is recommended for dibasic 
acids since the latter frequently give anhydrides with thionyl chloride. Powder 
the cold reaction mixture, triturate it with 20-30 ml of 10 per cent hydrochloric 
acid* and recrystallise from dilute ethanol. 

/j-BROMOPHENACYL ESTERS 

p-Bromophenacyl bromide reacts with the alkali metal salts of acids to form 
crystalline p-bromophenacyl esters: 

R-C0 2 Na + BrCH 2 -COC 6 H 4 Br(/&gt;) ^^&gt; R.C0 2 CH 2 -COC 6 H 4 Br(/&gt;) 

Dissolve or suspend 0.5 g of the acid in 5 ml of water in a small conical flask, 
add a drop or two of phenolphthalein indicator, and then 4-5 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution until the acid is just neutralised. Add a few drops of very 
dilute hydrochloric acid so that the final solution is faintly acid (litmus).f 
Introduce 0.5 g of p-bromophenacyl bromide (m.p. 109 °C) dissolved in 5 ml of 
rectified (or industrial) spirit, and heat the mixture under reflux for 1 hour: if the 
mixture is not homogeneous at the boiling point or a solid separates out, add 
just sufficient ethanol to produce homogeneity. (Di- and tri-basic acids require 
proportionately larger amounts of the reagent and longer refluxing periods.) 
Allow the solution to cool, filter the separated crystals at the pump, wash with a 
little alcohol and then with water. Recrystallise from dilute ethanol: dissolve the 
solid in hot ethanol, add hot water until a turbidity just results, clear the latter 
with a few drops of ethanol and allow to cool. Acetone may sometimes be 
employed for recrystallisation. 

/j-NITROBENZYL ESTERS 

p-Nitrobenzyl bromide (m.p. 100 °C) reacts with the alkali metal salts of acids to 
give p-nitrobenzyl esters: 

R-CO,Na + BrCH 2 -C 6 H 4 -NO,(p) ~-^^&gt; R-C0 2 CH 2 -C 6 H 4 -N0 2 (p) 

It is important that the solution of the sodium salt be faintly acid in order that 
the formation of coloured by-products in the subsequent reaction may be pre- 
vented. If the molecular weight of the monobasic acid is known, it is desirable to 
employ a slight excess of the sodium salt, since excess of the latter is more easily 
removed than the unchanged reagent. 

Use the procedure given above for p-bromophenacyl esters. If the ester does 
not crystallise out on cooling, reheat the reaction mixture, and add small por- 
tions of hot water to the point of incipient cloudiness and allow to cool. 

/j-PHENYLPHENACYL ESTERS 

p-Phenylphenacyl bromide reacts with soluble salts of organic acids to yield 
crystalline p-phenylphenacyl esters. 

* When the derivative is appreciably soluble in ether, the following alternative procedure may be 
employed. Dissolve the cold reaction mixture in about 50 ml of ether, wash it with 20-30 ml of 10 per 
cent hydrochloric acid (to remove the excess of base), followed by 20 ml of 10 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution, separate the ether layer and evaporate the solvent (CAUTION). Recrystallise 
the residue from dilute ethanol. 

t If the sodium salt of the acid is available, dissolve 0.5g in 5ml of water, add a solution of 0.5g of 
the reagent in 5 ml of ethanol and proceed as detailed in the text after just acidifying (litmus) with 
dilute hydrochloric acid. 

1263 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



R-C0 2 Na + BrCH 2 -COC 6 H 4 -Ph(p) -^&gt; R-C0 2 CH,-CO-C 6 H 4 -Ph(p) 

The procedure is similar to that given under p-Bromophenacyl esters and p- 
Nitrobenzyl esters above. Add a weighed amount of acid (0.005 mol) to 5 ml of 
water in a small conical flask and neutralise it with 0.5 m sodium carbonate or 
m sodium hydroxide. The final solution should be faintly acid to litmus (add 
more of the organic acid or a few drops of dilute hydrochloric acid); unless this 
precaution is taken, coloured by-products are formed which are very difficult to 
remove. (If the alkali metal salt is available, dissolve 0.005 mol in 5 ml of water, 
and render the solution just acid to litmus by the addition of dilute hydrochloric 
acid.) Introduce 10 ml of ethanol, and if the salt of the organic acid is not thrown 
out of solution, add 0.005 mol of p-phenylphenacyl bromide. Dibasic and tri- 
basic acids will require 0.01 and 0.015 mol respectively. Reflux the mixture for 
periods of up to 1, 2 or 3 hours according to the basicity of the acid. If the salt of 
the organic acid is precipitated by the ethanol, add more water until the salt dis- 
solves. Some of the esters are sparingly soluble in the reaction mixture and crys- 
tallise from the boiling solution; in most cases, however, crystal formation does 
not occur until the mixture is cooled. In some instances it may be necessary to 
concentrate the solution before crystallisation occurs. Recrystallise the crude p- 
phenylphenacyl ester from ethanol, dilute ethanol, acetone or toluene. 

Certain dibasic acids, of which the sodium or potassium salts are sparingly 
soluble in dilute ethanol, cause difficulty; these should be neutralised with ethyl- 
amine solution. 

5-BENZYLISOTHIOURONIUM SALTS 

S-Benzylisothiouronium chloride reacts with the alkali metal salts of organic 
acids to produce crystalline S-benzylisothiouronium salts: 



Ph-CH,-S-CC 

^NH 2

Cl e + R-COjNa* -^ 



^NH 2 

Ph-CH 2 -S-CC 

^NH 2 



R-COf 



It is important not to allow the reaction mixture to become appreciably alkaline, 
since the free base then decomposes rapidly yielding phenylmethanethiol, which 
has an unpleasant odour. 

Dissolve (or suspend) 0.25 g of the acid in 5 ml of warm water, add a drop or 
two of phenolphthalein indicator and neutralise carefully with c. m sodium 
hydroxide solution. Then add 2-3 drops of c. 0.1 m hydrochloric acid to ensure 
that the solution is almost neutral (pale pink colour). (Under alkaline conditions 
the reagent tends to decompose to produce the evil-smelling phenylmethane- 
thiol.) If the sodium salt is available, dissolve 0.25 g in 5 ml of water and add 2 
drops of c. 0.1 m hydrochloric acid. Introduce a solution of 1 g of S-benzyliso- 
thiouronium chloride in 5 ml of water, and cool in ice until precipitation is com- 
plete. Recrystallise the crude derivative from dilute ethanol or from hot water. 

With some acids (e.g. succinic acid and sulphanilic acid) more satisfactory re- 
sults are obtained by reversing the order of mixing, i.e. by adding the solution of 
the sodium salt of the acid to the reagent. In view of the proximity of the melting 
points of the derivatives of many acids, the mixed m.p. test (Section 2.33) should 
be applied. 



1264 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.6 



ANHYDRIDES 

1,2-Dicarboxylic acids are readily converted into cyclic anhydrides when heated 
alone or in acetic anhydride. Heat 0.5 g of the acid in 2-3 ml of refluxing acetic 
anhydride for 30 minutes. Remove most of the excess reagent by distillation and 
crystallise the residual cyclic anhydride from chloroform or toluene. The melt- 
ing points of aliphatic and aromatic anhydrides are to be found in Tables 10.23 
and 10.24 respectively. For conversion of the anhydrides into anilic acids see 
Section 9.6.16, below. 

FUSION WITH SODA-LIME 

An additional useful test for aromatic carboxylic acids is to distil the acid or its 
sodium salt with soda-lime. Heat 0.5 g of the acid or its sodium salt with 0.5 g of 
soda-lime in an ignition tube to make certain that there is no danger of explo- 
sion. Then grind together 0.5 g of the acid with 3 g of soda-lime, place the mix- 
ture in a Pyrex test tube and cover it with an equal bulk of soda-lime. Fit a wide 
delivery tube dipping into an empty test tube. Clamp the tube near the mouth. 
Heat the soda-lime first and then the mixture gradually to a dull-red heat. 
Examine the product: this may consist of aromatic hydrocarbons or derivatives, 
e.g. phenol from salicylic acid, anisole from anisic acid, toluene from toluic acid, 
etc. 

The melting points of the derivatives of aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic 
acids are collected in Tables 10.20 and 10.21. 

9.6.16 CARBOXYLIC ACID CHLORIDES AND ANHYDRIDES 

HYDROLYSIS TO THE ACIDS 

A general procedure is to hydrolyse the acid chloride (or anhydride) by warming 
with dilute alkali and acidifying the resulting solution with dilute hydrochloric 
acid to Congo red. If the acid is sparingly soluble, filter it off and characterise it 
in the usual way. If no precipitate of carboxylic acid is obtained, adjust the pH of 
the solution to neutrality to phenolphthalein and evaporate to dryness. Use the 
mixture of the sodium salt of the acid and sodium chloride thus obtained for the 
preparation of a suitable derivative (e.g. the p-bromophenacyl ester). 

CONVERSION INTO ANILIDES 

Acid chlorides are converted directly to the corresponding anilides by reaction 
with aniline, as described in Section 9.6.15, p. 1261. For anhydrides, heat a mix- 
ture of 1 g of the anhydride and 1 g of aniline in a boiling water bath for 5 
minutes, add 5 ml of water, boil and cool. Crystallise the resulting product from 
water or from aqueous ethanol. 

ANILIC ACIDS FROM CYCLIC ANHYDRIDES 

Dissolve 0.5 g of the anhydride in 15 ml of toluene by heating on a water bath, 
and add a solution of 0.5 ml of aniline in 3 ml of toluene. If the anilic acid does 
not separate after a short time, cool the solution, wash it with a little dilute 
hydrochloric acid to remove the excess of aniline and evaporate the solvent; the 
anilic acid will then usually crystallise. Recrystallise from aqueous ethanol. 
When heated above their melting points, anilic acids dehydrate to form cyclic 
imides, e.g.

The physical properties of a number of carboxylic acid chlorides and anhyd- 
rides are given in Tables 10.22, 10.23 and 10.24. 

9.6.17 ESTERS 

HYDROLYSIS 

Esters are usually characterised by hydrolysis followed by identification of the 
alcoholic and acidic components, although it is possible to prepare derivatives 
of both these components directly from the ester. 

In the routine examination of esters it is often a good plan to carry out two 
hydrolyses, [(,4) and (B) below] one for the isolation and characterisation of the 
parent acid, and the other for the isolation and identification of the parent alco- 
hol. 

A. Drop 1 g of sodium into 10 ml of methanol in a small flask provided with a 
small water condenser; heat the mixture until all the sodium has dissolved. Cool, 
and add 1 g of the ester and 0.5 ml of water. Frequently the sodium salt of the 
acid will be deposited either at once or after boiling for a few minutes. If this 
occurs, filter off the solid at once, wash it with a little methanol and convert it 
into the p-bromophenacyl ester, p-nitrobenzyl ester or S-benzyl isothiouronium 
salt (for experimental details, see Section 9.6.15, p. 1261). If no solid separates, 
continue the boiling for 30-60 minutes, boil off the alcohol, allow to cool, render 
the product just neutral to phenolphthalein with dilute sulphuric or hydro- 
chloric acid, convert the sodium salt present in solution into a crystalline deriv- 
ative (Section 9.6.15, p. 1261) and determine its melting point. 

B. Boil 2 g of the ester with 30 ml of 10 per cent sodium or potassium hydrox- 
ide solution under reflux for at least 1 hour. If the alcohol formed is water (or 
alkali) soluble, the completion of the hydrolysis will be indicated by the dis- 
appearance of the ester layer. Distil off the liquid through the same condenser 
and collect the first 3-5 ml of distillate. If a distinct layer separates on standing 
(or upon saturation of half the distillate with potassium carbonate), remove this 
layer with a capillary dropper, dry it with a little anhydrous potassium carbon- 
ate or anhydrous calcium sulphate and determine the b.p. by the Siwoloboff 
method (Section 2.34). Whether an insoluble alcohol separates out or not, pre- 
pare a crystalline derivative (e.g. the 3,5-dinitrobenzoate, Section 9.6.4, p. 1241) 
and determine its m.p. 

The residue in the flask will contain the sodium (or potassium) salt of the acid 
together with excess of alkali. Just acidify with dilute sulphuric acid and observe 
whether a crystalline acid separates; if it does, filter, recrystallise and identify 
(Section 9.6.15, p. 1261). If no crystalline sooid is obtained, the solution may be 
just neutralised to phenolphthalein and the solution of the akali salt used for the 

1266 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.6 



preparation of a crystalline derivative. This will confirm, if necessary, the results 
of hydrolysis by method A. If the time factor is important, either method A or 
the product of the caustic alkali hydrolysis may be used for the identification of 
the acid. 

The following notes may be useful: 

1. Some esters, e.g. methyl formate, dimethyl oxalate, dimethyl succinate, 
dimethyl and diethyl tartrate, are appreciably soluble in water. These are 
usually easily hydrolysed by alkali. 

2. If the original ester is a fat or oil and produces an odour of acrolein when 
heated, it may be a glyceride. Esters of ethylene glycol and of glycerol with 
simple fatty acids are viscous and of high b.p. They are hydrolysed (method 
A) and the alcohol distilled off. The residue is diluted (a soap may be formed) 
and acidified with hydrochloric acid (Congo red paper). The acid is filtered or 
extracted with ether. If no acid can be isolated by these methods, it must be 
simple and volatile, and should be separated by distillation. The residual 
aqueous solution of glycol or glycerol is neutralised, evaporated to a syrup on 
a water bath and extracted with ethanol or with ethyl acetate; the solvent is 
evaporated and the glycol or glycerol in the residue is identified as usual. 

3. P-Keto esters (e.g. ethyl acetoacetate) are soluble in solutions of caustic alkalis 

but not in sodium carbonate solution. They give colours with freshly pre- 
pared ferric chloride solution; a little ethanol should be added to bring the 
ester into solution. Sodium ethoxide solution reacts to yield sodio com- 
pounds, which usually crystallise out in the cold. They are hydrolysed by 
boiling sulphuric acid to the corresponding ketones, which can be identified 
as usual (Section 9.6.13, p. 1257). 

A slight modification in the procedure for isolating the products of hydrolysis 
is necessary for phenolic (or phenyl) esters since the alkaline solution will con- 
tain both the alkali phenate and the alkali salt of the organic acid: upon acidi- 
fication, both the phenol and the acid will be liberated. Two methods may be 
used for separating the phenol and the acid. 

(i) Acidify the cold alkaline reaction mixture with dilute sulphuric acid (use 
litmus or Congo red paper) and extract both the acid and the phenol with ether. 
Remove the acid by washing the ethereal extract with saturated sodium hydro- 
gen carbonate solution until effervescence ceases; retain the aqueous washings. 
Upon evaporating the ether, the phenol remains; it may be identified by its 
action upon ferric chloride solution, by the formation of a crystalline derivative 
with bromine water, or by any of the methods given in Section 9.6.6, p. 1248. 
Acidify the aqueous washings with dilute sulphuric acid while stirring steadily, 
and investigate the organic acid (Section 9.6.15, p. 1261). 

(ii) Add dilute sulphuric acid, with stirring, to the cold alkaline solution until 
the solution is acid to litmus or Congo red paper, and the acid, if a solid, com- 
mences to separate as a faint permanent precipitate. Now add dilute sodium car- 
bonate solution until the solution is alkaline (litmus paper) and any precipitate 
has completely redissolved. Extract the clear solution twice with ether; evapor- 
ate or distil the ether from the ethereal solution on a water bath, and identify the 
residual phenol as under (i). Remove the dissolved ether from the aqueous solu- 
tion by boiling, acidify with dilute sulphuric acid and identify the organic acid 
present (see Section 9.6.15, p. 1261).

9.6 PRACTICAL 0R6ANIC CHEMISTRY 



DIRECT IDENTIFICATION OF THE ALCOHOLIC COMPONENT OF 
AN ESTER 

The alcohol components of many simple esters may be identified as the crystal- 
line 3,5-dinitrobenzoates (compare Section 9.6.15, p. 1261) by heating them with 
3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid in the presence of a little concentrated sulphuric acid: 



R 1 -CQ 2 R 2 + 3,5-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -C0 2 H ^= 



R 1 -C0 2 H + 3,5-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -C0 2 R 2 

The reaction does not appear to be applicable if either of the groups R 1 or R 2 
reacts readily with concentrated sulphuric acid; esters of molecular weight in 
excess of about 250 react with difficulty. 

Dissolve 2 drops of concentrated sulphuric acid in 2 ml of the ester and add 
1 .5 g of 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid. If the b.p. is above 1 50 °C heat the mixture, with 
frequent shaking at first, in an oil bath at about 1 50 °C. If the 3,5-dinitrobenzoic 
acid dissolves within 15 minutes, heat the mixture for 30 minutes, otherwise 60 
minutes heating is required. Allow the reaction mixture to cool, dissolve it in 
25 ml of ether and extract thoroughly with 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution 
(c. 25 ml). Wash the ethereal solution with water, and remove the ether. Dissolve 
the residue (which is usually an oil) in 5 ml of hot ethanol, add hot water cau- 
tiously until the 3,5-dinitrobenzoate commences to separate, cool and stir. 
Recrystallise the derivative from dilute ethanol: the yield is 0.1-0.2 g. 

DIRECT IDENTIFICATION OF THE ACIDIC COMPONENT OF AN 
ESTER 

The following procedures may be regarded as alternative to that described 
above involving hydrolysis of the ester. 

Anilides or/Moluidides of acids from esters. Esters are converted into the corres- 
ponding anilides or p-toluidides by treatment with anilino- or with p-toluidino- 
magnesium bromide, which are readily obtained from any simple Grignard 
reagent and aniline or p-toluidine: 

ArNH 2 + RMgX &gt;■ ArNHMgX + RH 

2ArNHMgX + R'-C0 2 R 2 &gt; R 1 -C(OMgX)(NHAr) 2 + Mg(OR 2 )X ^^&gt; 

R'-CONHAr + ArNH 2 + Mg(OH)X + R 2 OH 

This procedure is speedy, economical and employs materials which are readily 
available. It is not satisfactory for esters of dibasic acids. 

Add 4.0 g (4.0 ml) of pure aniline dropwise to a cold solution of ethylmagne- 
sium bromide prepared from 1.0 g of magnesium, 5.0 g (3.5 ml) of ethyl bromide 
and 30 ml of pure, sodium-dried ether. When the vigorous evolution of ethane 
has ceased, introduce 0.02 mol of the ester in 10 ml of anhydrous ether, and 
warm the mixture on a water bath for 10 minutes; cool. Add dilute hydrochloric 
acid to dissolve the magnesium compounds and excess of aniline. Separate the 
ethereal layer, dry it with magnesium sulphate and evaporate the ether. Recrys- 
tallise the residual anilide, which is obtained in almost quantitative yield, from 
dilute ethanol or other suitable solvent. 

Alternatively, add a solution of 4.5 g of p-toluidine in dry ether to the 
Grignard reagent prepared from 1.0 g of magnesium as detailed above. Then in- 
troduce 1.0 g (or 0.02 mol) of the ester and proceed as described for anilides.

/V-Benzylamides of acids from esters. Esters are converted into the Af-benzyl- 
amides of the corresponding acids by heating with benzylamine in the presence 
of a little ammonium chloride as catalyst: 

R 1 -C0 2 R 2 + Ph-CH 2 NH 2 ► R 1 -CONHCH 2 -Ph + R 2 OH 

The reaction (which is essentially the direct aminolysis of esters with benzyl- 
amine) proceeds readily when R 2 is methyl or ethyl. Esters of higher alcohols 
should preferably be subjected to a preliminary methanolysis by treatment with 
sodium methoxide in methanol: 

R'-C0 2 R 2 + MeOH MeC ° 2Na &gt; R'-CO,Me + R 2 OH 

Af-Benzylamides are recommended when the corresponding acid is liquid 
and/or water-soluble so that it cannot itself serve as a derivative. The benzyl- 
amides derived from the simple fatty acids or their esters are not altogether satis- 
factory since they are often low melting; those derived from most hydroxy acids 
and from polybasic acids or their esters are formed in good yield and are easily 
purified. The esters of aromatic acids yield satisfactory derivatives but the 
method must compete with the equally simple process of hydrolysis and precipi- 
tation of the free acid, an obvious derivative when the acid is a solid. The pro- 
cedure fails with esters of keto acids, sulphonic acids and inorganic acids and 
some halogenated aliphatic esters. 

Reflux a mixture of 1 g of the ester, 3 ml of benzylamine and 0. 1 g of powdered 
ammonium chloride for 1 hour in a Pyrex test tube fitted with a short condenser. 
Wash the cold reaction mixture with water to remove the excess of benzylamine. 
If the product does not crystallise, stir it with a little water containing a drop or 
two of dilute hydrochloric acid. If crystallisation does not result, some un- 
changed ester may be present: boil with water for a few minutes in an evapor- 
ating dish to volatilise the ester. Collect the sold Af-benzylamide on a filter, wash 
it with a little petroleum, b.p. 100-120 °C, and recrystallise it from dilute ethanol, 
ethyl acetate or acetone. 

If the ester does not yield a benzylamide by this procedure, convert it into the 
methyl ester by refluxing 1 g for 30 minutes with 5 ml of absolute methanol in 
which about 0.1 g of sodium has been dissolved. Remove the methanol by distil- 
lation and treat the residual ester as above. 

The melting points of the Af-benzylamides are collected in Tables 10.20 and 
10.21. 

Acid hydrazides from esters. Methyl and ethyl esters react with hydrazine to give 
acid hydrazides: 

R-C0 2 Me + H 2 NNH 2 &gt;■ R-CONHNH 2 + MeOH 

The hydrazides are often crystalline and then serve as useful derivatives. Esters 
of higher alcohols should be converted first to the methyl esters by boiling with 
sodium methoxide in methanol (see under Af-benzylamides). 

Place 1.0 ml of hydrazine hydrate (CAUTION: corrosive chemical) in a test 
tube fitted with a short reflux condenser. Add 1.0 g of the methyl or ethyl ester 
dropwise (or portionwise) and heat the mixture gently under reflux for 15 
minutes. Then add just enough absolute ethanol through the condenser to pro- 
duce a clear solution, reflux for a further 2-3 hours, distil off the ethanol and 

1269 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



cool. Filter off the crystals of the acid hydrazide, and recrystallise from ethanol, 
dilute ethanol or from water. 

The melting points of the hydrazides of some aliphatic and aromatic acids are 
collected in Tables 10.20 and 10.21. 

Tables 10.25 and 10.26 list the boiling points, densities and refractive indices 
of a number of selected esters. 

9.6.18 PRIMARY AMIDES 

HYDROLYSIS 

Amides may be hydrolysed by boiling with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solu- 
tion to the corresponding acid (as the sodium salt). The alkaline solution should 
be acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid; the liberated acid if sparingly water- 
soluble is isolated by filtration, otherwise any water-soluble acidic component 
may be isolated by extraction with ether or by distillation from the acidic 
aqueous solution. The procedure is illustrated by the following experimental 
details for benzamide. Place 1.5 g of benzamide and 25 ml of 10 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution in a 100-ml conical or round-bottomed flask equipped with 
a reflux condenser. Boil the mixture gently for 30 minutes; ammonia is freely 
evolved. Detach the condenser and continue the boiling in the open flask for 3-4 
minutes to expel the residual ammonia. Cool the solution in ice, and add con- 
centrated hydrochloric acid until the mixture is strongly acid; benzoic acid 
separates immediately. Leave the mixture in ice until cold, filter at the pump, 
wash with a little cold water and drain well. Recrystallise the benzoic acid from 
hot water. 

Hydrolysis may also be effected (but usually rather less readily) with 20 per 
cent sulphuric acid. 

XANTHYLAMIDES 

Xanthhydrol reacts with primary amides with the formation of crystalline 
xanthylamides or 9-aclyaminoxanthens. 

OH NH-CO-R 

+ R-CONH 2 



Dissolve 0.25 g of xanthhydrol* in 3.5 ml of glacial acetic acid; if an oil separ- 
ates (as is sometimes the case with commercial material), allow to settle for a 

* Best results are obtained with reagent freshly prepared by the reduction of xanthone with sodium 
amalgam. Prepare an amalgam from 0.9 g of clean sodium and 75 g (5.5 ml) of mercury as described 
in Section 4.2.70, p. 464, and then warm it in a stoppered Pyrex reagent bottle to 50 °C. Add a cold 
suspension of 2.5 g of commercial xanthone in 20 ml of rectified spirit, stopper the flask and shake 
vigorously releasing the pressure from time to time. The temperature rises rapidly to 60-70 °C, the 
xanthone passes into solution and a transient blue colour develops. After 5 minutes the solution is 
clear and colourless; after a further 10 minutes shaking, separate the mercury and wash it with 3 ml 
of ethanol. Filter the warm solution into 200 ml of cold distilled water with shaking. Filter the xanth- 
hydrol under suction, wash with water and dry. The yield of xanthhydrol, m.p. 122-123 °C, is 2.4 g. 
The product may be recrystallised from ethanol; it is comparatively unstable but may be kept in an 
alcoholic solution. 

1270 





INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.6 



short time and decant the supernatant solution. Add 0.25 g of the amide, shake 
and allow to stand. If a crystalline derivative does not separate in about 10 
minutes, warm on a water bath for a period not exceeding 30 minutes, and allow 
to cool. Filter off the solid xanthylamide (9-acylaminoxanthen) and recrystallise 
it from dioxane-water or from acetic acid-water, dry at 80 °C for 1 5 minutes and 
determine the m.p. 

Some amides do not dissolve in glacial acetic acid; in such cases a mixture of 
2 ml of glacial acetic acid and 3 ml of water may be used as a solvent for the reac- 
tion. Urea may be characterised as the di-xanthyl derivative (m.p. 274 °C) pre- 
pared in acetic acid. Di- and tri-chloroacetamide, oxamide, and salicylamide do 
not give satisfactory results. 

The melting points of aliphatic and aromatic primary carboxylic acid amides 
and those of the corresponding xanthylamides are collected in Tables 10.27 and 
10.28. 

9.6.19 SUBSTITUTED AMIDES 

HYDROLYSIS 

Substituted aromatic carboxylic acid amides of the type ArCONHR and 
Ar-CONR 2 are only slowly attacked by aqueous alkali and are characterised by 
hydrolysis under acidic conditions; 70 per cent sulphuric acid (prepared by care- 
fully adding 4 parts of acid to 3 parts of water) is the preferred reagent. Use the 
general procedure which has been outlined on p. 1 229; characterise the acidic and 
basic components. 

FUSION WITH SODA-LIME 

The basic component is liberated upon fusion with sode-lime and at the same 
time the aroyl group yields a hydrocarbon. Use the experimental details de- 
scribed for carboxylic acids, Section 9.6.15, p. 1261; characterise the base by the 
preparation of a suitable derivative. 

The melting points of some typical substituted aromatic amides are collected 
in Table 10.29. Other examples will be found in the appropriate columns of 
Tables 10.20, 10.33 and 10.34. 

9.6.20 NITRILES 

HYDROLYSIS TO THE CARBOXYLIC ACID 

Hydrolysis with alkali. When nitriles are treated with 20-40 per cent sodium or 
potassium hydroxide solution, there is no reaction in the cold; upon prolonged 
boiling hydrolysis proceeds comparatively slowly (compare primary amides 
which are rapidly hydrolysed) to the sodium salt of the acid and ammonia. The 
reaction is complete when ammonia is no longer evolved: 

R-CN + H 2 + NaOH &gt;■ R-C0 2 Na + NH 3 

The excess of alkali is then neutralised to phenolphthalein or to Congo red with 
dilute hydrochloric acid and the solution is evaporated to dryness on the water 
bath. The acid may then be characterised as the S-benzylisothiouronium salt or 
as the p-bromophenacyl ester (Section 9.6.15, p. 1263). In many instances the 
derivative may be prepared directly from the neutralised solution. 

1271 



9.E PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Hydrolysis with acid. Most nitrites are hydrolysed by boiling with 5-8 times the 
weight of 50-75 per cent sulphuric acid under reflux for 2-3 hours: 

2R-CN + H 2 S0 4 + 4H 2 ► 2R-C0 2 H + (NH 4 ) 2 S0 4 

If the acid is a simple aliphatic monobasic acid it can usually be distilled directly 
from the reaction mixture. If this procedure is not possible, the reaction mixture 
is poured into excess of crushed ice, and the acid is isolated by ether extraction 
or by other suitable means. The acid is then characterised (Section 9.6.15, p. 
1261). The addition of hydrochloric acid (as sodium chloride; say, 5% of the 
weight of sulphuric acid) increases the rate of the reaction. 

A mixture of 50 per cent sulphuric acid and glacial acetic acid may be used 
with advantage in the case of difficultly-hydrolysable aromatic nitriles. The reac- 
tion product is poured into water, and the organic acid is separated from any 
unchanged nitrite or from amide by means of sodium carbonate solution. 

Those nitriles which yield water-insoluble amides (e.g. the higher alkyl cyan- 
ides), conversion to the amide often leads to a satisfactory derivative. The hydra- 
tion if effected by warming a solution of the nitrile in concentrated sulphuric 
acid for a few minutes, cooling and pouring into water. For experimental details 
see p. 1229. 

REDUCTION TO A PRIMARY AMINE AND CONVERSION INTO A 
SUBSTITUTED PHENYLTHIOUREA. 

Reduction of a nitrile with sodium and ethanol yields the primary amine, which 
may be identified by direct conversion into a substituted phenylthiourea. 

R-CN + 2H 2 -g^&gt; R-CH 2 NH 2 PhNCS &gt; R-CH 2 NH-CS-NH-Ph 

Dissolve 1.0 g of the nitrile in 20 ml of absolute ethanol in a dry 200-ml 
round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Add through the top of the 
condenser 1 .5 g of clean sodium (previously cut into small pieces) at such a rate 
that the reaction, although vigorous, remains under control. When all the 
sodium has reacted (10-15 minutes), cool the reaction mixture to about 20 °C, 
and add 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid dropwise through the con- 
denser while swirling the contents of the flask vigorously: the final solution 
should be acid to litmus. Connect the flask to a still-head and condenser, and 
distil off about 20 ml of liquid (dilute ethanol). Cool the flask and fit a small 
dropping funnel into the top of the still-head. Place 15 ml of 40 per cent sodium 
hydroxide solution in the dropping funnel, attach an adapter to the end of the 
condenser and so arrange it that the end dips into about 3 ml of water contained 
in a 50-ml conical flask. Add the sodium hydroxide solution dropwise and with 
shaking: a vigorous reaction ensues. When all the alkali has been added, separ- 
ate the amine by distillation until the contents of the flask are nearly dry. 

Add 0.5 ml of phenyl isothiocyanate to the distillate and shake the mixture 
vigorously for 3-4 minutes. If no derivative separates, crystallisation may be 
induced by cooling the flask in ice and 'scratching' the walls with a glass rod. 
Filter off the crude product, wash it with a little 50 per cent ethanol and recrys- 
tallise from hot dilute ethanol.

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.6 



a-IMINOALKYLMERCAPTOACETIC ACID HYDROCHLORIDES 

Mercaptoacetic acid (thioglycollic acid) reacts with nitriles in the presence of 
hydrogen chloride to give oc-iminoalkylmercaptoacetic acid hydrochlorides: 

© e 
NH 2 }C1 

R-CN + HSCH,-CO,H + HC1 *■ R-CC 

SCH 2 -C0 2 H 

These salts have sharp and reproducible decomposition temperatures but no 
true melting points. They act as dibasic acids when titrated with standard alkali, 
thymol blue being used as indicator. 

Dissolve 1.0 g of the nitrile and 2.0 g of mercaptoacetic acid in 25 ml of 
sodium-dried ether in a dry test tube or small flask. Cool the solution in ice and 
saturate it with dry hydrogen chloride (5-10 minutes). Stopper the test tube or 
flask and keep it at °C until crystallisation is complete (15-60 minutes). Collect 
the crystals by suction filtration, wash with anhydrous ether and dry in a 
vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide pellets (to remove hydrogen 
chloride) and paraffin wax shavings (to remove ether). 

ACYL PHLOROGLUCINOLS 

Crystalline derivatives of aliphatic nitriles may be prepared by an application of 
the Hoesch reaction. Equimolecular proportions of phloroglucinol and the 
nitrile react in dry ethereal solution in the presence of anhydrous zinc chloride 
and hydrogen chloride to give an imine hydrochloride, which is converted into a 
solid alkyl trihydroxyphenyl ketone by hydrolysis. The alkyl 2,4,6-trihydroxy- 
phenyl ketones are usually highly crystalline solids of sharp melting point and 
are purified by recrystallisation from hot water. Many contain water of crystal- 
lisation which can be removed by drying in vacuo at about 100 °C; the melting 
points of both the hydrated and anhydrous compound should be determined. 

A detailed preparative procedure is described in Expt 6.125, where the reac- 
tion is formulated. The following concise general instructions are suitable for 
small-scale working. 

Add 0.4 g of powdered, anhydrous zinc chloride to a solution of 1.1 g of 
anhydrous phloroglucinol in 25 ml of sodium-dried ether, and introduce the 
nitrile (0.01 mol) dissolved in 5 ml of dry ether. Pass a steady stream of dry 
hydrogen chloride through the solution for 25-30 minutes; it becomes turbid 
after 2-3 minutes but the turbidity subsequently disappears. Decant the super- 
natant liquid, dissolve the residual oil or crystals in 25 ml of water and shake the 
aqueous solution with two 20 ml portions of ether. Concentrate the aqueous 
layer to about 10-12 ml. The hydroxy ketone separates upon cooling; recrystal- 
lise it from hot water and dry in the air. The hydrate is thus produced. 

Physical data for aliphatic and aromatic nitriles are collected in Tables 10.30 
and 10.31 respectively. 

9.6.21 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY AMINES 

ACETYL DERIVATIVES 

Primary and secondary amines are best acetylated with acetic anhydride: 

RNH 2 + (Me-CO) 2 &gt; Me-CONHR + Me-C0 2 H 

R*R 2 NH + (Me-CO) 2 &gt; Me-CONR'R 2 + Me-C0 2 H 

1273 



9.E PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Acetyl chloride is not so satisfactory since an equivalent quantity of the amine 
hydrochloride is simultaneously produced: 

2RNH 2 + Me-COCl &gt;■ Me-CONHR + RNH 3 }C1 

Reflux gently in a test tube under a short air condenser 1 g of the base with 
2.5 moles [or 3.0 g (3.0 ml) if the molecular weight is unknown] of acetic anhyd- 
ride for 10-15 minutes. Cool the reaction mixture and pour it into 20 ml of cold 
water. Boil to decompose the excess of acetic anhydride. When cold, filter the 
residual insoluble acetyl derivative and wash it with a little cold water. Recrys- 
tallise from water or from dilute ethanol. 

Certain ort/io-substituted derivatives of aromatic amines are difficult to 
acetylate under the above conditions owing to steric hindrance. The process is 
facilitated by the addition of a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid (com- 
pare Expt 6.59), which acts as a catalyst, and by the use of a large excess of acetic 
anhydride. 

Excellent results may be obtained by conducting the acetylation in aqueous 
solution. Dissolve 0.5 g of the amine in 2 m hydrochloric acid, and add a little 
crushed ice. Introduce a solution of 5g of hydrated sodium acetate in 25 ml of 
water, followed by 5 ml of acetic anhydride. Shake the mixture in the cold until 
the smell of acetic anhydride disappears. Collect the solid acetyl derivative, and 
recrystallise it from water or dilute ethanol. 

BENZOYL DERIVATIVES 

Both primary and secondary amines form benzoyl derivatives under the con- 
ditions of the Schotten-Baumann reaction (see Section 6.6.2, p. 916, for a discus- 
sion). 

Suspend 1 g (or 1 ml) of the substance in 20 ml of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution in a well-corked boiling tube or small conical flask, and add 2 ml of ben- 
zoyl chloride, c. 0.5 ml at a time, with constant shaking, and cooling in water (if 
necessary). Shake vigorously for 5-10 minutes until the odour of the benzoyl 
chloride has disappeared. Make sure that the mixture has an alkaline reaction. 
Filter off the solid benzoyl derivative, wash it with a little cold water and recrys- 
tallise it from ethanol or dilute ethanol. 

If the benzoyl derivative is soluble in alkali, precipitate it together with the 
benzoic acid derived from the reagent by the addition of hydrochloric acid: filter 
and extract the product with cold ether or light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C) to 
remove the benzoic acid. 

The following alternative procedure is sometimes useful. 

To a solution of 0.5 g of the amine in 4 ml of dry pyridine and 10 ml of dry 
benzene (CAUTION), add dropwise 0.5 ml of benzoyl chloride. Heat the mix- 
ture under reflux on a water bath at 60-70 °C for 20-30 minutes and then pour 
into 80- 100 ml of water. Separate the benzene layer and extract the aqueous 
layer with 10 ml of benzene. Wash the combined benzene solutions with 5 ml of 5 
per cent sodium carbonate solution, followed by 5 ml of water, and dry with 
magnesium sulphate. Filter off the desiccant through a small fluted filter paper 
and concentrate the benzene solution to a small volume (3-4 ml). Stir 1 5-20 ml 
of hexane into the residue: the crystalline product separates. Filter and wash 
with a little hexane. Recrystallise from a mixture of cyclohexane with hexane or 
with ethyl acetate; alternatively use ethanol or dilute ethanol for recrystallisa- 
tion.

BENZENESULPHONYL AND TOLUENE-/J-SULPHONYL 
DERIVATIVES 

Treat 1 g (1 ml) of the amine with 4 molar equivalents of 10 per cent sodium or 
potassium hydroxide solution (say, 20 ml), and add 1.5 moles (or 3 g if the 
molecular weight is unknown) of benzenesulphonyl or toluene-p-sulphonyl 
chloride in small portions with constant shaking. To remove the excess of acid 
chloride, either shake vigorously or warm gently. Acidify with dilute hydro- 
chloric acid and filter off the sulphonamide. Recrystallise it from ethanol or 
dilute ethanol. 

If the presence of a disulphonyl derivative from a primary amine is suspected 
(e.g. formation of a precipitate in alkaline solution even after dilution), reflux the 
precipitate, obtained after acidifying, with a solution of 1 g of sodium in 20 ml of 
rectified spirit for 1 5 minutes. Evaporate the ethanol, dilute with water and filter 
if necessary; acidify with dilute hydrochloric acid. Collect the sulphonyl derivat- 
ive and recrystallise it from ethanol or dilute ethanol. 

It is generally more convenient to employ the solid toluene-p-sulphonyl 
chloride (m.p. 69 °C) rather than the liquid benzenesulphonyl chloride. More- 
over, the benzenesulphonamides of certain secondary amines are oils or low 
melting point solids that may be difficult to crystallise: the toluene-p-sulphon- 
amides usually have higher melting points and are more satisfactory as derivat- 
ives.* 

Feebly basic amines, e.g. the nitroanilines, generally react so slowly with ben- 
zenesulphonyl chloride that most of the acid chloride is hydrolysed by the 
aqueous alkali before a reasonable yield of the sulphonamide is produced; 
indeed, o-nitroanaline gives little or no sulphonamide under the above con- 
ditions. Excellent results are obtained by carrying out the reaction in pyridine 
solution: 

o-N0 2 -C 6 H 4 -NH 2 + Ph-S0 2 Cl p ^" e &gt; o-N0 2 -C 6 H 4 -NH-S0 2 -Ph 

Reflux a mixture of 1 g (1 ml) of the amine, 2-3 g of benzenesulphonyl chlor- 
ide and 6 ml of pyridine (CAUTION) for 30 minutes. Pour the reaction mixture 
into 10 ml of cold water and stir until the product crystallises. Filter off the solid 
and recrystallise it from ethanol or dilute ethanol. 

Most amines react so rapidly in pyridine solution that the reaction is usually 
complete after refluxing for 10-15 minutes. 

FORMYL DERIVATIVES 

Formic acid condenses with primary and secondary amines to yield formyl 
derivatives: 

Ar-NHR + H-C0 2 H &gt;■ Ar-N(R)-CHO + H 2 

Reflux 0.5 g of the amine with 5 ml of 90 per cent formic acid (CAUTION: in 
handling) for 10 minutes, and dilute the hot solution with 10 ml of cold water. 
Cool in ice and, in some cases, saturate with salt if the derivative does not separ- 
ate immediately. Filter, wash with cold water and recrystallise from water, etha- 
nol or light petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C). 

* For the separation of mixtures of primary, secondary and tertiary amines using benzenesulphonyl 
or toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride (Hinsberg's method), see p. 1288.

9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



DERIVATIVES WITH 3-NITROPHTHALIC ANHYDRIDE 

3-Nitrophthalic anhydride reacts with primary and secondary amines to yield 
nitrophthalamic acids; it does not react with tertiary amines. The phthalamic 
acid derived from a primary amine undergoes dehydration when heated to 
145 °C to give a neutral Af-substituted 3-nitrophthalimide. The phthalamic acid 
from a secondary amine is stable to heat and is, of course, soluble in alkali. The 
reagent therefore provides a method for distinguishing between, and separating 
a mixture of, primary and secondary amines.

ride (Expt 6.162) in an oil bath at 145-150 °C for 10-20 minutes, pour the 
reaction mixture into a small mortar or Pyrex dish and allow it to solidify. 
Recrystallise from ethanol, aqueous ethanol or ethanol-acetone. 

^/-SUBSTITUTED PHTHALIMIDES (FROM PRIMARY AMINES) 

Phthalic anhydride reacts with primary amines similarly to yield Af-substituted 
phthalimides. 

Dissolve 0.5 g of the primary amine and 0.5 g of phthalic anhydride in 5 ml of 
glacial acetic acid and reflux for 20-30 minutes. (If the amine salt is used, add 1 g 
of sodium acetate.) The Af-substituted phthalimide separates out on cooling. 
Recrystallise it from ethanol or from glacial acetic acid. 

2,4-DINITROPHENYL DERIVATIVES 

The halogen atom in l-chloro-2,4,-dinitro benzene is reactive and coloured crys- 
talline compounds (usually yellow or red) are formed with primary and with 
secondary amines: 

2,4-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 Cl + R-NH 2 ► 2,4-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H 3 -NH-R + HC1 

Dissolve 1.0 g (or 1.0ml) of the amine and l.Og of l-chloro-2,4-dinitro- 
benzene in 5-10ml of ethanol, add a slight excess of anhydrous potassium car- 
bonate or of powdered fused sodium acetate, reflux the mixture on a water bath 
for 20-30 minutes and then pour into water. Wash the precipitated solid with 
dilute sodium carbonate solution, followed by dilute hydrochloric acid. Recrys- 
tallise from ethanol, dilute ethanol or glacial acetic acid. 

Note. Chlorodinitrobenzene must be handled with care (use disposable gloves). It if 
touches the skin, wash it off with industrial spirit and then copiously with water.

PHENYLTHIOUREAS 

Primary and secondary amines react with phenyl isothiocyanate to yield 
phenylthioureas: 

Ph-N=C=S + RNH 2 &gt; Ph-NH-CS-NHR 

Ph-N=C=S + R 2 NH &gt;■ Ph-NH-CS-NR 2 

Phenyl isothiocyanate is not sensitive to water; the reaction may be carried 
out with an aqueous solution of an amine. 

Dissolve equivalent quantities of the reagent and of the amine in a small 
amount of rectified spirit. If no reaction appears to take place in the cold, reflux 
the mixture for 5-15 minutes. Upon cooling (and 'scratching' with a glass rod, if 
necessary) the crystalline thiourea separates. Recrystallise it from rectified spirit 
or from 60-80 per cent ethanol. 

Alternatively, mix equal amounts (say, 0.2 g of each) of the amine and phenyl 
isothiocyanate in a test tube and shake for 2 minutes. If no reaction occurs, heat 
the mixture gently for 2 minutes and then cool in ice until the mass solidifies. 
Powder the solid, wash it with a little light petroleum (b.p. 100-120 °C) and 
recrystallise from rectified spirit. 

1-Naphthyl isothiocyanate yields crystalline 1-naphthylthioureas and is sim- 
ilarly applied. 

PICRATES 

Picric acid combines with amines to yield salts (picrates), which usually possess 
characteristic melting points. Most picrates have the composition 1 mol amine : 
1 mol picric acid. The picrates of the amines, particularly of the more basic ones, 
are generally more stable than the molecular re-complexes formed between picric 
acid and the hydrocarbons (compare Section 9.6.3, p. 1238). 

If the amine is soluble in water, mix it with a slight excess (about 25%) of a 
saturated solution of picric acid in water (the solubility in cold water is about 
1%). If the amine is insoluble in water, dissolve it by the addition of 2-3 drops of 
dilute hydrochloric acid (1 : 1) for each 2-3 ml of water, then add a slight excess 
of the reagent. If a heavy precipitate does not form immediately after the addi- 
tion of the picric acid solution, allow the mixture to stand for some time and 
then shake vigorously. Filter off the precipitated picrate and recrystallise it from 
boiling water, ethanol or dilute ethanol, boiling 10 per cent acetic acid, chloro- 
form, or, best, toluene. 

The following alternative procedure may sometimes be employed. Dissolve 
0.5 g of the amine in 5 ml of rectified spirit and add 5 ml of a cold saturated solu- 
tion of picric acid in ethanol. Warm on a water bath for 5 minutes and allow to 
cool. Collect the precipitated picrate and recrystallise it as above. 

BENZYLIDENE DERIVATIVES 

Primary aromatic amines generally condense directly with benzaldehyde to form 
benzylidene derivatives (Schiffs bases or anils). 

R-NH 2 + Ph-CHO &gt;■ R-N=CH-Ph + H 2 

These are often crystalline and therefore useful for the characterisation of prim- 
ary amines. Diamines may, of course, yield di-benzylidene derivatives. 

Heat the amine with 1 or 2 moles of redistilled benzaldehyde (according to 
whether the base is a monamine or diamine) to 100 °C for 10 minutes; if the 

1277 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



molecular weight is unknown, use 1 g of the base and 1 or 2 g of benzaldehyde. 
Sometimes a solvent, such as methanol (5 ml) or acetic acid, may be used. 
Recrystallise from ethanol, dilute ethanol or toluene. 

The melting points of the derivatives of a number of aliphatic and aromatic 
primary and secondary amines are collected in Tables 10.32, 10.33 and 10.34. 

9.6.22 TERTIARY AMINES 

PICRATES 

Experimental details are given under Primary and secondary amines, Section 
9.6.21, above. 

METHIODIDES 

Methyl iodide (CAUTION) reacts with tertiary amines to form the crystalline 
quaternary ammonium iodide (methiodide): 

R'R^N + Mel &gt; R'R^NMe}®! 6 

Some of these derivatives are hygroscopic. 

Allow a mixture of 0.5 g of the tertiary amine and 0.5 ml of colourless methyl 
iodide* to stand for 5 minutes. If reaction has not occurred, warm under reflux 
for 5 minutes on a water bath and then cool in ice-water. The mixture will gener- 
ally set solid: if it does not, wash it with a little dry ether and 'scratch' the sides of 
the tube with a glass rod. Recrystallise the solid product from absolute ethanol 
or methanol, ethyl acetate, glacial acetic acid or ethanol-ether. 

Alternatively, dissolve 0.5 g of the tertiary amine and 0.5 ml of methyl iodide 
in 5 ml of dry ether or toluene, and allow the mixture to stand for several hours. 
The methiodide precipitates, usually in a fairly pure state. Filter, wash with a 
little of the solvent and recrystallise as above. 

The ethiodide is prepared similarly, using ethyl iodide. 

METHOTOLUENE-/J-SULPHONATES 

Methyl toluene-p-sulphonate combines with many tertiary amines to yield crys- 
talline derivatives: 

R^^N + p-Me-QJVSOsMe ► R'R^NMe} VMe-C 6 H 4 -S0 3 } e 

Dissolve 2-3 g of methyl toluene-p-sulphonate in 10 ml of dry toluene, add 
1 g of the amine and boil the mixture for 20-30 minutes. Cool, and filter the pre- 
cipitated quaternary salt. Recrystallise by dissolving the solid in the minimum 
volume of boling ethanol and then adding ethyl acetate until crystallisation 
commences. Filter the cold mixture, dry rapidly on a porous plate and deter- 
mine the m.p. immediately. 

The benzyltrialkylammonium salts (R 3 N-CH 2 -Ph} e Cl e ) are prepared sim- 
ilarly; 3 g of redistilled benzyl chloride replaces the methyl toluene-p-sulphonate. 

REACTION WITH NITROUS ACID 

AT,AT-Dialkylanilines yield green solid p-nitroso derivatives on treatment with 

* Keep a coil of copper wire (prepared by winding copper wire round a glass tube) or a little silver 
powder in the bottle, which should be of brown or amber glass; the methyl iodide will remain colour- 
less indefinitely. Ethyl iodide may sometimes give more satisfactory results.

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.E 



nitrous acid (see p. 1215). Illustrative preparative details for p-nitrosodimethyl- 
aniline are as follows. Dissolve 1.0 g of dimethylaniline in 10 ml of dilute hydro- 
chloric acid (1:1), cool to 0-5 °C and slowly add, with stirring, a solution of 
0.70 g of sodium nitrite in 4 ml of water. After 20-30 minutes, filter off the pre- 
cipitated yellow hydrochloride,* and wash it with a little dilute hydrochloric 
acid. Dissolve the precipitate in the minimum volume of water, add a solution of 
sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to decompose the hydrochloride (i.e. 
until alkaline) and extract the free base with ether. Evaporate the ether, and 
recrystallise the residual green crystals of p-nitrosodimethylaniline from light 
petroleum (b.p. 60-80 °C) or from toluene. The pure compound has m.p. 85 °C. 
The melting points of the derivatives of a number of aliphatic and aromatic 
tertiary amines are collected in Table 10.35. 



9.6.23 /-AMINO ACIDS 

2,4-DINITROPHENYL DERIVATIVES 

The reaction between l-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and amino acids leads to 
2,4-dinitrophenyl derivatives: these are often crystalline and possess relatively 
sharp melting points. 

2,4-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H,F + NH 2 -CHR-C0 2 H (i)NaHCO? &gt; 

(11) HC1 

2,4-(N0 2 ) 2 -C 6 H 3 -NH-CHR-C0 2 H 

To a solution or suspension of 0.25 g of the amino acid in 5 ml of water and 
0.5 g of sodium hydrogen carbonate, add a solution of 0.4 g of l-fluoro-2,4- 
dinitrobenzene in 3 ml of ethanol. Shake the reaction mixture vigorously and 
allow to stand for 1 hour with intermittent vigorous shaking. Add 3 ml of satur- 
ated sodium chloride solution and extract with ether (2 x 5 ml) to remove 
unchanged reagent. Pour the aqueous layer into 12 ml of cold 5 per cent hydro- 
chloric acid with vigorous agitation: this mixture should be distinctly acid to 
Congo red indicator paper. If the product separates as an oil, try to induce crys- 
tallisation by 'scratching' or stirring. Collect the derivative by suction filtration 
and recrystallise it from 50 per cent ethanol. 

BENZOYL DERIVATIVES 

Dissolve 0.5 g of the amino acid in 10 ml of 10 per cent sodium hydrogen carbon- 
ate solution and add 1 g of benzoyl chloride. Shake the mixture vigorously in a 
stoppered test tube; remove the stopper from time to time since carbon dioxide 
is evolved. When the odour of benzoyl chloride has disappeared, acidify with 
dilute hydrochloric acid to Congo red and filter. Extract the solid with a little 
cold ether to remove any benzoic acid which may be present. Recrystallise the 
benzoyl derivative which remains from hot water or from dilute ethanol. 

3,5-DINITROBENZOYL DERIVATIVES 

The following experimental details are for glycine (aminoacetic acid) and may 
be easily adapted for any other amino acid. Dissolve 0.75 g of glycine in 20 ml of 



* The hydrochloride may not separate with other dialkylanilines. Add a slight excess of sodium car- 
bonate or sodium hydroxide to the solution, extract the free base with ether, etc. 

1279 



9.E PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



m sodium hydroxide solution and add 2.32 g of finely powdered 3,5-dinitro- 
benzoyl chloride. Shake the mixture vigorously in a stoppered test tube; the acid 
chloride soon dissolves. Continue the shaking for 2 minutes, filter (if necessary) 
and acidify with dilute hydrochloric acid to Congo red. Recrystallise the derivat- 
ive immediately from water or 50 per cent ethanol. 

Excess of the reagent should be avoided, if possible. If excess of dinitro- 
benzoyl chloride is used, this appears as the acid in the precipitate obtained 
upon acidification: the acid can be removed by shaking in the cold with a mix- 
ture of 5 volumes of light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C) and 2 volumes of ethanol. 
The glycine derivative is insoluble in this medium. For some amino acids 
(leucine, valine and phenylalanine) acetic acid should be used for acidification. 

TOLUENE-/J-SULPHONYL DERIVATIVES 

Amino acids react with toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride (compare Section 9.6.21, p. 
1275) under the following experimental conditions to yield, in many cases, crys- 
talline toluene-p-sulphonylamino acids. 

Dissolve 0.01 g equivalent of the amino acid in 20 ml of M sodium hydroxide 
solution and add a solution of 2g of toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride in 25 ml of 
ether; shake the mixture mechanically or stir vigorously for 3-4 hours. Separate 
the ether layer: acidify the aqueous layer to Congo red with dilute hydrochloric 
acid. The derivative usually crystallises out rapidly or will do so on standing in 
ice. Filter off the crystals and recrystallise from 4-5 ml of 60 per cent ethanol. 

With phenylalanine and tyrosine, the sodium salt of the derivative is spar- 
ingly soluble in water and separates during the initial reaction. Acidify the sus- 
pension to Congo red: the salts pass into solution and the mixture separates into 
two layers. The derivative is in the ethereal layer and crystallises from it within a 
few minutes. It is filtered off and recrystallised. 

2.4-DICHLOROPHENOXYACETYL DERIVATIVES 

Amino acids react with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetyl chloride to give crystalline 
derivatives: 

2,4C1 2 C 6 H,-OCH 2 -COC1 + H 2 N-CHR-C0 2 H ^^&gt; 

2,4-Cl 2 C 6 H,-0-CH 2 -CO-NH-CHR-C0 2 H 

Dissolve 0.01 mol of the amino acid in 30 ml of m sodium hydroxide solution 
and cool to 5 °C in a bath of ice. Add, with rapid stirring, 0.01 mol of 2,4- 
dichlorophenoxyacetyl chloride dissolved in 5 ml of dry toluene at such a rate 
(5-10 minutes) that the temperature of the mixture does not rise above 15°C, if 
the reaction mixture gels after the addition of the acid chloride, add water to thin 
it. Remove the ice bath and stir for 2-3 hours. Extract the resulting mixture with 
ether, and acidify the aqueous solution to Congo red with dilute hydrochloric 
acid. Collect the precipitate by filtration and recrystallise it from dilute ethanol. 

Commercial 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid may be recrystallised from tol- 
uene; m.p. 139-140°C. Reflux lOg of the acid with 15ml of thionyl chloride on a 
steam bath for 1 hour, distil off the excess of thionyl chloride at atmospheric 
pressure and the residue under reduced pressure: 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetyl 
chloride (8g) passes over at 155-157 °C/22-23 mmHg. It occasionally crystal- 
lises (m.p. 44.5-45.5 °C), but usually tends to remain as a supercooled liquid.

PHTHALOYL DERIVATIVES 

Many amino acids condense with phthalic anhydride at 180-185 °C to yield 
crystalline phthaloyl derivatives (Af-substituted phthalimides). 

CO ^^.CO 

p + H 2 N-CHR-C0 2 H ^^&gt; f £ VcHR-C0 2 H 
CO ^^~CO 

Place 0.5 g of the amino acid and 1.0 g of phthalic anhydride in a Pyrex test 
tube and immerse the lower part of the tube in an oil bath, which has previously 
been heated to 180-185 °C. Stir the mixture occasionally during the first 10 
minutes and push down the phthalic anhydride which sublimes on the walls into 
the reaction mixture with a glass rod. Leave the mixture undisturbed for 5 
minutes. After 15 minutes, remove the test tube from the bath: when the liquid 
mass solidifies, invert the test tube and scrape out the excess of phthalic anhyd- 
ride on the walls. Recrystallise the residue from 10 per cent ethanol or from 
water. 

1-NAPHTHYLUREIDO ACIDS (or 1-naphthylhydantoic acids) 

Amino acids react in alkaline solution with 1-naphthyl isocyanate to yield the 
sodium salts of the corresponding 1-naphthylureido acids, which remain in solu- 
tion: upon addition of a mineral acid, the ureido acid is precipitated. 

1-C 10 H 7 -NCO + H 2 N-CHR-COf ► l-C 10 H 7 -NH-CO-NH-CHR-COf 

Dissolve 0.5 g of the amino acid in slightly more than the equivalent quantity 
of m sodium hydroxide solution in a stoppered flask. Add a quantity of 1-naph- 
thyl isocyanate just equivalent to the alkali (if the molecular weight of the com- 
pound is not known, use 1 g of the reagent and the corresponding quantity of 
alkali), stopper the flask and shake vigorously until the odour of the reagent has 
disappeared. Filter off any insoluble di- 1 -naphthylurea (resulting from the action 
of water on any excess reagent), and acidify the filtrate to Congo red with dilute 
hydrochloric acid. Filter the naphthylureido acid at the pump, wash it with a 
little cold water and recrystallise from hot water or dilute ethanol. 

The phenylureido acid is prepared similarly, using phenyl isocyanate. The 
latter is more sensitive to water than 1-naphthyl isocyanate and therefore does 
not keep so well. 

The melting points of the derivatives of a number of amino acids are collected 
in Table 10.36. Most a-amino acids decompose on heating so that the melting 
points would be more accurately described as decomposition points: the latter 
vary somewhat with the rate of heating and the figures given are those obtained 
upon rapid heating. 

9.6.24 NITRO COMPOUNDS 

REDUCTION TO THE PRIMARY AMINE 

Add 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid in small portions to a mixture of 
1.0 g of the nitro compound and 3 g of granulated tin contained in a small (say, 
50-ml) flask fitted with a reflux condenser. Shake the flask well to ensure 
thorough mixing during the addition of the acid. After 10 minutes warm under 

1281 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



reflux at 100 °C with vigorous shaking until the nitro compound has dissolved 
and its odour is no longer apparent. (If the nitro compound dissolves slowly, 
add a few ml of ethanol.) Cool the reaction mixture thoroughly and cautiously 
make it alkaline with 20-40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. Isolate the 
liberated amine by steam distillation or by ether extraction. Characterise the 
amine by the preparation of a suitable crystalline derivative (see Primary and 
secondary amines, Section 9.6.21, p. 1273). 

Some aromatic dinitro compounds, e.g. w-dinitrobenzene, may be character- 
ised by partial reduction to the nitroamine. Experimental details using sodium 
polysulphide as the reducing agent are to be found in Expt 6.51. 

OXIDATION OF SIDE CHAINS 

Aromatic nitro compounds that contain a side chain (e.g. nitro derivatives of 
alkylbenzenes) may be oxidised to the corresponding acids either by alkaline 
potassium permanganate (Aromatic hydrocarbons, Section 9.6.3, p. 1238) or, 
preferably, with a sodium dichromate-sulphuric acid mixture in which medium 
the nitro compound is more soluble. 

Mix 1.0 g of the nitro compound with 4g of sodium dichromate and 10 ml of 
water in a 50-ml flask, then attach a reflux condenser to the flask. Add slowly 
and with shaking 7 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. The reaction usually starts 
at once; if it does not, heat the flask gently to initiate the reaction. When the heat 
of reaction subsides, boil the mixture, cautiously at first, under reflux for 20-30 
minutes. Allow to cool, dilute with 30 ml of water and filter off the precipitated 
acid. Purify the crude acid by extraction with sodium carbonate solution, pre- 
cipitation with dilute mineral acid and recrystallisation from hot water, toluene, 
etc. 

NITRATION TO A POLY-NITRO COMPOUND 

Aromatic mononitro compounds may sometimes be characterised by conver- 
sion into the corresponding dinitro or trinitro derivatives. It may be noted that 
many poly-nitro compounds form characteristic addition compounds with 
naphthalene. 

The nitration of an aromatic compound, especially if its composition is 
unknown, must be conducted with great care, preferably behind a safety screen, 
since many aromatic compounds react violently. 

A. Add about 0.5 g of the compound to 2.0 ml of concentrated sulphuric acid. 
Introduce 2.0 ml of concentrated nitric acid drop by drop, with shaking after 
each addition. Attach a small reflux condenser to the flask and heat in a beaker 
of water at 50 °C for 5 minutes. Pour the reaction mixture on to 15 g of crushed 
ice and collect the precipitated solid by suction filtration. Recrystallise from 
dilute ethanol. 

B. Proceed as in A, but use 2.0 ml of fuming nitric acid instead of the concen- 
trated nitric acid, and warm the mixture on a boiling water bath for 5-10 
minutes. 

The physical constants of a number of selected aromatic and alphatic nitro 
compounds are collected in Tables 10.37 and 10.38 respectively. It will be noted 
that a few nitro aromatic esters have been included in the tables.

2,4-DINITROPHENYL SULPHIDES AND SULPHONES 

Thiols react with l-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in alkaline solution to yield crys- 
talline thioethers (2,4-dinitrophenyl sulphides) (1). These sulphides (1) can be 
readily oxidised in glacial acetic acid solution by potassium permanganate to 
the corresponding sulphones (2); the latter exhibit a wide range of melting points 
and are therefore particularly valuable for the characterisation of thiols. (See 
also Expt 5.208.)

Preparation of 2,4-dinitrophenyl sulphides. Dissolve about 0.5 g (or 0.005 mol) of 
the thiol in 10- 15 ml of rectified spirit (or in the minimum volume necessary for 
solution; warming is permissible) and add 2 ml of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution. Mix the resulting solution with a solution of 1 g of l-chloro-2,4- 
dinitrobenzene (CAUTION: see Section 9.6.21, p. 1276) in 5 ml of rectified spirit. 
Reaction may occur immediately with precipitation of the thioether. In any case 
reflux the mixture for 10 minutes on a water bath in order to ensure the com- 
pleteness of the reaction. Filter the hot solution rapidly; allow the solution to 
cool when the sulphide will crystallise out. Recrystallise from ethanol. 

Preparation of the sulphones. Dissolve the 2,4-dinitrophenyl sulphide 
(0.005 mol) in the minimum volume of warm glacial acetic acid and add 3 per 
cent potassium permanganate solution with shaking as fast as decolourisation 
occurs. Use a 50 per cent excess of potassium permanganate: if the sulphide 
tends to precipitate, add more acetic acid. Just decolourise the solution with sul- 
phur dioxide (or with sodium metabisulphite or ethanol) and add 2-3 volumes 
of crushed ice. Filter off the sulphone, dry and recrystallise from ethanol. 

3,5-DINITROTHIOBENZOATES 

Thiols react with 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride in the presence of pyridine as a 
catalyst to yield 3,5-dinitrothiobenzoates (compare Alcohols and polyhydric 
alcohols, Section 9.6.4, p. 1241). 

3,5-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H,-COCl + RSH m _^&gt; 3,5-(N0 2 ) 2 C 6 H,-COSR 

Mix 0.2 g of 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride, 6 drops of the thiol and 1-3 drops of 
pyridine in a test tube, and heat the mixture in a beaker of boiling water until 
fumes of hydrogen chloride cease to appear (10-15 minutes). Add a few drops of 
water, followed by a drop or two of pyridine to eliminate the excess of the 
reagent. The product solidifies upon stirring with a glass rod. Add water, filter 
and recrystallise from dilute ethanol or dilute acetic acid. 

HYDROGEN 3-NITROTHIOPHTHALATES 

Thiols react with 3-nitrophthalic anhydride to yield hydrogen 3-nitrothio- 
phthalates (compare Section 9.6.4, p. 1243).

Mix 3-nitrophthalic anhydride (0.005 mol or 1.0 g) and the thiol (0.0075 mol, 
or 1.0 g if the molecular weight it not known) in a test tube and heat gently over 
a free flame for about 30 seconds. Allow the mixture to cool, and add 0.5 ml of 2 
m sodium hydroxide solution dropwise and with cooling in an ice bath. Then 
add about 0.3 ml of 2 m hydrochloric acid and shake the reaction mixture vigor- 
ously. Collect the solid which separates by suction filtration and dry it upon a 
porous tile. Recrystallise from dilute acetic acid or from aqueous acetone. 

The melting points are determined using a bath preheated to about 100 °C. 
The compounds decompose slightly at the m.p. The melting points of the deriv- 
atives of the more commonly occurring thiols are collected in Table 10.39. 

9.6.26 SULPH0NIC ACIDS 

SULPHONAMIDES 

Mix together l.Og of the dry acid of 1.2g of the anhydrous salt with 2.5 g of 
phosphorus pentachloride and heat under a reflux condenser in an oil bath at 
150°C for 30 minutes. Cool the mixture, add 20 ml of dry benzene (CAUTION), 
warm in a steam bath (fume cupboard) and stir the solid mass well to extract the 
sulphonyl chloride: filter.* Add the benzene solution slowly and with stirring to 
10 ml of concentrated ammonia solution. If the sulphonamide precipitates, 
separate it by filtration; if no solid is obtained, evaporate the benzene on a steam 
bath. Wash the sulphonamide with a little cold water, and recrystallise from 
water, aqueous ethanol or ethanol to constant m.p. 

The procedure is not usually applicable to aminosulphonic acids owing to the 
interaction between the amino group and the phosphorus pentachloride. If, 
however, the chlorosulphonic acid is prepared by diazotisation and treatment 
with a solution of cuprous chloride in hydrochloric acid, the crystalline chloro- 
sulphonamide and chlorosulphonanilide may be obtained in the usual way. 
With some compounds, the amino group may be protected by acetylation. Sul- 
phonic acids derived from a phenol or naphthol cannot be converted into the 
sulphonyl chlorides by the phosphorus pentachloride method. 

The sulphonanilides may be prepared by either of the following methods: 

1. Reflux the solution of the sulphonyl chloride in benzene obtained as above, 
with 2.5 g of aniline for 1 hour. Concentrate the benzene solution to half its 
volume and cool in ice. Collect the solid which separates on a filter, wash with 
hot water and recrystallise from ethanol or dilute ethanol. 

2. Treat the crude sulphonyl chloride (isolated by evaporating the solvent after 
extraction with benzene (or ether or chloroform) as above) with 1 g of p-tolui- 
dine and 30 ml of c. 2 m sodium hydroxide solution. Shake for 10-15 minutes. 

* The sulphonyl chloride may be isolated by evaporating the benzene solution and recrystallising 
the residue from chloroform-light petroleum (b.p. 40-60 °C) or toluene-light petroleum (b.p. 
40-60 °C).

phthalein indicator and neutralise with c. m sodium hydroxide solution. Then 
add 2-3 drops of 0.1 m hydrochloric acid to ensure that the solution is almost

To a solution of 0.5 g of the salt in 5 ml of water and 2-3 drops of 0.1 m hydro-

cold, 15 per cent aqueous solution of S-benzylisothiouronium chloride (if the 
molecular weight of the compound is not known, use a solution of 1 g of the 
reagent in 5 ml of water), and cool in ice. Filter off the crystalline derivative and 
recrystallise it from 5 per cent ethanol. 

SULPHONACETAMIDES 

Sulphonacetamides are derivatives of sulphonamides (Section 9.6.27, p. 1286), 
but since the latter are readily prepared from the sulphonic acids or their salts, 
sulphonacetamides may be employed for the characterisation of sulphonic acids; 
for this reason they are included in this Section. 

Sulphonamides upon heating with acetyl chloride are converted into the N- 
acetyl derivatives or sulphonacetamides: 

Ar-S0 2 NHR + Me-COCl ^^&gt; Ar-S0 2 N(R)-COMe (R = Horalkyl) 

The sulphonacetamides (R=H) are freely soluble in sodium hydrogen car- 
bonate solution thus rendering purification facile. Sulphonacetamides are 
moderately strong acids, and can generally be titrated in aqueous or aqueous- 
alcoholic solution with phenolphthalein as indicator. The acidic properties of 
sulphonacetamides may be used to effect a separation of a sulphonamide from an 
N-alkylsulphonamide. Acetylation of such a mixture gives a sulphonacetamide 
and an Af-alkylsulphonacetamide, of which only the former is soluble in sodium 
hydrogen carbonate solution. Both sulphonacetamides and Af-alkylsulphon- 
acetamides are readily hydrolysed by boiling with excess of 5 per cent potassium 
hydroxide solution for about 1 hour, followed by acidification with dilute hydro- 
chloric acid, giving the corresponding sulphonamides and Af-alkylsulphon- 
amides respectively. 

Reflux 1 g of the sulphonamide with 2.5 ml of acetyl chloride for 30 minutes; if 
solution is not complete within 5 minutes, add up to 2.5 ml of glacial acetic acid. 
Remove the excess of acetyl chloride by distillation on a water bath, and pour 
the cold reaction mixture into water. Collect the product, wash with water and 
dissolve it in warm sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. Acidify the filtered 
solution with glacial acetic acid; filter off the precipitated sulphonacetamide and 
recrystallise it from aqueous ethanol. 



1285 



9.6 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



p-TOLUIDINE SALTS OF SULPHONIC ACIDS 

These are prepared by the interaction of the sulphonic acid or its sodium salt 
with p-toluidine hydrochloride in aqueous solution: 

R-S0 3 ®Na® +p-Me-C 6 H 4 -NH 2 i^&gt; (p-Me-C 6 H 4 NH,)®(R-S0 3 )® + NaCl 

Dissolve 1 .0 g of the alkali metal salt of the sulphonic acid in the minimum 
volume of hot water and add 0.5 g of p-toluidine and 2 ml of concentrated hydro- 
chloric acid. If a solid separates or the p-toluidine does not dissolve completely, 
add more hot water and a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid until a 
clear solution is obtained at the boiling point. Cool the solution; if crystallis- 
ation does not occur immediately, 'scratch' the walls of the test tube to induce 
crystallisation. Collect the product by suction filtration, and recrystallise it from 
hot water containing a drop of concentrated hydrochloric acid, or from dilute 
ethanol. 

The melting points of the derivatives of a number of selected sulphonic acids 
are collected in Table 10.40; the melting points of the corresponding sulphonyl 
chlorides are included for purposes of reference. The acids do not possess sharp 
melting points; the sulphonic acids are therefore arranged in groups of related 
compounds. In a subsidiary Table (10.40A), a number of sulphonic acids are 
arranged in the order of increasing melting points of the S-benzyliso- 
thiouronium salts. 

9.6.27 SULPHONAMIDES 

HYDROLYSIS 

Sulphonamides are most readily identified by hydrolysis with 80 per cent sul- 
phuric acid (for experimental details see p. 1230). 

R'-S0 2 NHR 2 + H,0® &gt; R'-SOjH + R 2 -NH, 

Ar-S0 2 NHR + H 3 0® &gt; Ar-S0 3 H + R-NH 3 

Ar-SO,NR'R 2 + H 3 0® &gt; Ar-SO,H + R'R 2 NH 2 

The amine is liberated by the addition of alkali and then characterised by a suit- 
able derivative; the sulphonic acid may then be recovered as the sodium salt and 
converted into a suitable crystalline derivative, e.g. the S-benzylisothiouronium 
salt. 

XANTHYLSULPHONAMIDES 

Primary sulphonamides (R-S0 2 NH 2 ) may be most simply characterised by 
reaction with xanthhydrol to yield the corresponding Af-xanthylsulphonamides 
(cf. Primary amides, Section 9.6.18, p. 1270). Dissolve 0.25 g of xanthhydrol and 
0.25 g of the primary sulphonamide in 10 ml of glacial acetic acid. Shake for 2-3 
minutes at the laboratory temperature and allow to stand for 60-90 minutes. 
Filter off the derivative, recrystallise it from dioxane-water (3:1) and dry at 
room temperature. 

SULPHONACETAMIDES 

Sulphonamides may also be characterised as sulphonacetamides: for experi- 
mental details see Section 9.6.26, above). 

1286 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 3.7 



The melting points of sulphonamides, both aliphatic and aromatic, together 
with the melting points of some Af-xanthylsulphonamides and sulphonacet- 
amides are collected in Tables 10.41 and 10.40. 



9.7 SEPARATION OF MIXTURES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 

9.7.1 INTRODUCTION 

The organic chemist is frequently faced with the task of separating mixtures of 
compounds. Since few organic reactions give a single product, this commonly 
occurs in the work-up stage of a reaction when it is desired to isolate a single 
pure compound from a mixture which may contain unreacted starting materials 
and reagents, inorganic material produced from reagents, and expected and un- 
expected by-products (Section 2.18). The chemist may also need to separate 
mixtures of naturally occurring substances obtained from plant or animal 
sources. Earlier chapters have illustrated many of the techniques used by the 
organic chemist to separate mixtures as part of a reaction work-up. The particu- 
lar method used will depend on the chemical and physical properties of the sub- 
stances involved. A simple, standard procedure is as follows. Pour the reaction 
mixture into water; extract the organic material with a low-boiling solvent such 
as ether or dichloromethane by shaking in a separatory funnel with several suc- 
cessive portions of the solvent; combine the organic solutions and dry with a 
suitable drying agent (Section 2.23); remove the solvent by distillation or by 
using a rotary evaporator; purify the residual organic product by distillation 
(Section 2.24) or recrystallisation (Section 2.20). The reaction work-up pro- 
cedure may be modified to take advantage of particular physical or chemical 
properties of one or more components of the mixture, such as volatility, solubil- 
ity characteristics and acidic or basic properties, and some of these methods are 
described in this section. The mixture may be examined by one or more chroma- 
tographic methods (Section 2.31), commonly thin-layer chromatography (t.l.c), 
gas-liquid chromatography (g.l.c.) or high performance liquid chromatography 
to determine the number of components. The mixture may also be investigated 
by spectroscopic techniques (Section 9.4) and chemical methods (Section 9.5) to 
give an indication of the nature of the components. In the light of all this in- 
formation the chemist can decide on the appropriate method of separation. The 
greater the similarity in chemical and physical properties, the more challenging 
does the task of separation become. Examples are included in earlier chapters of 
the separation of structural isomers (for example: toluene-p- and o-sulphonyl 
chlorides, Expt 6.41; o- and p-hydroxypropiophenones, Expt 6.107; o- and p- 
hydroxybenzaldehydes, Expt 6.116; 3- and 4-nitrophthalic acids, Expt 6 162) 
geometric isomers (for example, (£)- and (Z)-azobenzenes, Section 2.31.2, p' 
223) and optical isomers (for example: ( ± )-a-methylbenzylamine, Expt 5 219- 
(±)-octan-2-ol, Expt 5.220; and (±)-alanine, Expt 5.221). 

In order to gain an understanding of the principles involved and of the 
variety of methods which may be employed, it can be useful practice for the 
organic chemistry student to carry out exercises on the investigation and separa- 
tion of given mixtures. It is impossible, however, to give a set of procedures 
which will be applicable, without modification, to the great variety of combina- 
tions which may be encountered. Advantage should be taken of any facts which 

1287 



9.7 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



have emerged in the preliminary examination and to adapt, if necessary, the 
general schemes given below to the mixture under examination. The preliminary 
examination is therefore of fundamental importance. 

Broadly speaking, the separation of the components of mixtures may be 
divided into three main groups. 

SEPARATIONS BASED UPON DIFFERENCES IN THE CHEMICAL 
PROPERTIES OF THE COMPONENTS 

A mixture of toluene and aniline may be separated by extraction with dilute 
hydrochloric acid: the aniline passes into the aqueous layer in the form of the 
salt, aniline hydrochloride, and may be recovered by neutralisation. Similarly, a 
mixture of phenol and toluene may be separated by treatment with dilute 
sodium hydroxide. The above examples are, of course, simple applications of the 
fact that the various components fall into different solubility groups (compare 
Section 9.2). Another example is the separation of a mixture of dibutyl ether and 
chlorobenzene: concentrated sulphuric acid dissolves only the dibutyl ether and 
it may be recovered from solution by dilution with water. With some classes of 
compounds, e.g. unsaturated compounds, concentrated sulphuric acid leads to 
polymerisation, sulphonation, etc., so that the original component cannot be re- 
covered unchanged: this solvent, therefore, possesses limited application. 

Phenols may be separated from acids (for example, o-cresol from benzoic 
acid) by a dilute solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate: the weakly acidic phe- 
nols (and also enols) are not converted into salts by this reagent and may be 
removed by ether extraction or by other means; the acids pass into solution as 
the sodium salts and may be recovered after acidification. For experimental 
details see Sections 2.22 and 9.6.17, p. 1266. 

Mixtures of primary, secondary and tertiary amines can usually be separated 
by Hinsberg's method. This is based on the fact that reaction with benzene- 
sulphonyl (or toluene-p-sulphonyl) chloride converts primary amines into 
alkali-soluble sulphonamides, secondary amines into alkali-insoluble sulphon- 
amides and leaves tertiary amines unaffected. 

Ph-S0 2 Cl + H 2 N-R ^i&gt; [Ph-SO,N-R]Na® (water-soluble) 
-^ Ph-S0 2 NH-R (water-insoluble) 



Ph-S0 2 Cl + NHR 2 ^^&gt; Ph-S0 2 NR 2 (insoluble in alkali) 

The following experimental details illustrate how the Hinsberg separation of 
amines may be carried out in practice. 

Treat 2.0 g of the mixture of amines with 40 ml of 10 per cent of sodium 
hydroxide solution and add 4g (3 ml) of benzenesulphonyl chloride (or 4g of 
toluene-p-sulphonyl chloride) in small portions. Warm on a water bath to com- 
plete the reaction. Acidify the alkaline solution with dilute hydrochloric acid 
when the sulphonamides of the primary and secondary amines are precipitated. 
Filter off the solid and wash it with a little cold water; the tertiary amine will be 
present in the filtrate. To convert any disulphonamide that may have been 
formed from the primary amine into the sulphonamide, boil the solid under 
reflux with 2.0 g of sodium dissolved in 40 ml of absolute ethanol for 30 minutes. 
Dilute with a little water and distil off the alcohol: filter off the precipitate of the 
sulphonamide of the secondary amine. Acidify the filtrate with dilute hydro- 

1288 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.7 



chloric acid to precipitate the derivative of the primary amine. Recrystallise the 
respective derivatives from ethanol or from dilute ethanol. 

Aldehydes, e.g. benzaldehyde, may be separated from liquid hydrocarbons 
and other neutral, water-insoluble liquid compounds by shaking with a solution 
of sodium metabisulphite: the aldehyde forms a solid bisulphite compound, 
which may be filtered off and decomposed with dilute acid or with sodium bi- 
carbonate solution in order to recover the aldehyde. 

A valuable method of separating ketones from other neutral and water- 
insoluble compounds utilises the Girard-T reagent. (Section 4.2.30, p. 434). It 
reacts with the carbonyl compound to yield another quaternary ammonium 
salt: 

R'R 2 CO + [Me,N-CH 2 -CO-NH-NH 2 ]Cl e &gt;■ 

[Me,N-CH 2 -CO-NH-N=CR'R 2 ]Cl e + H 2 

The latter is a polar compound and is therefore soluble in water. Extraction with 
ether removes the water-insoluble compounds, leaving the salt in the aqueous 
layer. The ketone is easily regenerated by hydrolysis with dilute hydrochloric 
acid (p. 434). 

SEPARATIONS BASED UPON DIFFERENCES IN THE 
VOLATILITIES OF THE COMPONENTS IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION 

This procedure is generally employed for the water-soluble compounds, and 
may also be applied to mixtures in which one of the components is slightly 
soluble in water. The water-soluble compounds include the lower members of 
the homologous series of alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, acids, esters, amines and 
nitriles; compounds containing two or more hydroxyl or amino groups, 
hydroxy-, amino-, di- and poly-basic acids, sulphonic acids and salts. The com- 
pounds with one functional group are usually volatile in steam and distil with 
the water: compounds with two or more functional groups (amino, hydroxyl or 
carboxyl) are not generally steam-volatile. The stable salts of steam-volatile 
bases and acids may be decomposed by a stronger non-volatile mineral acid 
(sulphuric acid or phosphoric acid) or base (sodium or potassium hydroxide), 
and the organic base or acid separated by steam distillation from the aqueous 
solution or suspension. The salts of weaker bases and acids (e.g. the amine or 
ammonium salts of carboxylic acids and the alkali metal salts of some phenols) 
are sufficiently hydrolysed by boiling water to permit the basic or acidic com- 
pound to distil with the water. It should be noted that sulphonic acids and their 
salts are not volatile in steam. The only disadvantage of this procedure is that 
certain compounds may decompose or polymerise or otherwise undergo change 
under the influence of aqueous alkali or acid at 100 °C, and this fact must be 
borne in mind when the method is employed. Thus sugars are decomposed by 
alkali; these may sometimes be isolated by evaporation of the solvent at pH 7, 
preferably under diminished pressure. 

The essential basis of the scheme for the separation of water-soluble com- 
pounds is, therefore, distillation of (a) an aqueous solution of the mixture, (b) an 
alkaline (with sodium hydroxide) solution of the mixture and (c) an acidic (with 
sulphuric or phosphoric acid) solution of the mixture. The residue will contain 
the non-volatile components, which must be separated from inorganic salts and 
from each other by any suitable process. 

1289 



9.7 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



The following are examples of the above procedure. A mixture of diethyl- 
amine and butan-1-ol may be separated by adding sufficient dilute sulphuric 
acid to neutralise the base: steam distillation will remove the alcohol. The amine 
can be recovered by adding sodium hydroxide to the residue and repeating the 
distillation. A mixture of diethyl ketone and acetic acid may be treated with suf- 
ficient dilute sodium hydroxide solution to transform the acid into sodium 
acetate and distilling the aqueous mixture. The ketone will pass over in the 
steam and the non-volatile, stable salt will remain in the flask. Acidification with 
dilute sulphuric acid liberates acetic acid, which can be isolated by steam distil- 
lation or by extraction. 

SEPARATIONS BASED UPON DIFFERENCES IN THE PHYSICAL 
PROPERTIES OF THE COMPONENTS 

When the separation procedures described in detail above are unsatisfact- 
ory for the separation of a mixture of organic compounds, purely physical 
methods may be employed. Thus a mixture of volatile liquids may be fraction- 
ally distilled (compare Section 2.26); or a mixture of non- volatile solids may fre- 
quently be separated by making use of the differences in solubilities in inert 
solvents. The progress of such separations may be monitored by application of 
the various chromatographic techniques detailed in Section 2.3 1, or indeed these 
techniques may be employed on the preparative scale for effecting the separation 
itself (e.g. flash chromatography, p. 217). The techniques of counter current dis- 
tribution, fractional crystallisation or fractional sublimation (Section 2.21) may 
also be employed where appropriate. 

9.7.2 PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF A MIXTURE 

LIQUID MIXTURES 

Physical properties. Examine the mixture with regard to odour, viscosity and 

colour. 

Solubility in water. Transfer 1.0 ml of the mixture by means of a calibrated 
dropper or a small pipette into a small graduated test tube: add 1 ml of water 
and shake. Observe whether there is complete or partial solution and if there is 
any sign of chemical reaction. If solution is not complete, add more water (in 
1 ml portions) and note (a) if the mixture dissolves completely, and (b) if a por- 
tion is insoluble and, if so, whether it is heavier or lighter than the aqueous layer. 
If an emulsion is formed, it may be assumed that at least one component of the 
mixture is insoluble in water and at least one component is soluble. Test the 
aqueous layer obtained with litmus and with phenolphthalein: if there is an acid 
reaction, test also with 5 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. 

Presence or absence of water. Determine the absence or presence of water in the 
mixture by one or more of the following tests: 

1. Investigate its miscibility with ether or with toluene. 

2. Observe its action upon anhydrous copper(n) sulphate. 

3. Distil a small portion and note the b.p. and properties of the distillate. 

4. Distil 3 ml of the mixture with 3 ml of dry toluene from a dry 10-ml distilling 
flask. Collect 2 ml of the distillate and dilute it with 5 ml of dry toluene; the 



1290 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.7 



formation of two layers or of distinct drops suspended in the toluene indicates 
the presence of water. 

Behaviour upon distillation. If the original mixture is not an aqueous solution, 
place 5 ml (or 10ml) of it in a 10-ml (or 25-ml) flask set for downward distilla- 
tion, immerse the latter in a small beaker of cold water and gradually heat to 
boiling. Observe the b.p. of any liquid which passes over and set it aside for sub- 
sequent examination. Determine the water-solubility of any residue. If it dis- 
solves in water, examine it by Table 9.4; if insoluble in water, apply Table 9.3 (p. 
1294 and p. 1296 respectively). 

Test for elements. If the mixture is an aqueous solution, evaporate a small por- 
tion (c. 1 ml) to dryness upon platinum foil or in a small crucible. Use a portion 
of the residue to test for elements (Section 9.3) and another portion for the 
Ignition test, below. 

If no water is present in the mixture, use it directly in the tests for elements. 

Ignition test. Place 0. 1-0.2 g of the mixture on a porcelain crucible cover: heat 
gently at first over a small flame and finally ignite strongly. Observe: 

1. The inflammability and nature of the flame (e.g. smoky or otherwise). 

2. Whether a residue is left after ignition; moisten with hydrochloric acid and test 

with a platinum wire. 

Spectroscopic investigation. See Section 9.4. 

Miscellaneous tests. Treat 1 ml of the mixture with 5 per cent sodium hydroxide 
solution until strongly alkaline: note whether an oil or solid separates, whether 
any ammonia is evolved and any colour changes which occur. Heat to boiling 
and cool: compare odour with that of the original mixture (a change in odour 
may indicate the presence of esters). Add dilute hydrochloric acid and observe 
the result. 

Treat 1 ml of the mixture with dilute hydrochloric acid until strongly acid. 
Note any evolution of gas or the separation of a solid. Add dilute sodium 
hydroxide solution and observe the effect. 

Miscellaneous class reactions. (Section 9.5.) Determine the effect of the following 
class reagents upon small portions of the original mixture: (i) bromine in dichloro- 
methane solution; (ii) potassium permanganate solution; (iii) alcoholic 
silver nitrate solution; (iv) 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent; (v) Schiffs 
reagent; (vi) acetyl chloride; (vii) benzoyl chloride (in the presence of aqueous 
sodium hydroxide); (viii) sodium (only if water is absent); (ix) iron(ra) chloride 
solution; and (x) bromine water. 

SOLID MIXTURES 

Physical properties. Observe the colour, odour and crystalline form. Examine 

with a lens or a microscope, if available. 

Solubility in water. Determine the solubility of 1.0 g of the sample in water. If in 
doubt as to whether a portion of the mixture dissolves, remove the supernatant 
liquid with a dropper and evaporate to dryness on a water bath. Determine the 
reaction of the aqueous solution or suspension to litmus and to phenol- 
phthalein. 



1291 



S.7 PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Test for elements, Section 9.3. 

Ignition test. Place 0. 1 g-0.2 g of the mixture upon a porcelain crucible cover or 

upon a piece of platinum foil; heat gently at first and finally ignite strongly. 

Note: 

1. Whether the mixture melts and if decomposition occurs. 

2. The flammability and the nature of the flame (e.g. if smoky or otherwise). 

3. Whether a residue is obtained after ignition (moisten with hydrochloric acid 
and test with a platinum wire). 

Spectroscopic examination. See Section 9.4. 

Miscellaneous tests. Test the solubility behaviour of 0.5-1 g of the mixture to 5 
per cent sodium hydroxide solution, 5 per cent sodium hydrogen carbonate 
solution and to 5 per cent hydrochloric acid (for details, see under Liquid mix- 
tures). 

Miscellaneous class reactions. (Section 9.5.) Determine the effect of the following 
class reagents upon small portions of the original mixture (for some of the tests 
an aqueous solution or suspension may be used): (i) bromine in dichloro- 
methane solution; (ii) potassium permanganate solution; (iii) alcoholic silver 
nitrate solution; (iv) 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent; (v) Schiffs reagent; 
(vi) acetyl chloride; (vii) benzoyl chloride (in the presence of aqueous sodium 
hydroxide); (viii) iron(m) chloride solution; and (ix) bromine water. 

A careful consideration of the results of the above tests will provide much use- 
ful information and will indicate which of the following general procedures 
should be applied and the modifications which are necessary. Thus if nitrogen is 
absent, it is doubtful whether the separation for bases would be necessary. 

9.7.3 SEPARATION OF WATER-INSOLUBLE MIXTURES 

If the water-insoluble mixture is a liquid, evaporate a small sample (say, 4 ml) in 
an evaporating dish on a water bath in order to determine the amount of volatile 
components, if any. If the solvent distils at the temperature of the boiling water 
bath, it is advisable to distil off this solvent on a water bath and to replace it by 
ether. 

Place 15-20 ml of the liquid mixture in a 50-ml distilling flask arranged for 
distillation, and heat the flask on a boiling water bath until no more liquid 
passes over: redistil the distillate and if it is a single substance, identify it in the 
usual manner. Dissolve the residue (R) in ether and employ the same propor- 
tions as given for a solid mixture. 

STEP 1. EXTRACTION AND SEPARATION OF THE ACIDIC 
COMPONENTS 

Shake 5-10 g of the solid mixture (or of the residue R obtained after the removal 
of the solvent on a water bath) with 50 ml of pure ether, or other appropriate 
water-immiscible solvent (e.g. petroleum, dichloromethane, etc.). If there is a 
residue, separate it by filtration, preferably through a sintered glass funnel, wash 
it with a little ether and examine it appropriately. Shake the resulting ethereal 
solution in a small separatory funnel with 15 ml portions of 5 per cent aqueous 
sodium hydroxide solution until all the acidic components have been removed. 
Three portions of alkali are usually sufficient. Set aside the residual ethereal 

1292 



INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.7 



solution (£1) for Step 2. Combine the sodium hydroxide extracts and wash the 
resulting mixture with 15-20 ml of ether; discard these washings. Render the 
alkaline extract acid to litmus with dilute sulphuric acid and then add excess of 
solid sodium hydrogen carbonate. Alternatively treat the sodium hydroxide 
extract with Cardice until no more is absorbed. 

Separate any phenolic or enolic compounds which may be present by extract- 
ing the sodium hydrogen carbonate solution with two 20 ml portions of ether; 
remove the ether from the extract and examine any residue for phenols (or 
enols). 

Strongly acidify the residual sodium hydrogen carbonate solution to Congo 
red with dilute sulphuric acid. If a solid acid forms, filter. Extract the filtrate or 
the acidified solution with two 20 ml portions of ether: keep the aqueous solu- 
tion (A). Distil off the ether, and add the residual acid (if a solid) to the solid 
separated by filtration. Identify the acid. 

Now distil the filtrate (A) and collect the distillate as long as it is acid to 
litmus. Should any solid separate out in the distilling flask during the distilla- 
tion, add more water to dissolve it. Set aside the residue (B) in the flask. Identify 
the volatile acid in the distillate. A simple method is to just neutralise it with 
sodium hydroxide solution, evaporate to dryness and convert the residual 
sodium salt into the S-benzylisothiouronium salt (Section 9.6.15, p. 1264). 

The residue (B) in the distilling flask may still contain a water-soluble, non- 
volatile acid. Cool the acid solution, neutralise it with dilute sodium hydroxide 
solution to Congo red and evaporate to dryness on a water bath under reduced 
pressure (water pump). Heat a little of the residual salt (C) upon the tip of a 
nickel spatula in a Bunsen flame and observe whether any charring takes place. 
If charring occurs, thus indicating the presence of organic matter, extract the 
solid residue with 25 ml portions of hot absolute ethanol. Evaporate the ethano- 
lic extract and identify the material which remains. The residue (C) contains the 
sodium salt of a water-soluble, non-volatile acid, which may be characterised as 
the S-benzylisothiouronium salt. 

STEP 2. EXTRACTION OF THE BASIC COMPONENTS 

Extract the ethereal solution (£,) with 15 ml portions of 5 per cent hydrochloric 
acid until all the basic components have been removed: two or three portions of 
acid are usually sufficient. Preserve the residual ethereal solution (E 2 ) for the 
separation of the neutral components. Wash the combined acid extracts with 
15-20 ml of ether: discard the ether extract as in Step J. Make the acid extract 
alkaline with 10-20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution: if any basic component 
separates, extract it with ether, evaporate the ether and characterise the residue. 
If a water-soluble base is also present, it may be recognised by its characteristic 
ammoniacal odour; it may be isolated from the solution remaining after the 
separation of the insoluble base by ether extraction by distilling the aqueous 
solution as long as the distillate is alkaline to litmus. Identify the base with the 
aid of phenyl isothiocyanate (compare Section 9.6.21, p. 1277) or by other means. 

STEP 3. THE NEUTRAL COMPONENTS 

The ethereal solution (E 2 ) remaining after the acid extracton of Step 2 should 
contain only the neutral compounds of solubility groups 5, 6 and 7 (see Table 
9.1). Dry it with a little magnesium sulphate, and distil off the ether. If a residue 
is obtained, neutral compounds are present in the mixture. Test a portion of this

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.7 



with respect to its solubility in concentrated sulphuric acid; if it dissolves in the 
acid, pour the solution slowly and cautiously into ice-water and note whether 
any compound is recovered. Examine the main residue for homogeneity and if it 
is a mixture devise procedures, based for example upon differences in volatility, 
solubility in inert solvents, reaction with hydrolytic and other reagents, to separ- 
ate the components. 

The above procedure for water-insoluble mixtures is shown, in outline, in 
tabular form in Table 9.3. If the mixture is a liquid, the volatile solvent is 
assumed to have been removed. 

9.7.4 SEPARATION OF WATER-SOLUBLE MIXTURES 

A water-soluble mixture may be in the form of a mixture of water-soluble solids 
or in the form of a liquid. The liquid mixtures are frequently aqueous solutions. 
The preliminary examination of a liquid mixture (p. 1290) will indicate whether a 
volatile solvent (i.e. removable on a boiling water bath) is present. If a volatile 
solvent is present, distil 20 g of the mixture from a water bath until no more 
liquid passes over: set aside the volatile solvent for identification. Dissolve the 
residue (R) in water as detailed below for a mixture of solids. 

STEP 1. DISTILLATION FROM ACID SOLUTION AND THE 
SEPARATION OF THE VOLATILE ACIDIC AND NEUTRAL 
COMPOUNDS 

Dissolve 6-10 g of a solid mixture in 50-75 ml of water, for a liquid mixture, use 
6-10 g of the residue (R) (non-volatile from a boiling water bath) and dilute with 
50-75 ml of water: for an aqueous solution use sufficient of it to contain 6-10 g of 
the dissolved components and dilute, if necessary, to 50-75 ml. Acidify the solu- 
tion with sufficient 20 per cent sulphuric acid to decompose the salts of all the 
acidic components and to ensure the presence of a slight excess of acid: many 
organic acids give an acid reaction with Congo red, hence it is necessary to add 
the sulphuric acid somewhat beyond the point at which the mixture is acid to 
this indicator. If an insoluble acidic component separates, filter it off and identify 
it. Distil the acid solution so long as the distillate appears turbid, or is acid to 
litmus, or until 100- 150 ml are collected: in the last case, add more water to the 
contents of the distilling flask if the volume has been reduced below one-fourth 
of the original volume. Keep the residue (R,) in the distilling flask for Step 2. 

The distillate may contain volatile neutral compounds as well as volatile 
acids and phenols. Add a slight excess of 10-20 per cent sodium hydroxide solu- 
tion to this distillate and distil until it is judged that all volatile organic com- 
pounds have passed over into the distillate. If necessary, the determination of the 
refractive index of the distillate or the application of specific chemical tests (e.g. 
for carbonyl compounds use the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine reagent) should be 
used to confirm completion of distillation. Keep this distillate (S,) for Step 4. 

Cool the alkaline solution resulting from the distillation of the volatile neu- 
tral compounds, make it acid to litmus with dilute sulphuric acid and add an 
excess of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate. Extract this hydrogen carbonate 
solution with two 20 ml portions of ether; remove the ether from the combined 
ether extracts and identify the residual phenol (or enol). Then acidify the hydro- 
gen carbonate solution cautiously with dilute sulphuric acid; if an acidic com- 
pound separates, remove it by two extractions with 20 ml portions of ether; if the

INVESTIGATION AND CHARACTERISATION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 9.7 



acidified solution remains clear, distil and collect any water-soluble, volatile acid 
in the distillate. Characterise the acid as described in Section 9.6.15, p. 1261. 

STEP 2. DISTILLATION FROM ALKALINE SOLUTION 

Treat the solution (Ri) remaining in the distilling flask after the volatile acidic 
and neutral compounds have been removed with 10-20 per cent sodium hydrox- 
ide solution until distinctly alkaline. If a solid separates, filter it off and identify 
it. Distil the alkaline solution until no more volatile bases pass over (distillate no 
longer turbid, or not basic to litmus: water-soluble bases also possess character- 
istic odours): add more water to the contents of the flask if the solution becomes 
too concentrated during this distillation. [Set aside the solution in the distilling 
flask (S 2 ) for Step 3.] If the volatile basic compounds are insoluble in water, 
remove them by extraction with two 20 ml portions of ether, and identify the 
bases (compare Sections 9.6.21, p. 1273 and 9.6.22, p. 1278) after evaporation of 
the ether. The water-soluble amines may be identified with phenyl isothiocyanate: 
it is best to concentrate the bases by redistilling and collecting the first half of 
the distillate separately. 

STEP 3. THE NON-STEAM-VOLATILE COMPOUNDS 

The alkaline solution (S 2 ) remaining in the distilling flask from Step 2 may con- 
tain water-soluble, non-volatile acidic, basic or neutral compounds. Add dilute 
sulphuric acid until the solution is just acid to Congo red, evaporate to dryness 
and extract the residual solid with boiling absolute ethanol: extraction is com- 
plete when the undissolved salt exhibits no sign of charring when heated on a 
metal spatula in the Bunsen flame. Evaporate the alcoholic solution to dryness 
and identify the residue. 

STEP 4. THE STEAM-VOLATILE NEUTRAL COMPOUNDS 

The solution (Si) containing water-soluble neutral compounds obtained in Step 
1 is usually very dilute. It is advisable to concentrate it by distillation until about 
one-third to one half of the original volume is collected as distillate; the process 
may be repeated if necessary. It is frequently possible to salt out the neutral com- 
ponents from the concentrated distillate by saturating it with solid potassium 
carbonate. If a layer of neutral compound makes its appearance, remove it. 
Treat this upper layer (which usually contains much water) with solid anhyd- 
rous potassium carbonate: if another aqueous layer forms, separate the upper 
organic layer and add more anhydrous potassium carbonate to it. Identify the 
neutral compound. 

Note. Some neutral compounds (e.g. methanol) cannot be salted out with potassium car- 
bonate: distillation of the saturated aqueous potassium carbonate solution frequently 
yields the organic compound in a comparatively pure state, or at least in sufficiently con- 
centrated a form to enable certain derivatives to be prepared. 

The above procedure for the separation of a water-soluble mixture is sum- 
marised in Table 9.4. 



1297 



CHAPTER 10 

PHYSICAL CONSTANTS OF ORGANIC 
COMPOUNDS 



TABLES OF DERIVATIVES 

The tables in this chapter contain lists of the more common members of the 
various classes of organic compounds arranged, as far as possible, in the order of 
increasing boiling points or melting points, together with the melting points of 
selected derivatives. Some of the tables are subdivided: thus in Table 10.6, 
Phenols, the additional sub-headings are Halogeno-phenols and Nitro-phenols. 
This subdivision renders the tables less cumbersome and facilitates their use. 

In describing compounds in the literature, the range of a certain number of 
degrees is usually recorded for the boiling point or the melting point; the highest 
point of the boiling point or the melting point range is listed in the tables and the 
value is given to the nearest whole degree. For those compounds the author has 
purified or prepared, the actual observed boiling point or melting point is 
recorded. Densities are given for a temperature of 20 °C referred to water at 4 °C 
unless otherwise indicated. Refractive indices are recorded for the sodium D line 
at 20 °C. It must be remembered that the value obtained for a melting point 
depends upon the observer and upon the method which was used in the deter- 
mination: this often accounts for the slightly different values found in the litera- 
ture for the same compound. 

Reference should be made to Section 2.3.4, p. 44, for those classes of com- 
pounds which are potentially carcinogenic; those marked C should be handled 
with great caution; some are subject to legal control in Great Britain or the USA 
or both.

Table 10.25 Aliphatic esters 

It is considered that the table will be of greatest use if the esters are subdivided under the various 
acids rather than arranged in order of increasing b.p. or m.p. irrespective of the nature of the carb- 
oxylic acid. The latter procedure leads to an unwieldy, heterogeneous table which has relatively little 
pedagogic or, indeed, practical value.

TABLES OF DERIVATIVES 10 



Table 10.26 Aromatic esters 

It is considered that the table will be of greatest use if the esters are in the main subdivided under the 
various acids rather than be arranged in order of increasing b.p. or m.p. irrespective of the nature of 
the carboxylic acid. The latter procedure leads to an unwieldy, heterogeneous table which has relat- 
ively little pedagogic or, indeed, practical value.

* These melting points are probably better described as decomposition points and their values will 
depend somewhat upon the rate of heating. Many of the naturally-occurring amino acids are (-)- 
rotatory.

10 PHYSICAL CONSTANTS OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS 



Table 10.40 Sulphonic acids 

Note. Aromatic sulphonic acids are usually hygroscopic solids and do not generally have sharp 
melting points: they are frequently supplied in the form of their sodium (or other metal) salts. It is 
therefore not possible to classify them in order of increasing melting points. In this table

APPENDIX 1 

THE LITERATURE OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



A1.1 INTRODUCTION 

The annual volume of published chemical papers has increased roughly five-fold 
over the past forty years. This volume of information imposes two sorts of tasks 
on the organic chemist. Firstly, to keep abreast of developments in aspects of the 
subject which are of particular interest by sampling the flow of published in- 
formation as it appears, and secondly, to retrieve information of interest from 
the accumulation of published material. The information which is to be 
retrieved may be the physical properties of a specific compound or a reliable 
method for its preparation, a comprehensive list of preparative methods, a sur- 
vey of recent work on a particular group of compounds, etc. Although some 
chemists, particularly those in large pharmaceutical companies, may have access 
to the services of information scientists, many still need to maintain current 
awareness and to carry out literature searches themselves, and all organic 
chemists need to be familiar with the nature of the chemical literature. Compu- 
terised methods for storage and retrieval of information are becoming increas- 
ingly common and accessible to the individual chemist and this trend is likely to 
continue. Given access to a good chemical library with a range of on-line facil- 
ities the experienced chemist should be able to obtain the information required 
without too much difficulty. The principal sources of such information are 
described in this appendix. The coverage is necessarily selective and readers who 
require a more detailed treatment are recommended to consult one of the 
specialised monographs on the subject. 1 5 

A. 1.2 PRIMARY SOURCES - JOURNALS 

Scientific journals are the principal method for communicating scientific in- 
formation. The majority of papers abstracted by Chemical Abstracts is in 
English. These original papers are complemented by a range of other less- used 
primary literature such as patents, dissertations and theses, and reports of vari- 
ous kinds. Although a great number of journals are published which contain in- 
formation of interest to the chemist, only a small proportion of them regularly 
contain material which is directly and immediately useful to the organic chemist, 
The most important journals dealing with organic chemistry are listed below. 
The standard abbreviation listed in the Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index 
(CASSI) is given in parenthesis.

A. 1.3 SECONDARY SOURCES - ABSTRACTS 

Abstracting journals are publications giving contemporaneous, concise sum- 
maries of the various original journals and other contributions to knowledge. 
Each abstract usually supplies the title of the original paper, names of authors, 
original reference (i.e. name of journal, year of publication, volume or series 
number, page) and generally a brief summary of the paper. The value of the 
abstract in the first instance will depend on how detailed the summary is. It must 
be emphasised, however, that the reader should never be satisfied with the 
account to be found in the abstract. If at all possible the original work should be 
consulted. The only abstracting journal in English covering all fields of 
chemistry and chemical technology is Chemical Abstracts published by the 
American Chemical Society. All organic chemists should be familiar with the use 
of Chemical Abstracts. Other abstracting journals such as Biological Abstracts 
may contain information of interest to the organic chemist. 

Chemical Abstracts was first published in 1907 and has continued ever since. 

1402 



APPENDIX 1 

About 14000 journals are monitored but only about 300 are abstracted com- 
pletely. Chemical Abstracts Service Source Index (CASSI) provides a compre- 
hensive list of journals currently abstracted by Chemical Abstracts. Two 
volumes of Chemical Abstracts are published each year, in 1988 volumes 108 and 
1 09, and every five years a Collective Index is published covering the ten 
volumes published during the period. The publication of the Eleventh Collective 
Index, covering Volumes 96-105 (1982-86), was completed in 1988. The docu- 
ments abstracted by Chemical Abstracts include journal articles, patents, 
reviews, technical reports, monographs, conference proceedings, symposia, dis- 
sertations and books. The abstracts are divided into eighty sections. The reader 
should consult Subject Coverage and Arrangement of Abstracts by Sections in 
Chemical Abstracts - 1982 published by Chemical Abstracts Services for a de- 
scription of the subject coverage of each of the eighty sections. Chemical 
Abstracts appears weekly, each week containing alternately Sections 1-34 
(Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry sections) and Sections 35-80 (Macro- 
molecular Chemistry; Applied Chemistry and Chemical Engineering; and 
Physical, Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry sections). Each weekly issue of 
Chemical Abstracts contains two parts, the abstracts and the issue index (key- 
word, patent and author index). An Illustrative Key is included at the start of 
each new volume (which covers a six-month period) to assist the reader in the 
most effective use of the abstracts, and readers are recommended to consult this 
key for more detailed information than can be included in the present summary. 
Abstracts are numbered consecutively throughout each volume. Since 1976 
(Volume 84), each abstract is immediately preceded by the volume number in 
lightface type, and followed by a computer-generated check-letter by which each 
reference is computer validated. Check letters have been in use since 1966 
(Volume 66) and should not be confused with the column fractional designa- 
tions (a-g) previously used to indicate the position of the abstract on the page. 
The indexes of Chemical Abstracts are a key to the world's chemical and 
chemical engineering literature. There are six different indexes and care and 
practice are required to make effective use of them. In the Chemical Substance 
Index specified substances are identified and ordered by name; the General Sub- 
ject Index lists classes of substances and general subjects; the Formula Index lists 
specific substances according to their molecular formula; in the Index of Ring 
Systems cyclic skeletons and stereoparents are identified and ordered by ring 
analysis; the Patent Index, which replaces the Numerical Patent Index and 
Patent Concordance, contains information on patent documents; and the Author 
Index links the names of authors to the corresponding abstract. Explanatory 
and illustrative matter relating to indexing is published separately as the Index 
Guide. Each Collective Index has its own Index Guide. The initial Index Guide 
for the Twelfth Collective Index (1987-91) was published in 1987 and will be 
revised and reissued three times during the five-year period. The Index Guides 
provide complete instructions on the use of Chemical Abstracts and also a com- 
prehensive account of the policies for selecting the names of chemical substances 
in Chemical Abstracts. Appendix II of the Index Guide describes the organisation 
and use of the indexes and the relationship between them. In addition, Chemical 
Abstracts Service produces a workbook which provides further instruction on 
the use of Chemical Abstracts. The Ring Systems Handbook (1984) is a tool for 
searching Chemical Abstracts for specific ring systems, it provides a file of dia- 
grams of ring systems (59 510 in the 1984 edition) together with indexes of 

1403 



PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



molecular formulae and ring names. The Ring Systems Handbook replaced the 
Parent Compounds Handbook which in turn replaced the Ring Index. 

An additional method for the cross-referencing of chemical substances is the 
Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry system. It is a computer-based 
system that assigns to each substance a unique identifying number called a 
registry number. The numbers have no chemical significance, but are assigned in 
sequential order as substances are entered into the system for the first time. 
Operation of the CAS registry system began in 1965. By August 1980 5 million 
compounds had been registered and new substances are being recorded at the 
rate of about 300000 per year. The Registry Handbook includes in registry 
number order all substances that have been recorded since the system began, to- 
gether with the molecular formula of each and one complete Chemical Abstracts 
index name. Registry numbers thus provide a means of structure identification 
without the need to resort to complex and sometimes ambiguous chemical 
nomenclature. A Registry Number Update is published annually. It provides a 
means of determining whether a registry number is still valid, and should always 
be consulted before using the Registry Handbook. 

A useful abstracts journal specifically devoted to organic synthesis is the 
Journal of Synthetic Methods. This developed as an expansion and adaptation of 
Theilheimer's Methods of Organic Chemistry (see Section A 1.4.3 below). About 
6000 reactions reported in the literature are included annually. Of these, about 
3000 are presented as abstracts and the remainder, mainly modifications and 
improvements, are given as supplementary references. 



A1.4 TERTIARY SOURCES - REVIEWS, MONOGRAPHS, REFERENCE 
WORKS 

There is a wide range of publications which gather together information from 
the published primary literature and organise and present it in a way which may 
be of value to the organic chemist. These publications range from comprehens- 
ive reference works such as Beilstein to the more recent series of specialist 
reports, such as those published by the Royal Society of Chemistry, which 
review the recent literature on one topic of specialist interest. 

A1.4.1 BEILSTEIN 

Beilstein's Handbook of Organic Chemistry (Beilstein's Handbuch der Organi- 
schen Chemie) is the largest compilation of information on organic compounds. 
Earlier volumes were published in German, but since 1984 it has been published 
in English; an indispensible guide to its use is available as Notes for Users of 
Beilstein's Handbook of Organic Chemistry, of which the following account is an 
extract. 6 

INTRODUCTION 

The Beilstein Handbook of Organic Chemistry (Beilstein's Handbook der Organi- 
schen Chemie) is a reference work containing information and data relating to 
the structure, preparation and properties of organic compounds reported in the 
primary literature. The information is condensed into short entries, each of 



1404 



APPENDIX 1 

which records the important facts and numerical data relating to a particular 
compound, complete with literature citations, to achieve a very high density of 
information in the Handbook. 

The Handbook is published in several series, each of which deals with the 
organic compounds reported in the literature during a given period; for each 
compound there is only one entry within a series. Publication of the Fourth edi- 
tion (Vierte Auflage) started in 1918; it consists of the Basic Series (Hauptwerk), 
which covers all the compounds reported up to 1910, and Supplementary Series 
(Ergdnzungswerke) which cover succeeding periods as indicated in Table A 1.1.

* Volumes 17 to 27 of Series E III and E IV are combined in a joint issue. 

Within each series of the Handbook the entries are ordered using the Beil- 
stein System of Compound Classification; this is a set of rules which enables 
each organic compound to be assigned a position within the Handbook solely 
on the basis of its molecular structure; conversely, knowledge of the rules 
enables any compound from the c. 1 million compounds already described in the 
Handbook to be found rapidly, purely on the basis of its structure. A further 
advantage of the system is that many structurally related compounds are 
brought together within the same volume of the Handbook. 

The Handbook is divided into 27 volumes (volume = Band), many of which 
run to several subvolumes; each compound is assigned to its particular volume, 
firstly on the basis of its skeletal structure, and secondly according to its func- 
tional groups. Within the individual volumes the ordering is based on structural 
features such as the type and number of functional groups, the degree of unsat- 
uration, the number of carbon atoms and other similar criteria, until each com- 
pound has been assigned its position within the series. To use the Handbook 
effectively, however, it is not necessary to know all the rules of the Beilstein 
System, but merely to be able to identify in which of the 27 volumes the com- 
pound is described; this is outlined in the following sections. A more detailed de- 
scription with worked examples is to be found in the booklet How to Use 
Beilstein (also available in German and Japanese) which, together with other in- 
formative material about the Beilstein Handbook, may be obtained free of 
charge by writing to

PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



For those users of the Beilstein Handbook who are unfamiliar with the Ger- 
man language, a pocket-size Beilstein Dictionary (German/English) has been 
compiled by the Beilstein editorial staff and is also available free of charge. The 
contents of this dictionary are also to be found on the green pages in either of the 
subvolumes E III/IV 22/7 or E IV 6/4. 

LOCATING COMPOUNDS IN THE BEILSTEIN HANDBOOK 

The best way of finding the entry for a particular compound in the Beilstein 
Handbook is to identify in which volume the compound is listed, and then to 
consult the appropriate volume index. In order to identify the volume of interest 
a few basic principles of the Beilstein System need to be understood and these 
are described below. 

For the purpose of classification in the Beilstein System, all organic com- 
pounds are divided into three basic types, viz. acyclic compounds (Volumes 1- 
4), isocyclic (i.e. carbocyclic) compounds (Volumes 5-16), and heterocyclic com- 
pounds (Volumes 17-27). Heterocyclic compounds are further subdivided 
according to the nature and number of the ring heteroatoms. All heterocycles

APPENDIX 1 

containing chalcogen (oxygen, sulphur, etc.) atoms as the only type of ring 
heteroatom are covered in Volumes 17-19; those with one chalcogen ring atom 
(hetero: 1 O) in Volumes 1 7 and 1 8, and those with two or more (hetero: 2 O, 
3 O, . . . etc.) in Volume 19. Heterocycles containing nitrogen as the only type of 
ring heteroatom are covered in Volumes 20-26; all other heterocyclic com- 
pounds, including those with both chalcogen and nitrogen ring heteroatoms, are 
dealt with in Volume 27 (further details are given in Table A 1 .2). 

The position of the entry for any compound is determined by that fragment of 
its structure which is classified latest in the Beilstein System. Thus, for example, a 
compound containing a heterocyclic ring, a carbocyclic ring and an aliphatic 
chain is classified as a heterocycle, irrespective of the other structural elements, 
since all heterocycles are ordered after acyclic and isocyclic compounds in the 
Beilstein System. This feature of the systematic classification of compounds is 
called the Principle of Latest Systematic Entry. 

Further classification of compounds within the divisions described above is 
based upon the type and number of the functional groups which they contain. At 
this level it is necessary to distinguish between 

1. registry compounds, and 

2. derivatives of registry compounds. 

Registry compounds are defined as hydrocarbons or heterocycles which bear 
either no functional groups (i.e. parent compounds), or one or more of the func- 
tional groups listed in Table A 1.2, bonded to carbon atoms; no carbon atom, 
however, may bear more than one functional group.* Three further restrictions 
apply to heterocyclic rings: the ring must contain at least one carbon atom; ring 
heteroatoms may neither be substituted nor bear functional groups; the ring 
must not contain chalcogen atoms other than oxygen as ring heteroatoms. 
Compounds which do not conform to these criteria are classified as derivatives 
(see below). 

The volume of the Handbook containing the entry for any particular registry 
compound may be identified directly from Table A 1 .2 on the basis of its skeletal 
framework and functional groups. For compounds containing two or more dif- 
ferent groups, the Principle of Latest Systematic Entry is again applied, and each 
compound is classified under the functional group which appears lowest in the 
list in Table A 1 .2. For example, 4-hydroxy-benzenesulphonic acid is classified as 
an isocyclic sulphonic acid (Volume 11), and not as an isocyclic hydroxy- 
compound (Volume 6). In some cases, e.g. isocyclic amines, the second type of 
functional group is important to determine in which volume the compound will 
be dealt with; thus benzene- 1 ,4-diamine (without a second type of functional 
group) is in Volume 13, whereas 4-amino-benzoic acid is in Volume 14. 



In carboxylic acids, the functional group consists only of the — OH and =0 groups.

All other compounds which cannot be classified as registry compounds are 
derivatives of registry compounds; they are not necessarily derived in the chem- 
ical sense but they are structurally related. 

Derivatives of registry compounds are defined as compounds in which one or 
more of the following types of structural modification of the registry compounds 
occur: 

(a) Modification of a functional group or the carbon atom bearing a functional 
group, e.g. acetyl chloride is classified as a derivative of the registry 
compound acetic acid. 

(b) Substitution of hydrogen atoms, which are not bonded to carbon atoms 
bearing functional groups, by the following atoms and groups (which are 
classed as substituents and not as functional groups) 

F CI Br I NO N0 2 N 3 N 5 ( = pentazolyl) 
e.g. 4-chloro-phenol is classified as a derivative of phenol. 

(c) Replacement of one or more oxygen atoms in the registry compound by 
other bivalent chalcogen atoms, e.g. thiophene is the suophur analogue of 
furan and is thus classified as a 'derivative'. 

Derivatives are entered in the Handbook following the entry for the registry 
compound; the order is again determined by the Beilstein System. (If the registry 
compound was not reported in the literature covered by a particular series, its 
entry is omitted, but this does not affect the ordering of its derivatives in the 
Handbook.)

PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



Reagents for Organic Synthesis, L. F. Fieser and M. Fieser. New York: Wiley- 
Interscience. Volumes 1-12, 1967-86. These twelve volumes provide a wealth 
of information drawn from the current literature, on the nature and use of 
hundreds of reagents used in organic synthesis. References are given to the 
original literature, and each succeeding volume provides references to the 
mention of each of the reagents in earlier volumes. This series is an essential 
reference manual for the practical organic chemist. 

Organic Reactions. Began publication in 1942, Volume 34 (1986). Each volume 
contains detailed surveys of a small number of named reactions, with a range 
of typical experimental procedures. 

Comprehensive Organic Chemistry (1982), in six volumes. Eds D. H. R. Barton 
and W. D. Ollis. Oxford: Pergamon. 

Comprehensive Heterocyclic Chemistry (1984), in eight volumes. Eds A. R. 
Katritzky and C. W. Rees. Oxford: Pergamon. 

Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds. Eds A. Weissberger and E. C. Taylor. 
Very detailed accounts of chemistry of particular heterocyclic systems, total- 
ling over 100 volumes. 

C. A. Buehler and D. E. Pearson (1970). Survey of Organic Syntheses. New York: 
Wiley. 

Techniques of Chemistry. Ed. A. Weissberger. London: Interscience, 1971 
onwards. (Successor to Techniques of Organic Chemistry.) Comprehensive 
treatment covering theoretical background, description of techniques and 
tools, their modifications, merits and limitations, and their handling. 

A 1.4.4 REVIEWS 

With the increasing volume of primary literature, reviews and surveys of par- 
ticular areas of activity are essential for the organic chemist. Some of the import- 
ant review publications are Chemical Society Reviews, Chemical Reviews, 
Accounts of Chemical Research, Angewandte Chemie (International Edition in 
English), Russian Chemical Reviews, Survey of Progress in Chemistry. In addi- 
tion there are a number of series of Advances in . . . and Progress in . . . various 
aspects of organic chemistry. The Specialist Periodical Reports, published by the 
Royal Society of Chemistry, London, provide systematic and comprehensive 
reviews of progress in major areas of research. Current titles include: General 
and Synthetic Methods; Carbohydrate Chemistry; Amino Acids and Peptides; 
Heterocyclic Chemistry; Organometallic Chemistry; Organophosphorus 
Chemistry. 

A1.5 COMPUTERISED STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL OF INFORMATION 

This is a rapidly developing subject. There is an increasing number of on-line 
databases readily available to the organic chemist. It is likely that all organic 
chemists will require skills to conduct searches of such databases in future. Any 
advanced course in organic chemistry should therefore provide an introduction 
to on-line searching techniques in order to provide the basis for development 
later in the student's career. A detailed account of this field is beyond the scope 
of this appendix and would in any case date rapidly. The reader is referred to 
recent monographs for further information. 4-7

A1.6 CURRENT AWARENESS 

A general level of scientific awareness can be maintained from perusal of such 
periodicals as Nature and Science. In chemistry, such journals as the Journal of 
the American Chemical Society and Chemical Communications will keep the 
organic chemist in touch. At the specific level of particular aspects of organic 
chemistry it is necessary to scan a limited range of journals such as those listed in 
Section A 1 .2 above. The chemist is helped in this task by current awareness pub- 
lications such as Current Contents published by ISI (Institute for Scientific In- 
formation) and Current Titles published by Chemical Abstracts Service. Each of 
these provides information on the contents of research journals in a particular 
field of interest. Neither gives direct access to the research journals but they pro- 
vide an indicator of material of possible interest. Chemical Abstracts also pub- 
lishes a range of current awareness bulletins known as CA Selects. Titles include 
Asymmetric Synthesis and Induction, Electrochemical Organic Synthesis, 
Natural Product Synthesis, etc. In the field of organic synthesis, Methods of 
Organic Synthesis published by the Royal Society of Chemistry provides cover- 
age of about 200 items each month.

PRACTICAL ORGANIC CHEMISTRY 



HAZARD SYMBOLS 

Legislation on packaging and labelling of dangerous substances defines hazardous chem- 
icals under the following categories: 



C k$k 







Toxic 
T 



Corrosive 
C 




Oxidising 
O 





Highly 
Flammable/ 
Flammable 
F 



Harmful 
Xn 



Toxic These products can cause death or serious illness when small amounts enter the 
body by ingestion, inhalation of vapour, fumes or dust, or by absorption through the 
skin; hygiene considerations should be rigorously observed. 

Corrosive These products may destroy living tissue; eyes are particularly susceptible. 
Emergency showers should be available. If swallowed plenty of water should be given 
after immediate mouth rinsing. 

Explosive These products may explode by the action of heat, sources of ignition, shock or 
friction. The compounds are often packaged wet to reduce the risk of explosion; they will 
become dangerous if allowed to dry. Some compounds form sensitive explosive salts on 
contact with metals. 

Oxidising These compounds may cause fire and will always assist combustion. They pro- 
duce heat on contact with organic matter and reducing agents. 

Flammable These compounds have a low flash point, and those which react with water 
or damp air to give rise to flammable gases (e.g. hydrogen) from metal hydrides. Ignition 
sources include Bunsen burners, hot metal surfaces, electric sparks, etc. Fire fighting 
equipment should be readily available and frequently checked. 

Harmful Irritant chemicals cause inflammation of the skin, mucous membranes, or dis- 
comfort of the respiratory system. All laboratory chemicals should be regarded as harm- 
ful; some are specifically harmful by skin contact, inhalation or swallowing.

ivailable to the organic chemist, and retains many of the standard pi 
of previous editions These are all set within a theoretical framework based on 
developments m the strategy and methodology of organic synthesis, reflecting the 
fundamental changes in approach to the subject made during the last decade. 

n&gt; litis edition: 

• \n introductory chapter on the structural and theoretical principles required 
when designing a synthesis. 

• Hie disconnection or synthon approach now integrated into the text, ami the 
principles of retrosynthetic analysis applied to relevant aliphatic, aromatic. 
alicyclic and heterocyclic compounds, 

• Synthesis methodology is expanded to covet a range of new reagents, including 
oxidants and 1 iithcsis; and those derived 
from lithium, bourn, silicon, phosphorus and sulphur. 

• Recent developments in reaction techniques which include: handling of air- 
sensitive and moisture-sensitive compounds; new chromatographic procedures: 

phase transfei eatalvsis: ami solid support reagents 

• Over I (Ml new experiments selected from the literature to illustrate lit 

and techniques, ami the operation ol protection, selectivity ami control in 
synthesis. 

• A more detailed trcatmi on-13 n.m.i spectroscopy, and the interpre- 
tation ot spectroscopic data lor many of the synthesised compout
